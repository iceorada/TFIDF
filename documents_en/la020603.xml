<LD>One of the myths about growing old in America is that retiree health
insurance from your old job, or the government's Medicare program,
will pay the bill for nursing home care, which can run $50,000 a
year. Forget about it. The reality is that you are on your own when
it comes to paying for a prolonged stay in a nursing home or hiring
someone to come to your house to help you get bathed and dressed.</LD>
<LD>   This issue, which has social and emotional aspects too, is growing
more pressing with the graying of the baby boom generation. Today,
there are about 5 million Americans over 65 who need some help with
the basic activities of daily living. That number will probably
double, to 10 million, by 2030, when the eldest boomers hit 65.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government will pay for nursing home care, but only if
you become a pauper. If you go into a nursing home and gradually
erase your life savings, down to the last $2,000, then you qualify
for federal help. The program is called Medicaid (Medi-Cal in
California). This becomes real to most people only when they must
place a parent or grandparent in a nursing home and are shocked to
learn that Medicare, the federal health program for those over 65,
won't cover the costs.</LD>
<TE>   Many people are misinformed or confused about how Medicare works.
The federal health program will help pay for fixing a broken arm,
removing an inflamed appendix or repairing a damaged heart through
coronary bypass surgery. But it won't pay a dime for ordinary care in
a nursing home, for the routine daily maintenance and feeding of
somebody with Alzheimer's disease or for someone permanently
incapacitated by a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion is that Medicare will pay for some nursing
home stays, said Elinor Ginzler, director of assisted living and
long-term care for AARP. For example, Medicare will pay when a
patient has hip surgery and goes from the hospital to a nursing home
for a brief period to recover and needs some physical therapy. The
Medicare benefit provides up to 100 days in a skilled-nursing
facility, with the first 20 days free. Unless a person is recovering
from a specific illness or injury, Medicare will not pay for routine
care, such as bathing, feeding and dressing.</TE>
<TE>   Congress, worried about the future financial solvency of Medicare,
isn't going to bust the budget by expanding benefits to include
nursing home care. Instead, the legislators want to encourage
Americans to take responsibility themselves by buying insurance
against the risk of needing some type of nursing home care.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance enables people to pay for nursing home care without
depleting their financial assets. They can retain their savings
accounts, stocks and bonds to pay for living costs as they age, or to
preserve as an inheritance for heirs.</TE>
<TE>   This coverage is called long-term care insurance, and only about 6
million people have such policies. To help encourage this type of
coverage, the federal government is offering the insurance to federal
workers and members of the military and their spouses and parents.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government wants to be a role model for other
employers that might be interested in offering this insurance--there
is no question that it is cheaper when you buy it in a group," said
the AARP's Ginzler.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in July, the government will allow current federal
workers, members of the armed forces and retirees from federal
agencies and the military to purchase long-term care policies. Also
eligible will be their children over the age of 18, their spouses,
and their parents and parents-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   The policies must be purchased by Dec. 31. After that, the
government will decide whether to provide another opportunity for
people to buy the policies.</TE>
<TE>   The coverage will be about 15% to 20% cheaper, on average, than
policies available on the market for people in average health.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the policy will be an important part of the compensation
package, and we have to remain contemporary in the coverage," said
Frank Titus, who is directing the program for the federal Office of
Personnel Management.</TE>
<TE>   Benefits will range from $50 a day to $300 a day. The money for
benefits is provided in a pool of coverage, with the funds available
to be used in several different ways: to pay for someone hired to
provide care at home; for use in an assisted-living facility,
typically apartment-type settings; or for nursing homes, where
custodial care is required.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify, an individual must need help with at least two of six
basic activities of daily living: bathing, dressing, toileting
(getting to the bathroom and using the toilet), continence (control
of bladder and bowels), eating and transferring (getting in and out
of bed or chairs).</TE>
<TE>   The policy also will pay benefits to someone with severe cognitive
impairment, a loss of memory or reasoning ability that "places you in
jeopardy of harming yourself or others and therefore in need of
substantial supervision by another person," the OPM said in its
policy material. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cognitive
disorder that would trigger benefit payments.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials hope to change the normal buying pattern in the
industry, to encourage people to purchase the policy at a younger
age, when they can lock in lower premiums. Typically, long-term care
policies are now being purchased by people in their early 60s, and
used 20 years later. The average person who goes into a nursing home
for an extended stay is usually older than 80.</TE>
<TE>   A special innovation of the federal policy is that benefits can be
paid to family members who act as caregivers. This does not apply to
spouses or others living with the person needing care.</TE>
<TE>   But suppose an adult daughter visits her father and provides care.
She can receive up to 75% of the daily benefit rate for taking care
of her father. She can get paid for a total of 365 days over the term
of the insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who don't qualify for the government program, here
are some tips to keep in mind when considering long-term care
insurance:</TE>
<TE>   * Get a policy with a pool of money that can be used at your
discretion at home or in a nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   * Take the longest waiting period you can afford to keep down the
cost of the policy. If you can pay without financial hardship for the
first 90 days of care in a nursing home, get a policy with a 90-day
waiting period before benefits begin. This will lower your premium.</TE>
<TE>   * Purchase a policy that offers protection against inflation, a
policy that automatically increases the value of the benefit each
year to keep pace with rising costs. A 21/2-year stay in a nursing
home costs $130,000, on average, now, but is expected to climb to
$495,000 by 2030, according to an insurance industry study.</TE>
<TE>   California and three other states--New York, Indiana and
Connecticut--have special programs enabling people to keep their own
money and still qualify for government help.</TE>
<TE>   California has a Partnership for Long Term Care program allowing
people to shelter more of their financial assets and still be
eligible for Medi-Cal, which pays for nursing home care for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   A Shopper's Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance is available from
the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners, 2301 McGee St., Suite
800, Kansas City, MO 64108. Contact the group at (816) 842-3600 or at

<LD>Every so often, we are honored to help out a reader in this column.
Once someone sent in one of her hairs (they'd gone white, and she
wanted to know why). Another time a couple having a marital dispute
asked about the right way to clean a chopping board. This week's
query is about diabetes--a far more serious topic, since the malady
affects 17 million people in the U.S. alone. "When," asks a reader,
"was the disease discovered, and from that time, what efforts were
made to manage it?"</LD>
<LD>   At your service, Mr. Fuller.</LD>
<LD>   First, about that name: Diabetes is Greek for "siphoning," or "go
through." The term was coined around 250 BC because of the excessive
urination.</LD>
<TE>   But people knew about the ailment far earlier--had noted the
urination, crazed thirst and wasting of the flesh at least as far
back as 1500 BC. The Hindus even noted that ants could help out with
diagnosis. Black ants (and flies) were unusually attracted to the
sufferer's urine because of all the sugar in it.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the reason for the second part of the name: mellitus, Latin
for "honey."</TE>
<TE>   No one knew what caused it (namely, improper production or
responses to a key sugar-regulating hormone--insulin--made by the
pancreas). But they certainly waxed theoretical. Aretaeus of
Cappadocia, a 2nd century Greek physician, seemed to believe that the
flow of urine and the body's wasting were intricately linked. "Many
parts of the flesh pass out along with the urine," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Diabetes was awful in ancient times. A kid coming down with it
would often last mere days.</TE>
<TE>   Not that medical sages of the times weren't trying. Over the
centuries, they threw a plethora of herbs, salves and other remedies
at the disorder. Aretaeus thought the key was to stymie the excessive
thirst by strengthening the stomach with purging, plant infusions and
acidic wine. The 7th century Greek physician Paul of Aegena
prescribed "pot-herbs, endive, lettuce, rock-fishes, juices of
knotgrass, elecampane in dark-colored wine and dedoctions of dates
and myrtle." He also recommended "cataplasms to the
hypochondrium"--which sound nasty but in fact were merely poultices
applied to the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   The 10th century Persian physician Avicenna recommended
exercise--ideally on horseback--to provide friction and thus to
temper the incessant urination.</TE>
<TE>   Much later, after bleeding, blistering, vein-cutting and more were
also touted as helpful, doctors tried with a small measure of success
to control the ailment using low-carbohydrate diets. Only in the
early 20th century did scientists finally purify insulin.</TE>
<TE>   Here are a few high points in the diabetes discovery timeline:</TE>
<TE>   * In 1869, the German anatomist Paul Langerhans discovered some
distinctive structures in the pancreas--though he didn't know what
they were for. To this day, they're known as the "islets of
Langerhans."</TE>
<TE>   * In 1899, two other German scientists--Joseph von Mering and
Oscar Minkowski--discovered that removing the pancreas from a dog
resulted in a diabetic dog. It was an accidental discovery: The two
were merely trying to figure out the pancreas' role in digestion.</TE>
<TE>   * Insulin--the hormone made by the Langerhans islets--was purified
in the early '20s by four scientists in Canada: Frederick Grant
Banting, John James Richard Macleod, Charles Herbert Best and James
B. Collip. They'd figured out a way to extract the hormone without it
getting chewed up by other enzymes.</TE>
<TE>   When they gave their extract to dogs without pancreases, those
dogs survived for months instead of mere days--though if given too
much, they'd lapse into comas. A dose of glucose would save them.</TE>
<TE>   The first human patient, in 1922, was a 14-year-old boy with
diabetes. He reacted badly to the early preparations, developing
abscesses on the injection site, and more. But after Collip further
purified the extract, he did well--lived, indeed, for another 13
years.</TE>
<TE>   A Nobel Prize for insulin was awarded in 1923, but it ticked off a
lot of scientists. Some raged about the omission of names like Von
Mering and Minkowski. And they raged about other omissions. Only
Banting and Macleod got the prize, even though Best, by all accounts,
had done more work than Macleod. Banting was furious.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Banting shared his prize money with Best, and Macleod
shared his with Collip. But that wasn't the end of the bad blood.
Banting and Collip once came to physical blows after Collip refused
to divulge some of his insulin-purification methods. Bickering among
the four continued for years.</TE>

<LD>A general economic rule of thumb is that when the price of something
goes up, the demand goes down. The exceptions to the rule are certain
luxury goods such as high-end cars, designer clothes and, according
to a new survey, cosmetic surgery.</LD>
<LD>   A team of surgeons and an economist surveyed members of the
American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery about
the frequency and fees of four common cosmetic procedures in 1989 and
1999. They found that when the price of a face or brow lift or an eye
or nose job increased, so did the demand.</LD>
<LD>   "People tend to feel that if a surgeon is expensive, they're
getting something special," says Dr. Ramsey Alsarraf, a surgeon at
the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston. "The surgeons who
are charging $15,000-$20,000 for a face lift are probably good
surgeons or else they wouldn't survive." But that doesn't mean that a
less expensive surgeon doesn't do as good a job, he says.</LD>
<TE>   "There is that BMW/Mercedes mentality. If it's a name that you've
read about in Vogue then the belief is that he has to be good,"
Alsarraf says.</TE>
<TE>   Alsarraf, who is also the co-author of the textbook "The Aging
Face: A Systematic Approach," suggests that prospective patients not
only check the doctor's credentials, but that they ask questions
about whether he or she has published articles in medical journals or
written a textbook. Also, does the surgeon train other doctors? Does
he or she have an academic affiliation? If the doctor uses a private
surgical suite, does he or she also have operating privileges at a
hospital?</TE>

<TE>   High Blood Pressure Could Be Result of Mom and Dad's Behavior</TE>
<TE>   Your genetic heritage may put you at risk for health problems such
as cancer and heart disease, but scientists are learning that
behaviors learned from parents also may play an important role. Take
high blood pressure, for instance. The way a person learned to
respond to stress could influence whether he or she will have high
blood pressure, just like Mom and Dad.</TE>
<TE>   In a study that measured heart rate, blood pressure and behavioral
responses to stress, 32 healthy college students whose mother, father
or both had hypertension were compared with 32 whose parents didn't
have it. When put through several stressful situations, such as
having to solve a difficult math problem and role-playing a stressful
encounter, those with a family history of hypertension had an
increase in blood pressure--and they tended to behave negatively.
They rolled their eyes, sighed and made more disagreeing statements
than the students whose parents didn't have hypertension.</TE>
<TE>   If these behavior styles are a risk factor for heart disease, the
West Virginia University researchers concluded, then learning new
skills for dealing with conflict and stress might lower one's chances
of following in parental footsteps health-wise.</TE>

<TE>   UC Davis Study Aims to Boost Participation in Cancer Trials</TE>
<TE>   Clinical trials offer people with cancer the opportunity to try
experimental treatments that may be more effective than the current
standard of care, but only 2% to 3% of Americans with cancer enroll
in the trials.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Davis Cancer Center has an unusually high participation
rate--about 14% of its patients newly diagnosed with cancer enter a
clinical trial. In an continuing study at the Sacramento center,
researchers observed interactions between doctors, doctors and
patients, and patients and their families. The results of the first
phase of the study were presented in May at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers identified several broad categories of barriers
that keep people from joining a trial.</TE>
<TE>   The problems include a patient's lack of financial resources;
health insurance issues; confusion about study procedures and the
differences between the care received in the clinical trial and
routine medical care; and misunderstanding the illness and its
severity.</TE>
<TE>   "Practical information about how participating in a trial will fit
into their lives is what's needed," says Debora A. Paterniti, an
assistant adjunct professor of medicine at the Center for Health
Services Research in Primary Care at UC Davis. "Most people haven't
been involved in any scientific enterprise before so they aren't
familiar with concepts like randomization."</TE>
<TE>   The researchers are now doing in-depth interviews with patients in
hopes of developing strategies for improving understanding of, and
recruiting to, trials. Paterniti already has some advice of people
considering this option: Read the consent form and ask questions.</TE>
<TE>   Surgery Complications Not Uncommon, Hospital Finds</TE>
<TE>   Surgery may be riskier than we think, and no one knows for sure
what the complication rate is for many operations. That's what
prompted University of Vermont researchers to look at the major and
minor complications that occurred in their own hospital during an
18-month period. Although the number of deaths at their hospital was
comparable to others across the nation, the Vermont researchers found
that complication rates were two to four times higher than those
provided by a recent Institute of Medicine report.</TE>
<TE>   Mark A. Healey, assistant professor of surgery at the University
of Vermont, and his colleagues also found that nearly half of the
complications following general surgery, trauma surgery and
cardiothoracic surgery at their hospital were "provider related,"
meaning they probably could have been avoided. However, true
negligence was unusual, Healey says.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is led to believe that if you go to a good surgeon in
a good hospital that you will fly through surgery with no
complications. When something goes wrong, they think something
substandard has occurred. And that has set people up for
deteriorating expectations of doctors. Complications do occur and ...
frequently, Healey says."</TE>

<LD>We know men and women think differently, often using opposite sides
of the brain to do the same task. Now scientists suspect this
difference may be evolutionary, a vestige of the hunter-gatherer era
when survival of the tribe hinged upon a division of labor between
men and women.</LD>
<LD>   University of Saskatchewan researchers, in a study published in
the June issue of Behavioral Neuroscience, discovered sharp gender
differences in navigational strat- egies. A group of 42 college
students--22 women and 20 men--were asked to find four unknown
destinations on campus using written instructions. Half were given
directions in the form of directional cues and measured distances: Go
north for 100 meters, then proceed east for 500 meters, for example.
The others were given photos of landmarks in sequential order to use
as guides, with instructions such as to turn right at the purple
doors.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate experiment, 40 students, equally divided between men
and women, were given a different navigational task that required
them to map out the correct route on a sheet of paper. Half were
given directional cues; the other half received landmark guides.</LD>
<TE>   Both tests came to roughly the same conclusion: Women were more
proficient when they used landmarks to find their way, which is a
strategy that relies more on verbal descriptions. Men were better at
employing measures of distance and directions to plot the correct
course, which suggests men are better at visualizing abstract spatial
relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists speculate that this spatial skill, a left-brain
function, may have become predominant when hunters had to find their
way over long distances without the benefit of landmarks. "Evolution
favored men with this type of knowledge of the environment," says
Deborah M. Saucier, a study coauthor and psychologist at the
university, in Saskatoon, Canada. Women needed to keep track of where
they planted vegetables or stored food, so the right-brained
descriptive landmarks were key.</TE>
<TE>   These findings also suggest an answer to the age-old question: Why
won't men ask for directions when they're lost? "This seems to be an
innate bias," says Saucier. "Men use spatial strategies, while women
have much better verbal skills."</TE>

<LD>Oh, he floats through the air</LD>
<LD>   With the greatest of ease,</LD>
<LD>   This daring young man</LD>
<TE>   On the flying trapeze ...</TE>
<TE>   I had loved this man since I was a child, just like the girl who
ran away to join the circus with him in the song. Old fantasies die
hard, so the other Saturday I signed up my husband and myself for a
Circus Sports class at Crunch fitness club in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The class description said students would "fly through the air
tumble forward and backward ... and spend a lot of time upside down."
Could it be true?</TE>
<TE>   There comes a time when your body says it doesn't want to hang
upside down, swing from the rings or do headstands or cartwheels. For
most people that occurs around age 6. But it sounded as though the
circus class would let you defy gravity, age and your own diminished
adult expectations.</TE>
<TE>   My husband and I arrived in loose clothes, ready to tumble. As the
yoga class before us ended, the three circus teachers rushed into the
glass-walled classroom to unfold mats and unfurl the rings and
trapeze concealed in the beams.</TE>
<TE>   There were 15 of us--11 women and four men. The first 20 minutes
would be warmups, the next 20 tumbling, and the final 20 would be
spent--at last!--on the rings and trapeze, explained Robert Carreiro,
one of three teachers for the class. Besides Carreiro, who is 60,
there was David St. Pierre, 34, and Paul Naylor, 29. All three are
retired national gymnastics champions.</TE>
<TE>   Quickly it became clear why there are so many teachers.</TE>
<TE>   We ran through a conventional cycle of sit-ups, push-ups and
stretches to limber us up. Within 10 minutes they had the whole class
doing backbends. Upside down, I sneaked a peek to my left. The woman
beside me had her feet practically to her ears, her back arched into
a perfect bend like a wishbone.</TE>
<TE>   "I do contortion," she explained during a break. I felt a pang of
fear. This is L.A. Had we wandered into a class full of stunt people?</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, while there were some bolder, exhibitionist
types in the class, most students were just average people with an
outsize fun-seeking streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Now for some feats of great courage," said Carreiro, and we lined
up, excited as circus-goers.</TE>
<TE>   It started simply. We were asked to do somersaults down the mats,
like toddlers. But even a somersault can be dangerous for an
uncoordinated adult. The teachers stood by, ready to spot. Some
students rolled over easily, tumbling at high speed down the line of
blue mats. Other adults seemed to have forgotten how to bend their
necks, and got stuck on their heads like inverted Buddhas. They would
have flopped over on their backs if the spotters had not been there
to fold their rigid bodies into submission and ease their landings.
Students finished their run of somersaults looking dizzy. I almost
walked into the glass wall.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the class rapidly divided into regulars (acrobatic,
advanced) and first- or second-timers (clumsy, timid). Newer students
yelped with terror and delight as they were pulled upside down and
into unusual positions.</TE>
<TE>   We graduated quickly to cartwheels. Then one-armed cartwheels.
Then round-offs. Then handstands with a roll-out. Always, the
spotters were there to coach and to catch.</TE>
<TE>   I recovered from my own cartwheels just in time to see two men
hoisting my husband's legs into the air, helping him spin onto his
hands, up into the air and over. He did a cartwheel! One student
commented on how amazing it was that muscles could store memories of
how to do moves learned long ago. One student, Mark Workman, flew
down the mat with speed and grace, intimidating many of us. The
former wrestler, who refused to reveal his age, said he had learned
all his tricks here.</TE>
<TE>   "This class reminded me of being in third grade," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the class were newcomers. Jennifer Li, 29, had never
danced or done gymnastics. "It just looked like so much fun," said
the writing teacher.</TE>
<TE>   The tumbling portion of the class climaxed with front handsprings.
I couldn't believe that they were going to let people run down the
mat and try this without signing waiver forms. The first few people
seemed to be ex-gymnasts. Then people grew more timid, more real.</TE>
<TE>   One guy landed on his feet with a thud so jarring I was sure he
had broken a vertebra. But he just jogged back into line. When
another guy launched into his handstand, the spotters lifted him in
slo-mo, like a levitating magician's assistant, and carried him to an
upright landing position. The class erupted in applause. Now, that
was something that would never happen in an aerobics class. The cool
thing was that with the help of the spotters, you could get the
feeling of the move, even if there was no way on God's Earth that you
would ever be able to do it on your own.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes to go and, finally, the airborne portion of the
class began. We formed two lines before the trapeze and the rings.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the way I had imagined it--with a tiny platform up high
in a tent, a net stretched out far below, me swinging out into space,
my husband swinging out on a trapeze to meet me.</TE>
<TE>   Instead it was a trapeze attached from a normal ceiling. I'm tall,
so when I hung upside down, I could touch the floor with my hands.
Still, we were able to flip up onto the trapeze and swing there like
Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge." More advanced students did routines
tailored to their level.</TE>
<TE>   I flipped up onto the trapeze, arched forward like a swan,
balanced on my hipbones and grinned at myself, reflected back in a
hundred mirrors. I grabbed the ropes and swung up, my toes stretching
into the rafters, and flipped around to sit on the swing. One girl
swung by one hand like a real trapeze artist. It was just a class,
but the moves were arrestingly beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   The rings were hardest. We vibrated like springs with the effort
of holding ourselves. Again, with the help of a spotter, I flipped
around, put my ankles in the rings and curved around backward so I
formed an "O.''</TE>
<TE>   We did a quick cool-down. I glanced at my heart-rate monitor. In
an hour I had burned 96 calories and had barely crept into my target
heart-rate zone. I wished the class had gone longer. We'd barely
warmed up and begun to break down our fear barriers when the class
was over. Also, 15 people was too many. With 10 we would have kept
moving. While I definitely worked out my arm and shoulder muscles,
the class felt more appropriate as entertainment and toning after a
real workout. But in fun terms, the class was first rate.</TE>
<TE>   We all left giggling, with tales to tell and maybe, if we were
lucky, a few sore muscles as well.</TE>

<HD>Hungry? Blame a Hormone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The appetite-driving hormone ghrelin, which sounds a bit like the
word "gremlin," may well be the dietary devil responsible for those
late-night refrigerator raids and the irresistible pull of the office
snack cart.</LD>
<LD>   The word entered the popular diet vocabulary two weeks ago when a
study about it was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Research had shown not only that obese people who dieted had more
of the hormone in their blood (and subsequently regained weight) but
also that people who underwent gastric bypass surgery made barely any
ghrelin--and kept the pounds off.</LD>
<TE>   With the study receiving a blitz of attention, it's easy to jump
to the conclusion that if researchers could overpower or neutralize
ghrelin, they could achieve the Holy Grail of lasting weight loss.</TE>
<TE>   But such findings demand cool heads, weight loss experts say.
Every few years, we learn about another potential miracle
discovery--some other chemical that our bodies make that might be
harnessed to reverse weight gain.</TE>
<TE>   "These reports seem to come like meteorites: They crash through
the sky, and nothing comes in the short term. People come to lose
faith and lose confidence," said Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, a Columbia
University weight loss researcher. "People are desperate to find some
treatment. There are very few things that attract as much attention
as this: sex, body weight and fast cars."</TE>
<TE>   Leibel should know. Back in 1994, he headed one of the two
Rockefeller University laboratories that jointly cloned the gene for
leptin, a hormone manufactured mostly in the fat cells that tells the
brain it's time to go easy on the eating. It was the first hormone
found to regulate weight and appetite, and its discovery was a
watershed in obesity research, pushing researchers into nearly a
decade of what Leibel called "enormous advance and insights into the
regulation of body weight."</TE>
<TE>   Although hearts leaped at the early prospects of leptin, neither
it nor any of the other brain chemicals found to stimulate or
suppress appetite have yet led to good, long-term weight control.</TE>
<TE>   But ghrelin looks different to many researchers, in part because
it originates outside the brain, in the digestive system.</TE>
<TE>   Ghrelin is a chemical secreted by cells in the stomach and upper
part of the intestine, sending messages about food through the
bloodstream to the brain. Levels go up before a meal, telling you
it's time to chow down; they drop afterward, telling you it's time to
push back from the table.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to provide more biochemical evidence for why dieting
becomes such a Sisyphean struggle. In the recent study, obese people
who dropped excess pounds had more ghrelin in their blood than they
had before dieting, dooming them to regain what they'd lost. (No
wonder that the weight we "lose" we tend to "find" again. Our bodies
are programmed to lard up against winter starvation. Trouble is, in
modern times, we're plagued by the opposite problem, obesity).</TE>
<TE>   Ghrelin is a diet demon in another way too, said Dr. David E.
Cummings, lead author of the study published May 23. Not only does
the hormone increase appetite and eating, it decreases metabolism and
the breakdown of fat.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings, an endocrinologist at the Veterans Affairs Puget Health
Care System and the University of Washington, found that obese people
who underwent gastric bypass surgery had very little ghrelin in their
bloodstreams. Doctors had suspected these folks' ability to keep off
100 or more pounds stemmed from more than having their stomach
capacity reduced by 95% and their food rerouted so their intestines
absorbed fewer nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings' research suggests that the stomach's ghrelin-producing
cells somehow turn off after the surgery, cutting off the hunger
signal to a section of the hypothalamus in the brain called the
arcuate nucleus. Therefore, a logical strategy would be to find ways
to suppress ghrelin so that overweight patients could lose while
avoiding the risks of surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Obesity has surged to the top of the nation's public health
agenda, especially because it's a potent driver of diabetes, heart
disease and cancer. The pharmaceutical industry has spent billions of
dollars trying to deliver permanent weight loss in a pill: metabolism
speeder-uppers such as amphetamines, fat-blockers such as orlistat
(Xenical), appetite suppressants such as phentermine (half of the
banned fen-phen combination) and sibutramine (Meridia), which was
just in the news in May when a consumer group accused the
manufacturer of withholding information in at least seven users'
deaths. Cummings called ghrelin "an appealing target" for drug
makers, several of which had ghrelin studies under way before his
results came out. "It also doesn't take a lot of thought to realize a
cure for obesity would be the biggest cash cow any drug company has
ever seen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because ghrelin comes from outside the brain and travels in the
blood, it's potentially easier to manipulate with drugs than hormones
produced inside the brain, he said. Scientists could try giving
overweight people an antibody that would bind to ghrelin in the
bloodstream and stop it in its tracks, or they could try to develop
drugs that prevent ghrelin from communicating with its target brain
cells.</TE>
<TE>   Leibel predicted that Cummings' study will provoke additional
investigation into the so-called gut-brain connection. He said
there's considerable evidence that the gastroenterological tract
sends signals to other parts of the body, such as the liver and the
brain, and that several chemicals besides ghrelin probably are
involved. He cautioned that "there's a great difference between a
correlation" shown in Cummings' study and definitively showing
ghrelin to be the key hormone behind weight problems.</TE>
<TE>   Ghrelin first was discovered and named in 1999 by Japanese
researchers seeking ways to stimulate release of human growth
hormone. Scientists at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly reported in
October 2000 that ghrelin powerfully stimulated eating in rodents,
and that company continues to pursue ghrelin research.</TE>
<TE>   Merck's anti-obesity research also includes work with the cells
that ghrelin communicates with in the brain, said Janet Skidmore, a
Merck spokeswoman in Whitehouse Station, N.J. "We have a little
history, having discovered the [ghrelin] receptor," which is the
brain cell molecule that responds to ghrelin.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings thinks ghrelin may turn out to be most useful in boosting
the appetites of people who are wasting away. It could be given to
stimulate eating in people with anorexia, those losing weight because
of terminal illness or frail seniors who don't have much appetite.</TE>

<HD>About Kids and Sex</HD>
<DH>Many would recoil, but some scholars are urging more open
discussion of children's sexuality</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their theories are explosive, even subversive. They are also a very
hard sell, especially now, when the horror of predatory priests
rumbles ever louder.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, a handful of maverick writers and academics are
calling for a cultural revolution when it comes to children and sex.
They argue that we protect our children too much. They insist that
much of what we fear as "abuse" is actually healthy sexual
expression.</LD>
<LD>   They are kicking up quite a debate.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a visceral reaction when you bring this topic up," said
Harris Mirkin, a professor at the University of Missouri who has
written on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Added Judith Levine, author of a controversial new book on child
sexuality: "The minute you even suggest it's OK for kids to have
sexual pleasure in their lives, you're treading dangerous waters."</TE>
<TE>   Levine, Mirkin and other provocateurs start with the premise that
children of all ages are sexual beings with legitimate desires. They
argue, then, that kids should be free to seek out pleasure with
consenting peers. Some insist that adolescents should be free even to
experiment with adult partners.</TE>
<TE>   They acknowledge, of course, that abuse does exist, such as when
one party does not consent to the sexual relationship or when an
adult in a position of authority, such as a priest or teacher, uses
his or her status to gain the victim's trust. And they draw some age
distinctions, noting that though children can explore their sexuality
from babyhood on, pre-pubescent children should stop short of
intercourse.</TE>
<TE>   But overall, they insist we are too quick to see aggression,
molestation and outright deviance in healthy expressions of childhood
sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Why, they ask, do we assume it's exploitation when a 14-year-old
girl is intimate with a 23-year-old man? Why do we refer an
8-year-old boy to therapy if he's caught exploring a friend's
genitals? Why do we dismiss children's own explanations of such
acts--that they were mutual, that they were fun--as implausible, even
dangerous?</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are telling me they know the difference between
coercion and consent," Levine said. "I believe them."</TE>
<TE>   This is a tough time to be pushing such arguments.</TE>
<TE>   On top of the daily revelations about abusive priests, several
stories about student-teacher romances hit the headlines last month.
The Seattle student who, at age 12, got involved with teacher Mary
Kay Letourneau--fathering two children with her--lost a lawsuit he
brought against his former school district for failing to stop the
affair. A San Bernardino teacher who ran off to Las Vegas with a
15-year-old student she called her soul mate has been charged with
several counts of statutory sexual seduction.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even as they unsettle, these cases have served to bring child
sexuality up for discussion. And while many experts find the calls
for revolution alarming, some therapists and academics concede the
issues are worthy of debate.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've been talking about in academic circles for a decade
has been brought to public attention in a dramatic way," said Jorja
Prover, an adjunct professor at UCLA who specializes in child
sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "The priest scandal has changed the way people look at things.
They're realizing there's a difference between a priest abusing a
child and a 19-year-old having sex with a 14-year-old," Prover added.
"We can't have these absolutist views any more about what constitutes
abuse. We've got to look at [each case in] context."</TE>
<TE>   Yet that call for "context" strikes many as absurd. Adolescents
might want--or think they want--certain sexual experiences, critics
point out, but that doesn't mean they should be given free rein. It's
up to adults, they say, to define what's safe and appropriate--to set
limits, then enforce them.</TE>
<TE>   "As a society, we already do a notoriously bad job of observing
boundaries [in sexual behavior], whether it's professional therapists
getting involved with clients, employers getting involved with
employees, or priests abusing altar boys," said David Finkelhor, a
national authority on child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Those boundaries are important because they provide people with
protection, with guidance, with a sense of security," Finkelhor
argued. So it's important, he said, "to reinforce the norms" instead
of pushing to erode them.</TE>
<TE>   The lightning rod for this emerging discourse has been Levine's
book "Harmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children From Sex."
A freelance journalist, Levine has spent the last 20 years writing
about gender and family issues. Much of her book, especially the
section on sex education, has drawn praise from experts.</TE>
<TE>   But her central thesis--that children need more sexual
freedom--has proved radioactive. Critics have called the book "evil,"
"intolerable," and an "academic cover for molestation." Mirkin has
experienced similar backlash: This spring, Missouri lawmakers voted
to strip $100,000 from the state university's budget to urge that he
be fired for what one politician called his "illegal and morally
reprehensible views."</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, perhaps, the fury directed at these renegade
theorists has only pushed their ideas more forcefully into
circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Mirkin spent hours defending his views on talk radio last month.
And the first 3,500 copies of Levine's "Harmful to Minors" sold out
well before the official publication date of May 1. A second run of
10,000 has been ordered.</TE>
<TE>   That strikes some scholars as a victory in itself. "The fact that
[childhood sexuality] is being discussed in a sane and sober fashion
is a good first step," said Marjorie Heins, a 1st Amendment lawyer
who has studied the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In her book "Not in Front of the Children: Indecency, Censorship
and the Innocence of Youth," Heins argues that America has a
contradictory view of kids, making it tough to discuss their sex
lives rationally. "They're either the tender innocents who have to be
protected or the untamed libidos that need to be controlled," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Heins traces our jumbled attitudes about child sexuality to the
relatively recent development of the whole concept of adolescence.</TE>
<TE>   Until the early 20th century, Americans routinely went to work or
got married by age 13 or 14, often before the onset of puberty.
(Kansas and New Hampshire still have laws on the books permitting
girls as young as 12 or 13 to marry.)</TE>
<TE>   In this era, children were effectively on their own by the time
their bodies were mature enough for intercourse. That started to
change 70 or 80 years ago, as first the rich and later the working
class began to send their kids to secondary school, deferring their
independence. Now parents found themselves in charge of adolescents
with all-out libidos. For the first time, children's sexuality came
to be seen as a societal issue--to be both protected and controlled.</TE>
<TE>   Attitudes toward kids' sexual expression have shifted back and
forth ever since. And as views of child sexuality have evolved, so
too have definitions of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars trace the modern concept of sexual abuse to the 1970s,
when children's advocates began focusing on issues such as family
violence and parental neglect--and began turning up cases of incest
and molestation as well.</TE>
<TE>   The McMartin Preschool case in the mid-1980s threw the issue onto
the national radar, with frightening tales of satanic sex abuse at a
Manhattan Beach day care center. Charges against all but one teacher
were eventually dropped; that lone defendant, Ray Buckey, was
acquitted of 40 counts of abuse, and a jury deadlocked on the
remaining eight.</TE>
<TE>   Though the worst allegations were never proved, the case sparked a
child abuse panic as stories of sex-crazed adults began popping up
all over the country.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Levine writes, some therapists began raising an
alarm about children's sexual behavior with other children.</TE>
<TE>   Acts that once might have been passed off as normal
curiosity--such as toddlers "playing doctor" or siblings poking at
each other's "private parts"--came to be viewed as potentially
dangerous, even abusive, Levine argues. Therapy programs for juvenile
molesters were developed. Some kids who engaged in aggressive sexual
behavior with their classmates were prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   The drive to protect kids quickly swept beyond pre-pubescent
children.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Justice Department describes a "modern trend" of states
toughening statutory rape laws. A 16-year-old may testify that she
initiated intercourse with her 19-year-old boyfriend, but in much of
the country he can be prosecuted for statutory rape nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Mirkin argues that such laws reflect a "cultural construct" in
which children are framed as innocents, much as homosexuals were
framed as mentally ill in the 1950s. The dogma of the day, he writes,
becomes "an unquestioned moral principle," and anyone who dares to
dissent is dismissed as a dangerous quack.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a group that says, 'We know what the truth is, and we'll
call any discussion of the issue evil,'" Mirkin said.</TE>
<TE>   There are indeed some who worry that even discussing children's
sexual autonomy will erode our moral values. Others are perfectly
willing to have a discussion--but warn that the new social critics
are pushing way too far.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Levine writes approvingly of a Dutch law that
considers children as young as 12 capable of entering into sexual
relationships, even with adults. (Echoing language of many
pro-pedophile sites, she calls adult-child intimacy
"intergenerational sex" rather than statutory rape.)</TE>
<TE>   Many therapists do concede that adolescents can initiate and enjoy
sexual intimacy with adults. Some may even emerge unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most mainstream researchers question whether minors can
give meaningful consent to sex, especially with grown-ups--who are,
by definition, authority figures.</TE>
<TE>   "People who want adolescents to be sexual with them often say
there's informed consent," said sex therapist Dr. Gene Abel, who
treats pedophiles at his Behavioral Medicine Institute of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "But do they tell [the child], 'I would like to point out, if we
get found out, I may be charged with a sex crime and you may have to
testify in court about what we do sexually, and by the way, you may
also run the risk of sexually transmitted diseases'?" Abel said.</TE>
<TE>   And given the perpetually alarming statistics about teen
pregnancy, high school dropout rates, sexually transmitted diseases
and AIDS, the debate about what constitutes true "sexual abuse"
strikes many as irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   A 13-year-old girl may well see her relationship with a
22-year-old man as freedom, not exploitation--as salvation, not
victimization. But if she gets pregnant, if her boyfriend splits, if
she winds up an eighth-grade dropout on welfare, semantics is beside
the point.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether we call it sexual abuse or not, this is still part of a
serious societal problem," says Finkelhor, who directs the Crimes
Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   Levine's response is to call for all children to get a "sensuality
education."</TE>
<TE>   She wants schools to teach reproduction, contraception and the
dangers of unprotected sex. She also wants students to learn that
their desires are natural, to understand there are many ways to find
pleasure in sexual expression.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just say, 'Go out there, kids, and have sex with whoever
you want.' We have to prepare kids to know their bodies, to
understand what their responsibilities and limitations are," Levine
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to walk a fine line," she added, "between our obligation
as adults to protect our kids from harm and our obligation to respect
them as autonomous people with their own sexual desires and their own
sexual lives."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With church scandals, Internet porn and teenage romance, sex
education could be one of the most wide-ranging and important
subjects taught in middle and high school, some child psychologists
say. Yet for better or worse, most of the nation's sex-ed classes
focus on a handful of subjects--including anatomy, abstinence,
AIDS--and offer little guidance to boys and girls trying to cope with
a host of physical and emotional changes.</LD>
<LD>   Though approaches vary from school to school, most start with what
some educators call "fifth-grade plumbing," a quick explanation of
where babies come from, said Tamara Kreinin, president of the
Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, a
New York-based nonprofit organization that works with schools and
parents. In middle school and beyond, Kreinin said, many students get
a smattering of courses, some on sexually transmitted diseases,
others on the importance of avoiding sex. "Sometimes the course
amounts to being shown an hourlong movie, without any discussion
afterward," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Many teachers shy away from edgier topics such as sexual abuse,
harassment and date rape--or how, for example, a 13-year-old might
handle sexual involvement with someone 10 years older. "Teachers will
tell you, 'We wouldn't touch those subjects with a 10-foot pole; the
parents would go nuts,'" said Sal Chiariello, who runs an innovative
sex and development education program in Rockland County, N.Y., for
kindergarten through 12th grade. "There's a lot of apprehension when
it comes to this stuff. Teachers are worried about losing tenure, the
administrators are afraid of the parents, and parents fear for what
their kids might be learning."</TE>
<TE>   In this environment, a discussion of sexuality or relationships
with older peers or adults would probably be disastrous, he said.
"Even in 12th grade, there are kids with very mature bodies who have
no concept of consent ... and believe me, in a large high school with
thousands of kids, there are going to be some predators who are
watching to see which ones are vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   For now, administrators say, political debate over whether to
teach contraception has precluded many educators from including the
topics teenagers most want to learn about--such as how to manage
erotic urges, relationships and pressure to have sex. "Right now,
we're having an argument over whether we should even mention condoms
in the classroom," said Tina Hoff, vice president at the Kaiser
Family Foundation, a nonprofit health research group in Menlo Park,
Calif. "We're not even close to a discussion about giving kids skills
to negotiate whether or not to have sex."</TE>
<TE>   That's as it should be, millions of parents say: Schools have no
place giving advice about sexual behavior, beyond describing the
benefits of abstinence. Some policymakers agree. In recent years, the
federal government has set aside some $400 million to support
programs that teach abstinence until marriage. Nationwide, about 34%
of high schools teach abstinence-only curricula, downplaying or
omitting discussion of contraception, according to a 1999 Kaiser
Foundation survey. Another 58% of schools in the survey reported
teaching comprehensive courses, which include discussions of
contraception.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what they want their kids to learn in sex education,
parents are generally more demanding than teachers. In a 2000 Kaiser
survey, more than eight in 10 parents of teenagers nationwide said
schools should teach students how to use condoms, as well as other
contraceptives, and how to talk about protection with partners. About
three-quarters said that sex-ed classes should discuss sexual
orientation and abortion. Almost all of the parents surveyed wanted
schools to help their kids handle the pressure to have sex, and the
emotional consequences of becoming sexually active.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents themselves sure aren't doing it," said Hoff. "So many
kids are getting their sex education from other sources, from the
media, from the WB network and MTV. I think even network executives
would agree those aren't the best sources."</TE>
<TE>   California requires school districts to cover a number of topics
related to sex, including contraception and pregnancy. Students
typically get two to five weeks of classes, first in the seventh
grade, and again in 10th grade, said Ric Loya, of the HIV/AIDS
prevention unit of the Los Angeles Unified School District. "These
are the highest-attended classes of the year," said Loya. "The kids
are just packed in, even if the teacher is boring."</TE>
<TE>   Though most teachers stick closely to the curriculum, Loya said,
all get questions from students on everything from how to recognize
sexual advances to how to handle their boyfriend's moods. "Sometimes
they raise their hand in class, sometimes they'll come up to you
afterward, but that's how many things are handled--informally," he
said.</TE>

<HD>The Problem With 'Consent'</HD>
<DH>Voices* At the time they may have felt grown up, but
youngsters who had sexual encounters with adults look back with mixed
emotions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christine thought she had it good.</LD>
<LD>   She was 13, just going into ninth grade, and no boy had ever so
much as flirted with her. Then this man walked up to her, smiling, as
she hung out with her friends on a Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   He was 23.</LD>
<TE>   He talked with her. He teased. Soon they were kissing. And then
doing more than that.</TE>
<TE>   Christine felt proud to have hooked such an experienced boyfriend.
Her friends thought it was cool. Moving so fast into sex bothered her
a little. But then again, she didn't want to stop. It was fun. Or at
least she knew it should be fun. "He taught me just about
everything," she said. "I didn't want to know everything. Well, I
did. But I didn't really. I don't know. I was 13."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, she would have called the sex consensual. Three years
later, she calls it statutory rape.</TE>
<TE>   Christine's voice echoes loud in the debate about child sexuality
because it helps illuminate the knotty issue of consent.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of giving children more sexual freedom insist that most
can handle it. They argue that if an adolescent girl says she wants
sex, she's expressing a very natural desire--and should be free to
act on it. If she chooses to get intimate with an adult, why should
society care?</TE>
<TE>   That's the argument Christine would have made at 13.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so self-righteous," she said. "I kept saying that age
doesn't make any difference."</TE>
<TE>   Yet she recognizes now--after two years of therapy--that even as
she was proclaiming herself in love, she was turning to drugs and
alcohol to hide a deepening despair. Consent was starting to feel
like coercion.</TE>
<TE>   After four months, she found the courage to break off the
relationship. But she still hasn't recovered. "Whenever I look back
at the things that happened," she said, "I feel dirty and guilty."</TE>
<TE>   Many others who have lived through such relationships could tell
similar stories. They speak of their sexual initiation as a time of
inner turmoil, when they thought they knew what they wanted--but,
then again, weren't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   Such confusion is often magnified by the messages teens get from
friends and the media: Sex is grown-up, it's liberating, it's
rebellious. Getting swept away by passion is supposed to be a thrill,
every adolescent's fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially for males, any sexual contact you have, it's
considered that you 'got lucky,'" said Scott Abraham, who at 15 was
seduced by a flirtatious neighbor twice his age.</TE>
<TE>   Sex with the neighbor "felt horrible," he said, "but I knew it was
supposed to feel good." Too proud--or too scared--to consider himself
a victim, he went back to her house several times for furtive trysts.</TE>
<TE>   Now 49, studying for a master's in psychology, Abraham realizes
the affair tore at his self-esteem and twisted his interactions with
women for years. He has no hesitation now calling the seduction
abuse. As he put it: "These relationships are predatory."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. But are they always harmful? James, another "victim,"
would say no.</TE>
<TE>   He was 9, proudly pedaling his new bike, when he met Matthew, the
18-year-old mechanic who would become his lover. Matthew complimented
James on the bike. He invited him over to look at some motorcycles. A
friendship bloomed.</TE>
<TE>   The two spent hours playing Atari, Matthew nuzzling James on the
ear. They walked in the park. They tinkered with motorcycles.</TE>
<TE>   "The sexual aspect just happened," James said. "It was a mutual
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   James is now 22 and engaged to be married. Recalling his
three-year relationship with Matthew, he understands that, while he
"felt powerful" at the time, he was not the one in control.</TE>
<TE>   He also recognizes that he did not give the kind of "informed
consent" that psychologists say is vital.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he gets angry at the notion that he was used or abused. He
says he knew what he was doing with Matthew--and he wanted absolutely
to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder why people can't just accept that I am happy with it,"
he asks, "and that I am not psychologically scarred?"</TE>
<TE>   Many therapists do accept that some kids who might be considered
victims of sexual abuse suffer no lasting harm--and may even look
back at the experience with fondness and gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, they cannot endorse the permissive approach to child
sexuality that some emerging scholarship is pushing. For one thing,
too many kids do get hurt. Then, there's a basic question of
morality.</TE>
<TE>   Some of what we call sexual abuse "is not inevitably damaging,"
said Dr. Fred Berlin, who runs a clinic for sexual disorders at Johns
Hopkins University. Children "may even have enjoyed the experience,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But to me," Berlin added, voice resolute, "it is always wrong."</TE>

<HD>Irregular Periods Linked to Bone Loss</HD>
<DH>Women* The absence of a regular menstrual cycle at any age
for three months or longer could warn of osteoporosis later in life,
researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Menstrual irregularities are not usually taken seriously by women or
doctors. But such disruptions could lead to bone loss--and eventual
osteoporosis, researchers have found.</LD>
<LD>   While many people think that bone loss occurs after menopause,
when the ovaries have stopped working due to age, researchers now
believe that disruption of the ovaries' function at any age has a
direct effect on bones.</LD>
<LD>   Lengthy menstrual cycle disruptions may even serve as a predictor
for who will develop osteoporosis later in life.</LD>
<TE>   "The menstrual cycle doesn't get the respect that it deserves,"
says Dr. Lawrence M. Nelson, lead author of a study published in the
May issue of the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. "The ovary
doesn't get respect as a gland that makes hormones. Most women think
of the ovary as a reproductive gland. But the ovary helps keep your
bones healthy."</TE>
<TE>   A growing body of evidence suggests that the absence of a regular
menstrual cycle for three months or longer--a condition called
amenorrhea--should be evaluated by a physician in order to address
the underlying cause of the condition and to prevent bone loss,
Nelson says.</TE>
<TE>   "If you haven't had a period for three months, you should have it
checked out," says Nelson, a researcher at the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development's unit on gynecologic
endocrinology. "Bone density is like your bank account. You have to
keep your bones healthy when you're young to keep them healthy in
their older years."</TE>
<TE>   Bone is built in childhood and adolescence and remains stable
until the late 30s or early 40s.</TE>
<TE>   Bone mass then gradually declines, with the most losses in women
occurring during the years just after menopause.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, which is when bone
becomes so porous that the risk of fracture is high.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, Nelson and his colleagues studied 48 women, ages 18
to 40, with a condition called premature ovarian failure.</TE>
<TE>   The disorder occurs when the ovaries stop producing eggs and
reproductive hormones well in advance of natural menopause.</TE>
<TE>   They found that even when amenorrhea was present, often neither
the women nor their doctors expressed concern over the menstrual
disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of these women were college graduates, and
one-third of them had graduate degrees," says Nelson. "But over half
of them did not view missing menstrual periods as an important health
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the women experienced five years of menstrual
irregularities and saw at least three doctors before premature
ovarian failure was diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   "If no one figures out your ovaries aren't working right for five
years, you can be losing bone density over that time," he says.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how much bone loss can occur with menstrual
irregularities or if that bone loss can be replenished.</TE>
<TE>   Previous studies have shown young women with anorexia nervosa have
a higher risk of bone fracture.</TE>
<TE>   And an earlier NICHD study of 89 women with premature ovarian
failure found that 67% of the women already had signs of osteopenia,
a low bone-density condition that precedes osteoporosis.</TE>
<TE>   Although menstrual irregularities are often present, many women
with premature ovarian failure, which affects about 1% of women,
discover they have the condition only when they seek treatment for
infertility.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a more significant social issue now that women are delaying
their childbearing," Nelson says. "If you are delaying childbearing
to age 35, ovarian failure at age 30 is a big problem."</TE>
<TE>   Premature ovarian failure is not the only condition that causes a
shortage of hormones produced by the ovaries, thereby affecting bone
health.</TE>
<TE>   Young women can develop amenorrhea because of eating disorders,
excessive exercise or stress and pituitary gland tumors.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the cause, the loss of hormones appears to significantly
affect bones--perhaps by interrupting the bone-building process that
occurs in the first two to three decades of life, Nelson says.</TE>
<TE>   "Less than optimal development of bone density during adolescence
and young adulthood is as important as later bone loss in the
development of osteoporosis," the authors state.</TE>
<TE>   Inadequate hormone levels could cause other problems as well, says
Diana Taylor, an associate professor of nursing at UC San Francisco
and a member of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research.</TE>
<TE>   "There are estrogen receptors throughout the body," she says. "So
the loss of estrogen not only affects bones, it could affect other
physiological and psychological systems."</TE>
<TE>   The new study, says Taylor, is further evidence that "we need to
help women learn to keep track of their menstrual cycle, and train
doctors and nurses to monitor it as part of the health exam."</TE>
<TE>   Adolescent girls often have irregular menstrual cycles for a year
or two after starting their periods.</TE>
<TE>   But after that initial year or two, any disruptions of three
months or longer is not normal, Nelson says.</TE>
<TE>   About 3% of young women experience amenorrhea each year. Some of
the conditions linked to amenorrhea can be treated to restore normal
ovarian function, or replacement hormones can be given to prevent
bone loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on a campaign to get the menstrual cycle recognized as a
vital sign," Nelson says. "Women should be asked, 'When was your last
menstrual period, and are your periods regular?'"</TE>

<HD>Lack of Nurses Blamed for More Deaths</HD>
<DH>Mortality* A major study shows concrete effects of the
shortage: a higher casualty rate among patients and more health
complications.</DH>

<LD>The nursing shortage afflicting the nation's hospitals has resulted
in increased deaths and illnesses of patients from heart attacks,
infection, shock and internal bleeding, according to a new study.</LD>
<LD>   The article in last week's New England Journal of Medicine by
Harvard researcher Jack Needleman is the first major study to
document, on a national scale, the damage to patient health caused by
inadequate nursing staff levels.</LD>
<LD>   "The problem of low nurse staffing is serious at many hospitals,
and its consequences for patients can be severe," said Needleman, an
assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, who
worked with four colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   The decreasing popularity of the nursing profession has resulted
in an estimated 126,000 vacancies at U.S. hospitals, about 13% of the
average medical center's nursing staff.</TE>
<TE>   The federally funded study by Needleman and colleagues shows the
concrete impact on patient health, said Deborah Dang, director of
nursing at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "This study speaks to the real contribution of nurses in
acute-care settings," said Dang. "Nurses make a real difference in
how patients fare." Dang said nurses work as an "early warning
system" to detect health problems that arise in patients during their
hospitalization. If there aren't enough nurses around to recognize
the early signs of infection, shock or heart attack, for example,
doctors might not be able to prevent death.</TE>
<TE>   In their study, Needleman and colleagues analyzed data from 799
hospitals in 11 states nationally. They concluded:</TE>
<TE>   * Patients suffer cardiac arrest and shock 9.4% less often in
hospitals with high staff levels (one nurse for every 2.5 patients
per day) than low staff levels (one nurse for every four patients).</TE>
<TE>   * People cared for in hospitals with high nursing staff levels
also suffer 9% fewer urinary tract infections, 5% fewer episodes of
bleeding in their stomachs or intestines and 6.4% less
hospital-acquired pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   * Surgical patients in hospitals with high nursing staff levels
are 6% less likely to die from complications of surgery.</TE>
<TE>   * Patients in medical centers with high nursing staff levels
recover more quickly, spending an average of four hours less in the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, the shift to managed care and cost
containment have reduced the nursing staffs of hospitals and fuelled
burnout among employees, experts say. Mandatory overtime and
relatively static pay have also made the job less appealing.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, more women are discovering higher-paid
alternatives to this traditionally female occupation, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Steinbrook, a deputy editor at the New England Journal
of Medicine, wrote in an article accompanying Needleman's study that
one barrier to recruiting more nurses is that physicians often fail
to treat them with enough respect.</TE>
<TE>   "The perception is that physicians and hospital administrators
often treat registered nurses as workers, not as clinicians and
peers, and when possible seek to replace them with less skilled and
cheaper personnel," Steinbrook wrote.</TE>

<HD>Post-9/11 in NYC, More Drinking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One way to track the emotional impact of a national disaster,
psychologists have found, is to follow alcohol and tobacco
usage--and, by that measure, the attacks of Sept. 11 had a profound
effect on New York City residents.</LD>
<LD>   During the second month after the attack, researchers interviewed
988 adults living in Manhattan, asking how much they were smoking and
drinking compared with the first week of September. About 25% of
those surveyed said they were drinking more than usual, about 10%
were lighting up more frequently and 3% were smoking more marijuana
than they had before the attack. The study was published in
Saturday's American Journal of Epidemiology.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this gives us the first clear idea to what extent entire
community was affected, not just rescue workers and victims'
families," said lead author David Vlahov, director of the center for
urban epidemiological studies at the New York Academy of Medicine, a
public health nonprofit organization..</LD>
<TE>   The numbers echo results from a Gallup poll after the 1995
Oklahoma City bombing. Compared with the people in Indiana, smokers
and drinkers in Oklahoma City were twice as likely to drink and smoke
more after the bombing. The Academy of Medicine survey was remarkably
sensitive to location. People living below 14th Street, on the same
side of the city as the World Trade Center towers, were twice as
likely as those living above the street to increase their drinking or
smoking, Vlahov said. That 14th Street also marked the security zone
border around the downtown area, researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they weren't directly in danger, people living in that
area certainly felt part of the war zone, so to speak, and would have
felt violated," said Dr. Fred Gusman, education division director of
the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Palo Alto.</TE>

<LD>Question: I'm a 15-year-old female who is in desperate need of your
help. Although I'm thin (5 feet, 7 inches tall and 118 pounds),
lately I've been having a problem with cellulite on my thighs and
stomach. I've become extremely depressed about this, and I'm
wondering if there is any workout or anything to help me.</LD>
<LD>   ASHLEY</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Cellulite, which produces a dimpling effect on our skin,
can be difficult to erase.</TE>
<TE>   To diminish these deposits, you need to burn more calories through
proper diet and exercise. Try to fit in at least four cardiovascular
workouts each week, at least 30 minutes each time. Exercise within
your target heart-rate range to ensure sufficient intensity. And
definitely add weightlifting to your routine; it's a great way to
build muscle, shape your body and burn calories--which reduces fat
and cellulite. You should notice a difference after three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be suckered into ads promoting lotions and pills for
cellulite removal. These drugs won't help--and could be harmful.</TE>

<LD>   Background: The Epilepsy Foundation is a national nonprofit group
that since 1968 has been assisting the 2.3 million children and
adults who suffer from epileptic seizures. The site provides visitors
with explanations, advice and contacts for various services,
including support groups.</LD>
<TE>   What Works: The people behind this site know what it means to live
with the threat of a seizure. The site has advice for parents,
baby-sitters and teachers of children with epilepsy, and for those
who suffer uncontrollable fits and are worried about driving,
starting a new job, or how the affliction will play out at school.
This is not the place to learn about the science of seizures; The
discussion of what's happening inside the brain are superficial. At
the same time, the foundation provides useful information about
seizure medications, as well as a list of ongoing clinical trials.</TE>

<HD>Health Experts Seek Extra Step Against Teen Smoking</HD>
<DH>Tobacco* In California, at the urging of a doctors group, a
bill is in the works to raise to 21 the legal minimum age to buy
cigarettes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fewer teenagers smoke than at any time in the past decade, but health
authorities aren't satisfied. They want to reach the 28% of high
school students who continue to light up.</LD>
<LD>   The ideas include creating anti-smoking campaigns for particular
ethnic groups, increasing cigarette taxes, and, in possibly the most
intriguing proposal, raising the legal age to 21 for purchasing
cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood) planned to announce
today that he is introducing legislation (AB 1453) to make 21 the
legal age for purchasing tobacco products in California.</LD>
<TE>   Koretz took up sponsorship of the bill at the urging of the
California Medical Assn., which earlier this year proposed raising
the legal age.</TE>
<TE>   "California has led the way in anti-smoking measures, and my bill
is the next step in reducing teenage smoking," says Koretz, who adds:
"I know I will face great opposition in trying to pass this
legislation."</TE>
<TE>   But novel approaches may be needed to further reduce teen smoking
rates, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working against an industry that spends a million and a
half dollars a day in California to promote its products, and young
people are the target," says Dr. Alan Henderson, past president of
the state branch of the American Cancer Society.</TE>
<TE>   A National Cancer Institute report released in April said more
research should be devoted to understanding why teen smoking rates
remain higher than average in certain groups, such as white female
adolescents.</TE>
<TE>   The report also suggested that, because teens are so sensitive to
cigarette price increases, raising taxes on tobacco products could
have a major impact on youth smoking. That idea has drawn broad
support from such prominent health groups as the American Lung Assn.
and the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts are also underway nationwide to strengthen laws barring
sales to minors and cigarette advertising aimed at them. But it's in
California that the tobacco-control movement has been taken one step
further, with the proposal to increase the legal age for purchasing
tobacco products from 18 to 21.</TE>
<TE>   All but three states allow tobacco purchases at age 18. The legal
age is 19 in Alaska, Alabama and Utah. And while the majority of
health experts say they believe that raising the legal age would
significantly curb youth smoking, the proposal stands little chance
of becoming law.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is enough evidence to know there would be a real
public health benefit to raising the legal age," says Matthew Myers,
president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a nonprofit group in
Washington, D.C. "What we don't know is whether this would be
politically acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, how the legal-age debate plays out in California may
reflect the strength and direction of the anti-tobacco movement
nationwide, he said."People will be watching California, more to
determine how far we've moved, politically and culturally, on
smoking," says Myers. "People want to know: Is this an issue whose
time has come?"</TE>
<TE>   Raising the legal age to 21 is the best way to cut teen smoking
rates, says Dr. Leonard Klay, a Santa Rosa obstetrician who proposed
the idea at the California Medical Assn.'s annual meeting in
February. Numerous studies show that most people begin smoking before
18. A federal study in 1991, for example, found that the average age
for first trying a cigarette was 141/2 and that 71% of smokers said
they were daily smokers prior to 19.</TE>
<TE>   Studies also show that people who don't take up smoking by age 21
are highly unlikely ever to become addicted to nicotine.</TE>
<TE>   But ongoing efforts urging retailers to ask for identification
from young people seeking to purchase cigarettes have been only
marginally successful. Studies show it becomes progressively easier
for teens to buy cigarettes the closer they are to 18.</TE>
<TE>   A legal age of 21 would "almost certainly raise the average age at
which a store will sell cigarettes to young people," says Richard
Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University School of Law in
Boston, who has studied the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence is that store [clerks] will, by and large, not sell
cigarettes to a 14-year-old but they will sell to a 16- or
17-year-old," he says. "Raising the legal age to 21 might push back
that cutoff point to 19 or 20. And that would be a very important
achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Health groups in the state, however, seem to favor less-radical
tactics that have more proof of effectiveness--such as an increase in
tobacco taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The California branch of the American Cancer Society has no
position on the age-limit proposal, says the ACS' Henderson, a
professor of health sciences at Cal State Long Beach. The only single
approach that definitely changes teen smoking habits is raising the
tobacco tax, he says.</TE>
<TE>   State health groups, in fact, have enthusiastically endorsed
legislation--Senate Bill 1890--that would raise cigarette taxes in
the state by 65 cents a pack. The recent National Cancer Institute
report on teen smoking notes that a 10% increase in the price of
cigarettes is predicted to reduce youth smoking by at least 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the California division of the American Lung Assn. have
also questioned the effectiveness of the age-21 proposal in
comparison to other approaches to reduce teen smoking.</TE>
<TE>   "In concept we support the idea of raising the minimum age," says
Paul Knappath, vice president of government relations for the
California ALA. "What we'd be looking for is what impact it would
have on existing efforts to enforce laws on tobacco sales to youth."</TE>
<TE>   Knappath notes there have been laws banning sales to youth for 100
years but enforcement of those laws has fallen short.</TE>
<TE>   "We still haven't been able to eliminate illegal sales to minors,"
he says. "So we support efforts to enforce the laws we already have
on the books."</TE>
<TE>   Even the tobacco industry appears unthreatened by the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not something we would be involved with," says Tom Ryan,
a spokesman for cigarette-maker Philip Morris Cos. "It's a societal
issue to determine what the minimum age should be to purchase tobacco
products."</TE>

<HD>Some Foods Can Give Women Relief From Endometriosis</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Endometriosis is a chronic disease that affects one out of 10 women
of childbearing age in the United States, causing such symptoms as
intense pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue and
infertility.</LD>
<LD>   Every month, the endometrium--the lining of the uterus--thickens
with blood in response to rising levels of the hormone estrogen. If
conception does not occur, the body sheds this lining during the
normal menstrual bleed.</LD>
<LD>   In endometriosis, bits of the endometrium move out of the uterus
and embed themselves in the nearby tissues of the ovaries,
intestines, bladder, vagina, cervix or bowel. Although no longer in
the uterus, these stray cells still respond to higher levels of
estrogen by amassing blood. Because this extra blood has nowhere to
be released, the cells develop into thickened cysts and adhesions,
which cause the symptoms of endometriosis.</LD>
<TE>   A doctor can determine the location, size and extent of the
problem and help sufferers decide on a treatment program. The
Endometriosis Assn., a nonprofit self-help organization based in
Milwaukee, reports that dietary changes also can help many women find
considerable relief from their symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing consumption of soy-based foods is a good place to
start. Soybeans, soy milk, soy yogurt and tofu are all rich in plant
estrogens; so too are lentils, bean sprouts, whole-wheat cereals and
linseeds.</TE>
<TE>   Plant estrogens dampen the effect of human estrogen and, in so
doing, may reduce the amount of blood collecting in stray endometrial
cells and lessen symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Sipping ginger tea may help women suffering from nausea, because
the volatile oils in ginger can calm queasy stomachs. Chamomile and
peppermint tea can also soothe the stomach and reduce intestinal
cramping.</TE>
<TE>   It is crucial for women who experience either diarrhea or
constipation to drink at least eight cups of water daily. For those
with diarrhea, this prevents dehydration, and for those with
constipation, it can soften the stools, making them easier to pass.
In both instances, eating pro-biotic bacteria such as acidophilus and
bifidus (found in yogurt and yogurt drinks) can help restore normal
colon activity.</TE>
<TE>   The exhaustion often associated with endometriosis can itself lead
to further problems, triggering a weakened immunity, ongoing
infections, stress and anxiety. Red meat, dark poultry meat, oily
fish like sardines and sesame seeds are good sources of iron, which
is needed to fight fatigue, and fruits and vegetables provide
immune-boosting vitamin C.</TE>
<TE>   Vitamin C also promotes healing of damaged tissues, while oily
fish provide the body with omega-3 oils, which may help reduce and
control inflammation around the affected areas.</TE>
<TE>   Certain supplements may prove effective to some women battling
endometriosis.</TE>
<TE>   Chaste berry and black cohosh can help correct hormonal imbalances
that otherwise intensify the pain of the disorder.</TE>
<TE>   And the minerals calcium and magnesium seem to lower levels of
prostaglandins--hormone-like substances that exacerbate menstrual
cramps.</TE>
<TE>   Women who want more of these minerals can take, respectively,
500-milligram and 250-milligram supplements throughout the menstrual
cycle or consume foods such as nonfat milk, sesame seeds, dark green
vegetables, dried figs and tofu, all of which are good dietary
sources.</TE>

<HD>His Loyalty Will Never Secede From Hollywood</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Grant is a jolly old elf with the kind of explosive enthusiasm
that makes palms sway and windows rattle.</LD>
<LD>   He's the quintessential Hollywoodian, the dean of boosters, the
honorary mayor of a town that has gone through more phases than Liz
Taylor's love life.</LD>
<LD>   No face is more familiar, no smile more enduring than Grant's in a
community he adopted as his own more than half a century ago.</LD>
<TE>   It was a Mickey Rooney movie, "Boys Town," that inspired him to
come to Hollywood from the North Carolina farming city of Goldsboro,
a star-struck boy who even looked a little like his early idol.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to myself, if that little twerp can do it," Grant says
with a flourish, "then so can I!"</TE>
<TE>   He laughs with the same vitality that characterizes his hip-hooray
spirit during lunch at Musso &amp; Frank, one of the few institutions
more durable than the 79-year-old herald of Hollywood. Grant calls
the place City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   He first saw the town of his dreams in 1943 as a soldier passing
through. He remembered that actor Chester Morris, who'd been to
Goldsboro on a USO tour, had said to him, "If you're ever in
Hollywood call me," so he did.</TE>
<TE>   It was Grant's first association with a celebrity. Now the list of
stars whose personal telephone numbers he possesses is at about
1,500. The list of those he knows is probably in the thousands.</TE>
<TE>   He has his own star on the Walk of Fame, both a building and a
street named after him and more awards and medals than a Russian
general. Director Ron Howard calls him "the heart and soul of
Hollywood," and I don't know anyone who doubts that.</TE>
<TE>   I come from a long line of dour, predatory trolls, and to meet an
elf with such boundless enthusiasm is a shock to the system. He is my
emotional opposite in terms of finding good in the world that
surrounds us. He is yang to my yin, a bundle of positive energy to my
low hum of doubt. The man whistles while he works.</TE>
<TE>   Grant loves Hollywood the way a boy loves his puppy, openly and
unconditionally. And he'll keep on loving it even if breaks away from
L.A. "I was born to be here," he says, peering out at the world
through round, silver-rimmed glasses. And he means it.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he's all sizzle and no steak. He's been busier than a
five-legged cat over the years, raising funds to refurbish the
Hollywood sign, revitalizing the Walk of Fame and the Santa Claus
Lane Parade, working for a Hollywood postage stamp and successfully
lobbying for a subway through town, among other projects.</TE>
<TE>   He's been a stunt car driver, a disc jockey, a television
producer, a game show host, an actor, a sportscaster, an emcee at
about 5,000 events and the presiding chairman over 553 star
placements on the Walk of Fame. Grant has become more synonymous with
Hollywood than either Marilyn Monroe or Mickey Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   A recent achievement has been his support for the new Hollywood &amp;
Highland shopping center, a complex of restaurants, shops, movie
house and theaters that is supposed to herald Hollywood's new
beginning. There've been other new beginnings, but they've dissolved
in disappointment. Grant still, however, foresees a Hollywood
Boulevard turned into a walking street with mimes and strolling
musicians, peopled by families rather than freaks. He urges patience.
"We've developed a fast-food mentality," he once wrote. "We expect
our entire menu to be delivered in 30 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   "The whole city is show biz and I'm a showman," Grant exclaims,
his laughter floating over the corned beef sandwiches and dry
martinis of the patrons around us. "People just don't understand the
place. I believe in Hollywood. I'll never give up on it."</TE>
<TE>   When he first came to town, one could see celebrities on the
streets or at restaurants. Now they're in Malibu or Denver or New
York or on a farm somewhere in Connecticut. Not only are there fewer
celebrities around, Grant says, "We don't even have the best souvenir
shops anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Developers and urban renewal experts hedge their bets when it
comes to predicting the area's comeback from sleaze to the kind of
place that Grant envisions. It's getting there, but it'll take years
for the community to return to anything equaling its heyday. A
secession from L.A. could also obscure its future.</TE>
<TE>   But there's not a lot of room for pessimism in the heart of the
jolly old elf from Goldsboro. He sees magic in the future, the way
movies produce magic, with a Hollywood ending in an environment
grander than any computerized version. But he's not going to sit
around waiting for it.</TE>
<TE>   There are star placements to host, parades to lead and ceremonies
ad infinitum to plan and produce. All of this while preparing for a
trip to Afghanistan for his 56th overseas tour to entertain our
troops. Grant is more unique than any honor can describe, more
kinetic, more positive, more excited, more visionary, more ... well
... Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Such energy I've never seen. As he crossed the parking lot to his
shiny new Infiniti Q45, I swear to you he bounced. What a guy.</TE>

<HD>During Fertile Days, Women Are on the Prowl, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last decade, the scientific community has investigated how a
woman's ovulation--which is concealed, cryptic and undetectable
unlike that in most other animals--influences her behavior and, by
extension, that of her partner. In the latest volley of research, it
appears that when a woman is in the fertile phase of her menstrual
cycle, she is most likely to find other men sexually alluring and to
fantasize about men other than her spouse or lover. Men, in turn,
appear to sense their women's surging sexual urges. As a woman's eye
wanders, her man may send flowers, call to see if she is really where
she said she would be, try to occupy her time and grow more
attentive.</LD>
<LD>   The University of New Mexico researchers who conducted the study,
which appears in the current issue of the journal Proceedings:
Biological Sciences, have hypothesized that these modern-day
reproductive urges and strategies are left over from the mating
rituals of our ancient ancestors. Women, they theorize, may be
scanning the gene pool for the Superman of genetic health in hopes of
bearing the most robust offspring. At the same time, these women's
mates are working to fortify bonds to ward off sexual interlopers.</LD>
<TE>   Fifty-one women from 18 to 34 years old filled out questionnaires
concerning their sexual desires, their behavior and their partners'
behavior during the high-fertility phase of their cycle (five to
seven days before ovulation) and once during the low-fertility phase
of their cycle. Ovulation detection kits were used to determine the
phases. The women were asked how much they had engaged in each of 35
behaviors or feelings in the previous two days on a four-point scale.
The questionnaire asked about strong sexual attraction to the primary
partner, sexual arousal by the sight of someone very physically
attractive other than the primary partner, flirting with someone
other than a current partner and sexual activity.</TE>
<TE>   "Women did not fantasize about their primary mate any more during
the high-fertility phase of their cycle than during other times in
their cycle," said Steven Gangestad, professor of psychology at
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, lead author of the study.
"But there was a 60% to 85% increase in women's ratings for
attraction to and fantasies about people other than their partner in
their high-fertility phase.... We don't know if this happens for all
women."</TE>
<TE>   The jump in fantasies about men other than a current lover
"impressively supports our hypothesis" that women in their highest
stage of fertility are shopping around for the best genetic benefits
for their potential offspring, said Christine Garver, a University of
New Mexico doctoral student in psychology and co-author of the study.
"The results indicate that maybe ovulation may not be completely
concealed. It would be nice to know exactly how the mechanism works
but we don't." Strangely, the women reported that while they felt
more sexual in their fertile phase and initiated sex more often with
their primary partner, they did not feel more sexual interest in him.</TE>
<TE>   "Women have reported having greater sexual desire during ovulation
for the last 30 years," said Gangestad. "Women feel more sexual and
it appears that they find themselves attracted to men other than
their partner but they are not necessarily going to pursue it."</TE>
<TE>   To determine whether men changed their behavior during their
partner's fertile period, 27 of the women filled out a questionnaire
about their primary partner's behavior. The most dramatic and complex
results had to do with vigilance or, in the parlance of evolutionary
psychology, "mate guarding" behavior. Women reported that their men
were more attentive, called or checked up on them unexpectedly,
looked through their personal belongings, tried to monopolize their
time and were motivated to please them. Women in nonexclusive
relationships indicated that their partners were particularly
vigilant in their high-fertility phase.</TE>
<TE>   But just what behavioral or biological cues men are responding to
is unclear. Gangestad, who with University of New Mexico psychologist
Randy Thornhill has studied how women's menstrual cycles affect
behavior for the last decade, said that it could be women are tipping
men off in subtle ways. It may have to do with how a woman dresses,
said Gangestad. Or women may be openly gazing at other men, or
flirting conspicuously. Yet another possibility is as a woman
initiates sex more, her partner spends more time with her. And, say
researchers, it's conceivable that men are hard-wired to detect when
a woman is ovulating.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think men or women have any conscious awareness that they
are behaving any differently," said Garver. "I don't think that men
are aware and thinking, 'Oh, my partner is ovulating now so I think
that she is interested in other men.'"</TE>
<TE>   In a University of Texas at Austin study released last year, a
psychologist asked men to sniff T-shirts that had been worn by women
at varying stages of their menstrual cycle, women whom the men had
never seen. When the men were asked to select the T-shirts that were
most pleasing, they chose those donned by women ovulating or in the
fertile phase. Men, it appears, have an inherent ability to detect
whether a woman is fertile.</TE>
<TE>   Ovulation offers its own advantages to women. In two separate
studies conducted by Gangestad and Thornhill in 1998 and 1999,
respectively, women during the fertile phase of their cycle were
asked to smell T-shirts worn by men the women never saw. When the
women were asked to choose the T-shirts most pleasing in scent, women
who were in their fertile phase chose T-shirts worn by men with the
most symmetrical physical features. (Body and facial symmetry are
considered markers of good health and superior genes.) Gangestad and
Thornhill theorized that women are able to select the most
symmetrical men during their fertile cycle when it counts most, when
they are most likely to conceive if they have sex. Other studies have
found that women also prefer more masculine facial features during
the brief fertile phase.</TE>
<TE>   What can this mean for modern-day romance and relationships? Will
men start tracking their wives' and girlfriends' menstrual cycles?
Will there be a flurry of ovulation detection kit sales to men who
fear their women will act on their sexual urges and fantasies? Next
up: How men's testosterone levels are affected by women's fertility
phase.</TE>
<TE>   "The next study we are doing is going to measure daily
testosterone levels from guys and how that might interact with their
partner's fertility cycle," said Gangestad, who added that each man
will also be asked to report on his own behavior during his
girlfriend's or wife's fertility phase.</TE>

<LD>BEFORE THE KNIFE</LD>
<LD>   Memories of an</LD>
<LD>   African Childhood</LD>
<TE>   By Carolyn Slaughter</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf</TE>
<TE>   240 pages, $23</TE>
<TE>   Why write your story as a memoir rather than a novel? Both genres
enable an author to explore personal history. One allows greater
imaginative latitude, while the other suggests a greater commitment
to factual truth. Blurring these dis- tinctions is not easy for
readers; Lillian Hellman received her share of criticism for
departing from the truth in her otherwise compelling memoirs
"Pentimento" and "Scoundrel Time."</TE>
<TE>   A memoir, to succeed, should vibrate with veracity, but readers
must know that not everything that seems candid is necessarily true,
something to keep in mind when reading Carolyn Slaughter's memoirs of
an African childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Like Kathryn Harrison's much-talked-about memoir "The Kiss,"
Slaughter's "Before the Knife" is based upon a shocking act between a
father and daughter. But where Harrison and her father committed
their act as consenting adults, Slaughter tells us she was only 6
when her father first raped her: "This rape, and the others that were
to follow, obliterated in one moment the innocence of my childhood
and the fragile structure of our English family life. I showed my
mother all the proof she needed, and my older sister was right there
in the room with me, in the bed across from mine. But once it had
happened, we decided it had never happened at all."</TE>
<TE>   Slaughter drops this bombshell at the very outset of her story,
and she proceeds to relate the rest of her history without referring
to the incidents again until the end of the book.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, she presents the story of a British colonial family in
various places in southern Africa, including Swaziland, Bechuanaland
(now Botswana) and the Union of South Africa (from 1961 onward, the
Republic of South Africa). We meet the domineering, difficult,
teetotaler father, the snobbish, distant mother and their three
daughters, of whom Carolyn is the middle one. There is a great deal
of what in old-fashioned travelogues used to be called "local color":
poisonous snakes, crocodiles, disease-infested rivers and harsh
desert landscape.</TE>
<TE>   And there is the book-long extended metaphor inviting us to note
the similarities between the depredations of British colonialism in
Africa and one particular colonial official's rape of his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is virtually impossible--and possibly impertinent--to
attempt to assess the veracity of a writer's account of her private
experiences, there are some things that lend conviction to a memoir
and some that do not. Slaughter conveys the dangerous unforgiving
landscape of the Kalahari Desert with searing immediacy, and she has
filled her story with political detail and zeitgeist that ought to
lend heft and credence to her story but don't. One has to wonder how
anyone who lived through the events in that time and place could
possibly have misremembered so many of them.</TE>
<TE>   To note but a few of Slaughter's many solecisms: While aptly
remarking upon the racism of most colonialists, she says that the
marriage of the Paramount Chief of Bechuanaland to a white British
woman in 1948 made him more acceptable to colonials, when in fact,
his interracial marriage led to his being exiled from his own country
for much of the time that Slaughter was there.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was it true, as she alleges, that whites in southern Africa
"loved [Ghanaian leader Kwame] Nkrumah because he knew how to think
white." On the contrary, Nkrumah, a nationalist who espoused Marxism
and Pan-Africanism, was anything but a tame figure. Slaughter's
history of the Huguenots in South Africa not only conflates them with
the Dutch settlers but places their trek into the interior two
centuries before it actually happened. Her account of the Boer War is
inaccurate and garbled.</TE>
<TE>   And the errors are not confined to matters historical: Shotguns do
not shoot bullets, nor do ships' officers take off their tropical
uniforms and don dark clothing as they approach the equator.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does it enhance the authenticity of the zeitgeist when
Slaughter jarringly and repeatedly refers to her family's visits to
what was then the Union of South Africa as "going to the Republic."
It became the Republic of South Africa in 1961, a year after she and
her family left Africa (she writes that they departed before the
Sharpeville Massacre of March 1960).</TE>
<TE>   And she misses genuine quirks and oddities that might have
enriched her tale. Writing, for instance, of Mafeking, the
then-capital of Bechuanaland, why not mention its unique distinction
of being the only capital in the world located outside the borders of
its own country, it being located in the neighboring country of South
Africa?</TE>
<TE>   Often mistaken not only in matters of fact but sometimes even in
her recollections of the spirit of the times, Slaughter further
undermines credulity by overreaching in her attempt to link her
personal sense of violation with her somewhat simplistic notions of
colonial history. "You had only to glance at an atlas to see how much
of the world was painted red, the scarlet mark of British conquest
and possession, the boot on the neck of the dispossessed," she writes
in a characteristic display of purple prose mixing memory and
hyperbole. While it may be impossible for us finally to know the deep
truth of this writer's family history, it does seem clear that the
passion she feels about her own past has skewed her perceptions of
the larger historical past.</TE>

<HD>Spot's Co-Star</HD>
<DH>His 'dog' retired, but Cal Worthington has family,
business and that darn jingle</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Cal Worthington's dog Spot ever writes a tell-all biography about
his famous master, here are some tidbits he might include:</LD>
<LD>   * During the 1970s energy crunch, Cal sold motorized pogo sticks.</LD>
<LD>   * His children range in age from 18 months to 55 years. And
Cal, 81, is hoping to have another with wife No. 3.</LD>
<TE>   * When one of Worthington's trademark cowboy hats is auctioned for
charity, the bids are higher if people think Spot relieved himself on
it.</TE>
<TE>   * Cal dislikes the car business, which is why he also operates 10
ranches, including a 1.2-million-acre spread in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   * If Cal's wife offers to saute some mushrooms for you, be very
afraid.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a rain-drenched Monday, Calvin Coolidge Worthington is wheeling
and dealing from a ramshackle old bunkhouse in the middle of an
almond farm. "Here's a dandy Toyota Tercel for $7,950," he chirps,
reading from cue cards. "And, boy, here's a beautiful Nissan Sentra
for $6,950."</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, Worthington would pilot his Learjet to the
various cities in his empire--Houston, Phoenix, Seattle--and tape TV
ads on location. Now, he stands in front of a green wall at his
Northern California ranch and lets a computer superimpose his
6-foot-4 image into an Alaska snowstorm for his Anchorage dealership
or a sunset for his Long Beach or Carlsbad lots. Spot, who was
officially retired in the late 1980s, is seen only in vintage clips
that are spliced between shots of gleaming Dodges and Fords.</TE>
<TE>   Worthington started scaling back a few years ago, selling off
dealerships and taping ads from home. But he hasn't exactly slowed
down.</TE>
<TE>   His 42-year-old wife, Bonnie, insists she can hardly keep up with
him. "You have to ride motorcycles, play tennis, travel at the drop
of a hat. At the PX Ranch in Nevada [which was once owned by Bing
Crosby], Cal still rides with the ranchers all day in blistering heat
. . . and when they're branding cattle, he's right out there,
dragging calves to the fire."</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Worthington made his first foray into politics as a
spokesman against California Assembly Bill 1058, which seeks to curb
global warming by limiting carbon-dioxide emissions from cars. Noting
that carbon dioxide is the same gas that humans expel while
breathing, he jokes that bureaucrats might try to outlaw exhaling
next. His appearance in a blitz of ads sponsored by the California
Motor Car Dealers Assn. has helped to derail the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Worthington's previous environmental record consists of selling
motorized pogo sticks and pedal-powered cars that "get 10 miles to
the hamburger" during the energy crisis. He also offered kits to
convert gasoline engines to propane.</TE>
<TE>   Such gimmicks have helped make him a Southern California icon--or
nuisance, depending on your tolerance for his 26-stanza "Go see Cal,
go see Cal, go see Cal" jingle, which he penned and sang in the early
1970s and still uses.</TE>
<TE>   Other stunts include hanging upside down from an airplane wing ("I
will stand upon my head to beat all deals"), riding a hippo through
Watts and promising to eat a bug if customers found cheaper prices.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, his signature gimmick is the "dog Spot" ad, which
featured practically every varmint except a dog. The original
commercial, in 1971, was a spoof of two competitors, Ralph Williams
and Fletcher Jones. Williams had taken to the airwaves with a German
shepherd named Storm, and Jones appeared on TV cuddling puppies from
the pound.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided I'd mimic them," Worthington recalls. So he borrowed a
gorilla, chained it to a car bumper and let the cameras roll. With
the ape snarling in the background, Worthington began his folksy
spiel: "Howdy, I'm Cal Worthington and this is my dog Spot. I found
this little fella down at the pound and he's so full of love." Then,
in a jab at Williams, he added, "I can outsell that dealer in the
Valley. And, what's more, my dog can whip his dog."</TE>
<TE>   The commercial was a hit. Worthington followed it with a menagerie
of other Spots, including a tiger, camel, elephant, alligator, frog,
penguin, anteater, porcupine, bear, lizard (blown up so it appeared
to be the size of a dinosaur) and Shamu the killer whale, which Cal
rode bareback at Sea World.</TE>
<TE>   "Those animals really made me famous," he says. Dolly Madison
enlisted Worthington to do a TV commercial for its doughnuts. And
Johnny Carson had Cal and a goose on "The Tonight Show." When the
bird soiled Worthington's white Western suit, Carson quipped, "Be
glad it wasn't that elephant sitting on your lap."</TE>
<TE>   Worthington put car-dealership advertising on the map, says Gary
Belis, spokesman for the Television Bureau of Advertising, which
tracks spending on TV commercials. "He is probably the best-known car
dealer pitchman in television history."</TE>
<TE>   But he learned by watching the masters. Earl "Madman" Muntz
dressed up in a Napoleon hat and red long johns while telling L.A.
viewers, "I wanna give 'em away, but my wife won't let me. She's
crazy." And Tony Holzer, a used car dealer who went by the moniker
Honest John, wore a white robe and halo in his ads.</TE>
<TE>   When Cal is asked why those names are largely forgotten and he has
achieved cult status, he replies, "I guess it's persistence. I don't
do anything very well. I just stick at it."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, he doesn't even like selling cars.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started in 1946, I thought if I could just make $25,000, I
could buy a ranch," he says. "But then you get hooked."</TE>
<TE>   Today, his six dealerships, three shopping centers and one office
tower gross more than $600 million a year, according to his daughter,
Courtney, who runs the company's Folsom car center. Cal also owns 10
ranches in California, Oregon and Nevada on which he raises cattle,
potatoes, nuts, alfalfa--and a little boy named Cole.</TE>
<TE>   "Meet Cal's latest vice president," says Worthington's wife,
hoisting the 18-month-old boy as she greets a reporter and
photographer at the family's Big W almond ranch, near Chico. "This is
Coldren Wilshire Worthington." (Coldren was the maiden name of
Worthington's mother.)</TE>
<TE>   Later, as the boy stares and smiles at a female visitor,
his mother explains that he's "quite a flirt--it's definitely something
in the DNA."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently so. During a seven-year stretch in the 1970s, Cal
alternately lived with his first wife, Barbara, and model Susan
Henning, the original "Every body needs milk" girl, whom he married
in 1979 after divorcing spouse No. 1. Seven years and two children
later, in 1986, Henning sued for divorce and filed a palimony suit
seeking half of everything Worthington earned during the time they
lived together before marrying. Her attorney, Marvin Mitchelson,
estimated Worthington's riches at $50 million to $100 million, but
Henning lost the case.</TE>
<TE>   Worthington met his third wife, Bonnie Reese, while she was
working at KZAP-FM in Sacramento and had recruited him to be a
celebrity DJ (along with singer Huey Lewis and former "Leave It to
Beaver" star Jerry Mathers). He later told his secretary to "find
that Bonnie Reese" so he could ask her out. At the time, she was in
her 20s and he was in his 60s.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a little old," Cal jokes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, they married on a bluff top at the Big W ranch. And in
1998, she burned their house to the ground. "Yeah, it was my fault,"
says Bonnie, a good-natured Long Beach native who wears a custom-made
Big W pendant around her neck. While sauteing mushrooms, she left the
kitchen to read something to Cal and a fire started. Unfortunately,
the kitchen's extinguishers hadn't been juiced up in 15 years and by
the time firefighters arrived, everything was lost, including three
pets. The family has been living in an old ranch house ever since,
but the new home is almost ready. "We used the same foundation,"
Worthington says. "We loved that house."</TE>
<TE>   But some flourishes have been added. The lights in the kitchen
will shine through a stained-glass ceiling. The showers and bathtubs
are lined with jasper stones collected on the ranch. The basement has
a gym for Cal. And the black-walnut kitchen counters will be
lacquered with the same coating used on cars.</TE>
<TE>   Hardwood floors and a big stone fireplace give the house a
mountain-lodge feel. "We weren't looking for something flashy," Cal
explains. "We were looking for something comfortable. . . . I used to
have a pretty nice house in Baldwin Hills, but I much prefer it
here."</TE>
<TE>   Out back, there's a two-story treehouse, a tennis court, an
airstrip for his planes and a "swimming hole" built with the same
jasper stones that fill the bathrooms. "I didn't want a plastic
pool," Cal drawls. "I wanted something rustic."</TE>
<TE>   Although Worthington hasn't worked with Spot since the late 1980s,
he still surrounds himself with animals, including three dogs,
several chickens and a pair of rickety old horses. Driving his red
Chevy Suburban along a narrow, tree-lined lane on the ranch ("Isn't
this a beautiful lane?" he says, "A painter couldn't do a better
lane"), he parks beside a pasture and walks toward a blind horse
named Cochise.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 years ago, Cochise arrived at Worthington's South Gate
dealership to play the role of Spot. "He was wearing a derby hat and
son of a gun if I didn't want to buy him for my daughter, Courtney,
who was 6 at the time. She rode that horse all over as a girl."</TE>
<TE>   Cal's other love is flying. During World War II, he led bombing
raids over Berlin and later aspired to be an airline pilot. But "the
airlines wouldn't even talk to me because I didn't have a college
education" (Oklahoma-born Worthington dropped out of school at age
13). So he bought a gas station in Corpus Christi, Texas, and soon
discovered a knack for selling cars. He rented a dusty lot for $25,
recruited his dad to help him paint signs and paid the phone company
to run a line to a locked steel box on the side of a nearby garage.
"I had a brass key to the phone," he recalls. "Every time you
answered it, you got an electric shock."</TE>
<TE>   After selling his first three cars and making $500, "I thought I'd
died and gone to heaven," he says. "Then I had to hitchhike home
because I'd sold my car too."</TE>
<TE>   By 1950, he had moved to Los Angeles and acquired a Hudson
dealership on Slauson Avenue. As his business expanded, he began
sponsoring country music shows. "I'd be on the lot till midnight
doing live ads because there was no videotape until 1956 or '57," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he moonlighted as a radio traffic reporter, circling the
city in one of his planes every morning and afternoon in exchange for
advertising time on three local stations. But the long hours at work
took a toll on his family, he concedes.</TE>
<TE>   There were some business setbacks too. In 1969, an accountant
embezzled $350,000 and nearly broke him. In 1978, the state attorney
general charged him with deceptive advertising (Worthington
eventually paid $50,000 to settle the case but admitted no
wrongdoing). And in 1995, when he briefly owned the struggling
Claremont Auto Center, General Motors dealerships, saying he had weak
customer-service ratings at other GM lots.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the rough spots, Cal always seems to bounce back.
Blessed with buckets of down-home charm and determination, he is as
durable as the Energizer Bunny. Alas, so is his jingle, which still
tortures insomniacs on 22 stations in Los Angeles and San Diego. "If
I had a dollar for every ad I've run, I could quit the car business,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he could quit anyway. With billions of dollars in car
sales under his custom-designed Big W belt, he doesn't need to work.
But he isn't quite ready to ride off into the sunset astride Spot.
"I've done everything," he says. "Traveled the world, eaten at fine
restaurants, sipped champagne at the great watering holes of the
world. The only thing left is to raise another child."</TE>
<TE>   And sell a few more cars, of course. "If I retired," Cal says, "I
bet you I wouldn't live a month."</TE>

<LD>Summer is almost here. It's the perfect time to make books your best
friends. Here are some ways books can keep you company.</LD>
<LD>   * Take a book with you to the supermarket, and the checkout lines
won't seem so long.</LD>
<LD>   * Read in the doctor's waiting room, and before you know it your
name is being called.</LD>
<TE>   * Read at night and escape to a magical world without leaving the
comfort and safety of your bed.</TE>
<TE>   * Try out a new hobby. Do you want to learn sign language or how
to bake a cake? Do you want to plant a garden or learn to
roller-skate? Books can teach you how to do these things.</TE>
<TE>   * Start a book club. Tell everyone you know to read the same book
then get together to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   * Use books to help you plan a party for your friends. You might
want to check out several books: one about games, a cookbook and
maybe a songbook too.</TE>
<TE>   * Gather your brothers or sisters together for a story hour. Use
puppets and dolls to make the stories engaging.</TE>
<TE>   You can make friends with books this Saturday at the L.A. Kids
Read Festival from noon to 4 p.m. at the Richard J. Riordan Central
Library, 630 W. 5th St. in downtown Los Angeles. This free event
kicks off its "Pop Up for Reading Club" with an afternoon of
musicians, magicians, puppeteers, clowns, crafts and storytellers.
Author and actress Jamie Lee Curtis will also be there to receive the
Los Angeles Public Library Reader Leader Award. Curtis is the author
of "When I Was Little: A Four-Year-Old's Memoir of Her Youth," and
"Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born." For more information,
call (213) 228-7006, or visit www.lapl. org.</TE>

<HD>Five Ways to Scratch the Seven- (or Six-) Year Itch</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the season when everyone seems to be celebrating their
anniversary. I am, and thus I'm certain everyone else is too. Just
call it a reporter's instinct.</LD>
<LD>   I recently observed my sixth wedding anniversary, while my wife
marked her fifth. We've just agreed to disagree. She claims to have
proof: county court records, credit card bills, sworn affidavits from
the reverend, her parents, my parents and 150 guests. But I don't
care how many papers she throws at me, my gut tells me it's our
sixth.</LD>
<LD>   But what really matters is that we are still together--a fact that
astonishes people who used to like me until they got to know me. Many
have asked how I keep the vim and verve in my marriage even though
I'm as physically and mentally agile now as Ozzy Osbourne.</LD>
<TE>   Here are the five rules I give them:</TE>
<TE>   1) Keep Score</TE>
<TE>   Because if you're not keeping score, then you don't know who is
winning.</TE>
<TE>   Most couples already do keep score. They just do it in a
seat-of-the-pants kind of way. You see them point out a flaw or
shortcoming here, identify a mistake there.</TE>
<TE>   But unless they document each individual error, they're never
going to have an accurate tally.</TE>
<TE>   And without that, there's no way to determine who is a better
person. Right now, I'm the better person, according to the big
scoreboard above our bed--Me: 16,443 shortcomings to Wife: 16,448.
Remember, low score wins.</TE>
<TE>   I keep score the old-fashioned way. I record her mistakes minute
by minute in one of those cute personal journals sold in the chain
bookstores. My wife prefers the Palm. You decide what's best for you.
I won't lie to you, it's hard work. Sometimes, we can barely get
through a meal because we're both so busy scribbling down the other's
screw-ups. But we think our relationship is worth the trouble. Isn't
yours?</TE>
<TE>   2) Don't Change</TE>
<TE>   When you marry, you tie the knot with a known quantity. You didn't
marry a particular person only for them to become some surprise
package you're supposed to unwrap each day. If I wanted to be
surprised, I would have married Drew Barrymore, Dennis Rodman or
both.</TE>
<TE>   That's why when I married my wife, I promised her I'd be a rock
for her. Maybe not a fancy, polished rock. Maybe not the smartest
rock in the garden either. But a proud rock, nevertheless, one she
could count on, skip across a lake, and even throw at the neighbor's
dog if the situation called for it.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, change threatens a marriage. A couple of years ago I
noticed an alarming change in my wife. For no reason other than she
was being kept awake at night, she started drinking decaf. I accused
her of a bait-and-switch. Who was this person I was sleeping with?
She never touched decaf when we were dating, now all of a sudden no
caffeine? I told her she might as well just shave her head, move to
Tibet and become a Buddhist monk.</TE>
<TE>   When she got back, she had changed. But I fell in love with her
all over again, despite the stubble on her head. Since she was a
different person, I decided we had to get remarried and vow never to
change again.</TE>
<TE>   3) Just Fix It</TE>
<TE>   A corollary to the Don't Change rule: If change does occur, you
don't have to accept it. You can simply "fix" it. Because if someone
doesn't love you enough to be exactly what you want, what's the
point?</TE>
<TE>   Summon all your willpower and force your spouse to revert to his
or her old ways. Never relent. Just think of yourself as a mighty
ocean smoothing out a rough piece of glass. If that doesn't work for
you, imagine you're a big tank crushing a soda can under its treads.</TE>
<TE>   4) Listen</TE>
<TE>   The experts tell us that listening is the key to a happy marriage.
Sure, it's important, but here's my point about listening: Don't
listen to the experts, especially that bald guy on "Oprah."</TE>
<TE>   5) Forgive</TE>
<TE>   Forgiveness may be the most essential component of any successful
relationship. We all make mistakes, just make sure your spouse makes
more. (See Rule No. 1)</TE>
<TE>   But by all means, forgive. Let bygones be bygones. Because when we
hold on to anger, hoard our hurts, it really only injures us. It can
even cause an upset tummy. But while you're forgiving, never, ever,
ever forget. And never let them forget that you haven't forgotten
what it is they've done, particularly in front of company. Remember,
all is fair in love and marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Happy anniversary!</TE>

<LD>My name is Fluffy. I live with the Rogers family--Mr. and Mrs.
Rogers, Jilly, and her brother, Johnny. When I was a kitten I looked
like a little white powder puff. That's why they named me Fluffy. Now
I'm a fat cat with a pink nose, bright green eyes, and long Angora
fur. Sometimes Mrs. Rogers smiles at me and calls me, "Precious,"
and, of course, I am.</LD>
<LD>   I'm also very persnickety. I like my litter box kept immaculately
clean. I like my morning saucer of cream slightly warm, and after
breakfast I rub against Jilly's leg to remind her to brush my silky
white coat and tie a blue satin ribbon around my neck.</LD>
<LD>   When Jilly and Johnny go to school and Mr. and Mrs. Rogers go to
work, I like to snooze on the sofa until the little bird jumps out of
the clock and cheeps, "Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!" Then I know it's 3
o'clock, and Jilly will be coming home. That's when we play together
with my catnip mouse and hand-crocheted ball.</LD>
<TE>   In the evening, after I've had my tuna served on a china plate, I
curl up on Mr. Rogers' lap and watch television. Then, we all go to
bed, and I sleep snuggled next to Jilly and her stuffed animals.</TE>
<TE>   I guess you can tell I'm pampered. Well, I was pampered--until
that dog came along. That Billy! Now everything is different.</TE>
<TE>   You probably remember Billy. He's that black-and-white border
collie that turned everything upside-down. It took the whole Rogers
family to train that dog to stop squatting in the wrong places and
stop chewing up Mrs. Rogers' daffodil bulbs and Mr. Rogers' slippers
and Jilly's Snoopy dog. And he did finally stop all that. What he
hasn't stopped is chasing me! And I don't like it!</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Fluffy be able to dodge Billy?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Gould likes to write about her pets. Her book, "Golden
Daffodils," has a cat named Pickles that is a lot like Fluffy. This
story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been only two weeks since East Timor became the newest country
on the planet, and already it has fallen out of the news. But the
triumph of that day, achieved against such impossible odds, will be
with me forever.</LD>
<LD>   The last time I had seen East Timor, it was over my shoulder. I
was retreating with a pack of election monitors and journalists,
racing for the last flight out of the country through a gantlet of
Indonesian military and militia blockades. They were chasing us away
so we wouldn't witness and report on the destruction they were about
to unleash.</LD>
<LD>   At the airport in Dili, there was no security, nobody looked at my
bags or documents. I have no stamp showing the date of departure:
Sept. 5, 1999. It was the week after the country had voted
overwhelmingly for independence after 24 years of brutal occupation
by Indonesia.</LD>
<TE>   I had gone to the region as a U.N.-accredited election monitor
along with many other solidarity workers. When I returned in May, it
was to witness East Timor's birth as a nation.</TE>
<TE>   I was drawn by memories of those left behind on my first
visit--especially the family in whose mountain compound I had
bunked--and the memory of my brother, who would have been there if
only he could.</TE>
<TE>   At the airport, I again found myself in the midst of solidarity
workers and journalists. This time we were not being chased, but
welcomed. Instead of militia blockades, there were workers from the
United Nations Transitional Administration for East Timor calmly
seeing us through customs.</TE>
<TE>   On my previous visit, graffiti scrawled on walls said: "You want
freedom ... eat rocks." This time, the road from the airport was
lined with fluttering banners for ... Coca-Cola.</TE>
<TE>   We election monitors were there three years ago to help make sure
the vote was free and fair. It was neither. The intimidation by
Indonesian forces was horrific, but 99% of the voters turned out
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Our presence was also intended to help ensure that nothing bad
would happen after the vote--the idea being that the Indonesian army
wouldn't try anything with so many foreign witnesses around. In that
mission, we failed utterly.</TE>
<TE>   After the election results were announced, we were both forced and
allowed to leave. We were helpless to stop a country from being
crushed. Guilt over that haunted me and the others who got out.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the carnage ended, nearly 70% of the buildings in the
country had been burned--including nearly every school. Militias
killed an estimated 1,000 people; a quarter million refugees fled or
were forced into West Timor--50,000 of whom remain trapped there.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, East Timor survived. And I and the other
international solidarity workers were among those invited back to see
the flag raised May 20 over a new nation.</TE>
<TE>   I first became involved in the East Timor solidarity movement the
week after my brother John died. He had been a lifelong activist, if
the word lifelong can be used for someone who lived only to 42. You
name the cause, chances are he was involved with it. He was always
showing me articles about issues that struck a chord with him, hoping
I'd share his passion. In 1997, he was diagnosed with stage-four lung
cancer, and exactly one year later, it claimed him.</TE>
<TE>   One of the last articles he'd shown me had been about East Timor,
a tiny half-a-country suffering under the illegal occupation of
Indonesia since 1975. He wanted me to get involved. When I returned
home to L.A. after his death, in my grief I turned to the cause he
had handed me.</TE>
<TE>   Working with the East Timor Action Network was pretty much the
only thing that got me out of bed during those first months. I knew
what that was about: I couldn't save my brother from suffering or
from death, but maybe I could save someone else.</TE>
<TE>   It was selfish, really, but it felt purposeful when nothing else
did. We held rallies outside the Indonesian consulate, we hosted
fund-raisers, we went to Washington to lobby members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   And then the day came that people barely dared hope for--Indonesia
was going to allow a referendum in East Timor. People would get to
vote on whether they wanted continued Indonesian rule or
independence. The catch? Indonesia insisted on providing security for
the vote.</TE>
<TE>   When I was invited by the International Federation for East Timor
to serve as a monitor, my first response was no. I was afraid of
getting hurt or killed, of seeing someone else get hurt or killed, of
malaria, of dysentery--the list of fears was embarrassingly long. But
this vote was everything the solidarity movement had worked toward.</TE>
<TE>   I knew I needed to see it through. And I knew John would have gone
if he'd been around.</TE>
<TE>   When invited back for the celebration, my first response was
again, no. It was impractical, unaffordable; I couldn't just drop all
my work and travel 24 hours for a big soiree. But then, I was drawn
back again. How could I not go?</TE>
<TE>   The circularity called to me, or maybe the Hollywood ending of it.
And of course, I thought of John. He was never one to miss a good
party.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1999, I was stationed with a team of six in Ainaro, a cool
mountain town of 2,000. We lived in the compound of Rita and Mario
Ferreira Sarmento. They had 13 children, not all of whom were home.
(One, Steven, was a member of Falantil, the armed resistance
movement; he lived in the mountains hiding from and fighting the
Indonesian military.)</TE>
<TE>   On the day the vote results were announced, after our team had
been recalled to the capital Dili for security reasons, Rita and her
family were sitting down to breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had the radio aired the news that the vote was
overwhelmingly in favor of independence than a militia member set
fire to their house.</TE>
<TE>   They had time to grab the children and race out the back door into
the mountains. The rest of the town ran too, as every house was
systematically burned down. They survived in the mountains living off
stream water, bananas and root vegetables for four weeks. I knew none
of this at the time. I only knew--as I prayed for them each day--that
Rita was the strongest person I'd ever met, and if anyone could save
her family, she would. She did.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, I was staying with Rita and her family in Dili, in
another house--the one they had left Dec. 6, 1975, the day they saw
men parachuting down from the sky. They fled to Ainaro before the
Indonesian attack on Dili began, where the slaughter was so intense
that the water in the harbor turned red with blood.</TE>
<TE>   Now the family was back home and Mario had been elected to the new
Assembly, representing Ainaro. I finally met Steven, who quit the
Falantil after the Indonesians left. He was tired of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the independence celebration, I walked with about
200,000 others to Taci Tolo as dignitaries from around the world
drove by in their Range Rovers. One East Timorese friend cracked that
she didn't want the dignitaries there, she just wanted the people
who'd actually helped over the years.</TE>
<TE>   The irony of then-President Clinton's presence wasn't lost on her.
Ever since Ford and Kissinger gave the go-ahead to Suharto for the
invasion in 1975, the U.S. had provided nearly all the weapons
Indonesia used against East Timor. The ambassador to Indonesia,
Stapleton Roy, said in 1999: "Indonesia matters, East Timor doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, during the independence celebration, when Clinton was
introduced, the crowd cheered like he was a rock star. In 1999, after
weeks of carnage and intense international pressure, Clinton cut off
military ties to Indonesia. The Indonesian government was jolted into
allowing U.N. peacekeepers into East Timor, and the destruction
stopped. It was too little too late, but it wasn't forgotten by the
Timorese.</TE>
<TE>   And, despite a long, bloody occupation, and bitter ending, the
Timorese cheered the presence of Indonesian President Megawati
Sukarnoputri at the celebration, welcoming her and acknowledging the
opposition she encountered from her own government over the visit.</TE>
<TE>   During the ceremonies, I was sitting with Asiri, one of Rita's
sons. During a film tribute to the heroes that showed picture after
picture of the fallen who couldn't see this glorious day, he began to
cry. Like every other Timorese, he lost loved ones in this
struggle--including close friends tortured to death by the Indonesian
military.</TE>
<TE>   Then the living heroes were honored: Falantil soldiers, men and
women, filed silently into the arena and up to the stage, through
lines of children holding candles. Everyone had suffered so much, and
sacrificed so much, to get to this day that the emotion was
overwhelming. At midnight, after speeches were made by the new
leaders of the country--the flag of the U.N. transitional government
was lowered, and the East Timor flag was raised.</TE>
<TE>   There were fireworks and music and dancing into the night. I got
to bed as the sun rose on the first day of East Timor's independence.</TE>
<TE>   In the light of day, it is hard not to be overwhelmed by the
amount of work that lies ahead. The U.N. administration, caught up in
its own lumbering bureaucracy, has done little to repair East Timor.
The newest country is one of the poorest, with an average income
below $1 a day, and it faces formidable political, health and social
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   As a friend in Dili put it, East Timor was exploited by Portuguese
colonial rulers for 400 years, oppressed by Indonesia for 24, run for
almost three by the U.N. and is now ruled by people whose only
previous experience with governments is in resisting them.</TE>
<TE>   The day before I left, a meeting was held between those in the new
government and about 150 solidarity workers to discuss how we and
rest of the world could help now: East Timor needs to feed its people
and rebuild. It wants grants, not loans that will later trap it in a
cycle of debt. It seeks justice and asks for an international
war-crimes tribunal. It wants not to be forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   When I said goodbye to Rita in 1999, we burst out crying as we
embraced, holding on tightly, not knowing when we'd see each other
again, what was to come. This time, again we embraced and cried. But
she says she's coming to the U.S. in 2003. And she expects me back in
Dili too.</TE>
<TE>   Last time I came home in shock. I couldn't bear hearing anyone
complain about anything, and the world looked cracked and warped.
This time the shock is more subtle. I still can't bear to hear anyone
complain, but oddly, everyone and everything I encounter looks
beautiful to me. The grief is gone.</TE>

<LD>It was Hollywood Versace-style at the seventh annual spring luncheon
benefiting the Children's Action Network and Westside Children's
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas hosted the event Thursday at
their picturesque Hancock Park villa, designed in 1926 by Hoover Dam
architect Gordon B. Kauffman.</LD>
<LD>   In a corset-back, red tank top showing off her heart-shaped
"Antonio" tattoo, Griffith said in her kittenish voice, "You're
finally someone in the Hollywood wives club if you get to host this
luncheon."</LD>
<TE>   The 100 mostly female guests sipped bubbly out of frosted Versace
flutes and ate lunch off green-and-gold patterned Versace plates,
while sitting under a tent decorated with thousands of blooms in
blindingly bright Versace pink.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a day I will remember for the rest of my life," said
designer Donatella Versace, appropriately dressed in a pink tank top
and pants, before presenting a runway show of her fall collection.</TE>
<TE>   As Carmen Kass, Carolyn Murphy and other models strutted down a
kaleidoscope-patterned runway, choruses of oohs and aahs rang out
from the audience of serious shoppers. "I have to have that!" co-host
Rita Wilson said, applauding a taupe suede trench with black beaded
embroidery.</TE>
<TE>   After the show, lunch began--for those who felt like eating after
the parade of hot bods. Among those nibbling on halibut were Tippi
Hedren, Lucy Liu, Rosanna Arquette, Kelly Lynch, Kate Capshaw and her
daughter Jessica Capshaw, the singer Eve and Angela Bassett.</TE>
<TE>   After the salad course, Banderas fetched a cutie, daughter Stella,
6, for show-and-tell. "She's got her mother's legs," said Anjelica
Huston, in between puffs of a cigarette she was smoking with a
holder. Dakota, 13, Griffith's daughter from her previous marriage to
Don Johnson, joined the party later.</TE>
<TE>   At another table, the always amusing and well-dressed Jennifer
Tilly (in Dior) was recounting her visit to the infamously exclusive
Voyage store in London. "I had to recite all of my credits at the
door and they still wouldn't let me in," she said. "I told the guy I
was nominated for an Oscar for a Woody Allen film and he said, 'Who
is this Woody Allen? I've never heard of him.'"</TE>
<TE>   The luncheon, co-sponsored by In Style magazine, raised about
$100,000. Jennifer Perry, executive director of the Children's Action
Network, said the money would help find homes for 134,000 foster
children, many of whom are in L.A. "They are just like the kids you
see walking down the street every day," she said. "They just need
love and stability to flourish."</TE>

<HD>Artists Put Pressure on for Benefits</HD>
<DH>Pensions: Filings add to lawsuit against union's retirement
fund arm over record firms' contributions.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twelve years ago, Motown diva Mary Wells was so sick and destitute
that she checked into a charity ward of County-USC Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Diagnosed with throat cancer, the 48-year-old former pop star had
no health insurance and no pension to provide for her four young
children.</LD>
<LD>   "Despite the millions of dollars the industry made off of my
mother's music, there she was, the 'First Lady of Motown,' abandoned
to die in a county sick bed," said Stacy Womack, daughter of the late
singer whose death from cancer sparked a burgeoning artist rights
movement. "There is no safety net in this business."</LD>
<TE>   After Wells died, her family joined soul singer Sam Moore of Sam
and Dave fame, the estates of Jackie Wilson and Curtis Mayfield, and
other artists in 1993 to sue a branch of the American Federation of
Television &amp; Radio Artists union for failing to provide them with
adequate health and retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians accused AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds of breach
of fiduciary duty and violating federal pension laws by failing to
ensure that record companies pay contributions into their benefits
plan. They also sued all the major record companies.</TE>
<TE>   AFTRA, based in Washington, is the union that represents music
acts that sign with major labels.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, other artists have joined the legal battle.
But reaching a settlement in the case has proved difficult. One
problem is that the AFTRA fund is a separate entity from the union,
and the organizations disagree on how to settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   In March, trustees for the AFTRA fund, which has nearly $2 billion
in assets, proposed an $8-million settlement to resolve the case for
20,000 artists, most of whom would receive only a couple hundred
dollars under the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to fight this thing to my last living breath," said
soul star Moore. "The trustees are trying to give us a little shut-up
money to make us go away. Not me. I've been fighting nine years to
right this wrong. I'm not giving up now."</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Artist Coalition, a recently formed trade group
composed of more than 100 top acts, filed a brief in U.S. District
Court in Atlanta on Thursday opposing the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   And complicating things further was a legal brief filed by AFTRA
union officials opposing the settlement proposal as "manifestly
unfair to artists." The move comes as AFTRA is trying to renegotiate
a three-year contract to represent recording artists with the world's
five largest music corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Hilary Rosen, chairman of the Recording Industry Assn. of America,
which represents the five largest music corporations, said: "AFTRA
officials are going through a problem similar to what the current
management at record companies are going through, which is how can
you truly pay for the sins of your father if there are no adequate
records to know the facts of the sin."</TE>
<TE>   Moore and other artists are challenging a business model in which
low-level employees at record companies receive better benefits than
the artists whose music they sell. Moore said artists who create the
product on which the industry thrives are tired of being treated like
freelancers and left to fend for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, 66, said he still must go on tour each year to make ends
meet.</TE>
<TE>   Moore and other former big stars said the AFTRA fund's trustees
have neglected to police record-label contributions to benefit
accounts and failed to perform audits and sue companies caught
violating federal pension laws.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for benefits under the AFTRA arrangement, artists are
required to produce royalty statements proving they earned $7,500 to
$15,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Those who qualify get some health insurance and monthly pension
checks.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike salaried radio and television employees who also are
covered by AFTRA, recording artists have more difficulty
substantiating their income because royalty calculations often are a
convoluted practice in the record business.</TE>
<TE>   Record labels typically pay artists an advance after they sign a
contract. Artists are, however, required to repay the advance and
reimburse the label for costs associated with studio recording, video
production, touring and radio promotion before earning a penny in
royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Record companies also deduct packaging fees and pay reduced
royalty rates for albums sold overseas and in record clubs. In most
cases, artists don't receive a royalty check for years.</TE>
<TE>   Disputes over royalty payments are common in the music business.
In the past, major stars have uncovered hundreds of thousands of
dollars in missing royalties after they audited their record labels'
books.</TE>
<TE>   And music industry consolidation has complicated the issue. Many
bookkeeping records have been lost or destroyed as artist catalogs
have been bought and sold numerous times over the last four decades
in a spate of mergers and acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, several music corporations acknowledged
underpaying blues and soul stars and increased royalty rates on
future CD sales.</TE>
<TE>   That action, however, did nothing to assist artists in
substantiating underpayments by record labels to the AFTRA fund.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed by Moore and others contends that record
companies in the 1950s and 1960s did not accurately report all
royalty earnings to the AFTRA fund and failed to make the required
contributions to their pension accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The current dispute centers primarily on the interpretation of
language in a collective bargaining agreement between the record
labels and AFTRA from 1959 to 1995, which established how much music
companies were required to contribute to the AFTRA fund.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the lawsuit, the disputed language in the
collective bargaining agreement was renegotiated by the parties in
1995 to more clearly define the record companies' contributions to
health and other benefit plans for artists.</TE>
<TE>   AFTRA fund trustees do not plan to tap into any of the
organization's $2 billion in assets to resolve the case. Trustees
intend to use $8 million from an insurance policy to settle the
dispute--about $2 million of which would go directly to the
plaintiffs' lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, the trustees have offered the 15 named
plaintiffs in the suit about $100,000 each. A number of musicians,
including Jerry Butler and Lester Chambers, intend to accept the
offer.</TE>
<TE>   Others, including Moore and the estates of Wells and Wilson, have
been fighting the settlement, contending that it prevents former
stars from recovering benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, opponents of the settlement acquired a powerful new
ally in Greg Hessinger, the national executive director of AFTRA.
Hessinger, who also is an AFTRA fund trustee, deems the settlement
unfair because it would "sacrifice the rights of thousands of
artists" and "deprive [them] of fundamental rights of due process."</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the proposed settlement is scheduled to take place in
the District Court in Atlanta on June 20--just 10 days before AFTRA's
collective bargaining deal with the major labels expires.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, AFTRA proposed that in the future music companies should
be required to contribute a fixed annual amount to the AFTRA fund to
help prevent lapses in benefit coverage for artists.</TE>
<TE>   AFTRA representatives said the industry, which generates more than
$32 billion in annual global sales, will need to collectively
contribute at least $20 million over the next three years to help
bolster health-care and pension coverage for artists in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a relatively small investment in talent for the record
labels that could provide a very effective way to give artists peace
of mind, which will permit them to focus on creating music the public
can enjoy--and purchase," Hessinger said in an interview. "It's a
benefit plan that offers continuous protection for artists and makes
good business sense for music companies."</TE>

<HD>Bristol Merger Talks Reflect Industry Ills</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Drug makers face leaner times, price
pressures and tougher FDA hurdles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., a combination of two of the oldest names in
American pharmaceuticals, has become a takeover target and the
possible object of a multibillion-dollar bidding war in part because
the drug industry faces unprecedented pressure to reduce prices at a
time when the overall development of blockbuster drugs has slowed
considerably.</LD>
<LD>   At the top of the list of suitors is GlaxoSmithKline, Europe's
biggest drug maker and No. 2 in the world behind Pfizer Inc. Industry
sources told The Times that GlaxoSmithKline executives already have
met at Bristol-Myers Squibb offices to discuss a merger, which
sources said could be valued at $62billion.</LD>
<LD>   The on-again, off-again courtship apparently has generated
interest from two other industry giants, Novartis and Pharmacia Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts say the huge profits that many drug makers have been
enjoying for years may be harder to come by in the near future, and
the industry is expected to respond with more mergers and
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "The pharmaceutical companies are smart enough to realize that
there will have to be a payment mechanism for seniors involving
reduced prices," health-care expert Peter Boland said. "They may have
hit the high point for realizing substantial profit margins, and
there will be leaner times ahead."</TE>
<TE>   David Christopher, an analyst for Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co., agreed,
saying that pharmaceutical companies are facing lawsuits and "a tough
FDA environment" in terms of gaining new drug approvals, increased
plant inspections and big fines for quality-control problems.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by market analyst Datamonitor predicted that only
four drug companies out of the 19 with patents on big-selling
blockbuster drugs would continue to reap the double-digit growth
demanded by investors. That, experts say, is forcing changes that
include stronger patent defenses, finding other patentable uses for
current drugs and "bulking up" of research and development through
further acquisitions and partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Neither GlaxoSmithKline nor Bristol-Myers Squibb would comment on
the merger speculation, but analysts said that both companies
illustrate the high and low tides of the patent drug expiration
pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said that combining the two companies makes little
sense because they both are facing generic competition targeting the
best drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Gerber, an analyst for CIBC World Markets, said the biggest
gain for GlaxoSmithKline might simply be short-term cost-cutting.</TE>
<TE>   But the companies are in much different positions. Bristol-Myers
Squibb, which as Bristol-Myers developed Ipana toothpaste in the
early 1900s, has become takeover fodder because it has spent billions
on research for new drugs that haven't panned out, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is still reeling from its ill-fated $2-billion
purchase of the rights to market the anti-cancer drug Erbitux, made
by ImClone Systems Inc. The Food and Drug Administration rejected the
drug's application in December. More recently, Merck &amp; Co. refused to
expand trials for the drug to help it gain approval.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers Squibb also has lost substantial sales revenue to
generic competition with three of its drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Although GlaxoSmithKline is losing its battle to protect its
patent on Augmentin, an antibiotic that generates $2 billion in
annual sales, it still can reap current earnings on three
drugs--Flovent for asthma, Flonase for allergies and the
antidepressant drug Paxil--which together amount to more than $3.1
billion in annual sales. The Flonase and Flovent patents expire late
this year, and Paxil's basic patent runs until December 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "Bristol-Myers Squibb's basic problem is that it hasn't had any
hits on new drugs," said health-care analyst Albert Lowey-Ball.
"GlaxoSmithKline has had some hits, and they have a lot of cash."</TE>
<TE>   Gerber of CIBC World Markets said the companies each have a
different portfolio of drugs and should not face much antitrust
scrutiny. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gerber said, touts its cancer and
cardiovascular drugs, and GlaxoSmithKline is better known for its
antibiotic, respiratory and diabetes medications.</TE>
<TE>   But the goals of the merger deserve close scrutiny, said Arnie
Milstein, a health-care analyst for Mercer Human Resource Consulting
and medical director of the Pacific Business Group on Health. "If it
helps put more emphasis on cost containment and lower prices, it's
good," Milstein said. "If it's to keep prices high, that will be
another loss for consumers."</TE>
<TE>   The possible interest from Novartis and Pharmacia adds another
twist to what might be the future of the pharmaceutical industry.
Analysts, for example, still rated Bristol-Myers Squibb's research
and development team among the best in the industry. It is the
marshaling of brainpower that is driving many industry leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Novartis has announced plans to make the Boston area its new
global hub for research. It hopes to snare some of the region's
well-known research and university talent, much as Pfizer hopes to
capitalize on the talent in the La Jolla and San Diego region by
building a biomedical research campus in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care expert Boland said the big shift in intellectual
capital has gone to biotech companies and to small pharmaceutical
companies that act as incubators.</TE>
<TE>   "Three or four years down the road, the next big breakthroughs in
drug development will come from [those incubators], and you will see
them involved in a lot more manufacturing and distribution agreements
with major pharmaceutical companies."</TE>

<HD>Trader Courted Attention, Trouble</HD>
<DH>Profile: Amr Elgindy, accused of stealing secret FBI data,
led a flashy lifestyle. Some call him a savior; others, a liar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Showing off a Ferrari and an in-your-face attitude, Amr I. "Anthony"
Elgindy peered out of America's TV sets in May 1997 to warn that
small investors "haven't got a prayer" against mobsters and con
artists he said were using bribes and beatings to force Wall Street
brokers to promote worthless stocks to their clients.</LD>
<LD>   "That's not going to happen to me," the Cairo-born stockbroker
with the wrestler's build told Brian Ross of ABC's "20/20." Saying a
bullet inscribed with his name had arrived in the mail, Elgindy
displayed a Colt pistol and a tape recorder--describing them as his
weapons to help authorities battle this empire of corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Today, though, it is Elgindy who is the target of corruption
allegations. Arrested May 22 at his Encinitas office and now being
held without bail in San Diego's Metropolitan Correctional Center, he
faces extradition to New York, accused of stealing secrets from
federal criminal databases with help from FBI agents and then using
the information to reap profits in the stock market.</LD>
<TE>   Elgindy, 34, who contends he's the victim of double-dealing
associates and vindictive regulators, is described by neighbors and
business associates as a man of outsized charm, with an arrogant
streak and a craving for attention. During a controversial career in
the securities business, Elgindy has been an FBI informant, the
defendant in a securities arbitration claim filed by his own
mother--and now a defendant in a stock-manipulation case drawing
national attention.</TE>
<TE>   According to an indictment handed up by a New York grand jury,
Elgindy and his associates, including one former and one current FBI
agent, used confidential material from FBI files to shake down
companies under federal scrutiny or to profit by betting their stock
prices would fall. He is charged with racketeering, fraud, extortion
and obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Assistant U.S. Atty. Ken Breen said at a May 24 bail
hearing in federal court in San Diego that Elgindy might have had
advance warning of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--a charge his
lawyer called "racial profiling" and one Elgindy calls "very, very
sleazy."</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview from jail over the weekend, he contended
that the Sept. 11 questions were raised only because "of my
birthplace, my name, the color of my skin."</TE>
<TE>   By his own estimate, Elgindy has made a fortune over the years
selling stocks short, the legal but oft-reviled strategy of selling
borrowed shares in hopes of making a profit by buying them back
cheaper should the stock decline.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, his use of Internet sites--which charged subscribers up to
$600 a month--to trumpet the flaws of his targeted companies made him
one of the best-known short sellers in recent years, what Wired
magazine called "the Mad Max of Wall Street."</TE>
<TE>   In one celebrated case, he urged investors to sell K-tel
International Inc. after the stock soared from $5 to $30 in April and
May 1998 on optimism about a plan to sell the company's greatest-hit
recordings over the Internet. He was right: K-tel shares quickly
plunged and were back to $6 by August 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy says all of the material he used to target
stocks--including material on criminal investigations of executives
allegedly stolen from FBI databases--were gathered from legitimate
sources.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that I've discovered I've discovered publicly," he
said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   If, as he says, Elgindy is the victim of regulators, acquaintances
and investigators offended by his outspokenness, the public record
provides clues to their hostility: a long trail of lawsuits,
embittered former associates, criminal investigations and
convictions, and disputes with the National Assn. of Securities
Dealers while at brokerages in San Diego and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy, whose family moved from Egypt to the Chicago area when he
was 3, studied briefly at the University of Southern California,
worked as a car salesman in San Diego, then gravitated to the more
lucrative brokerage business.</TE>
<TE>   His first such job in 1988 was with the notorious "penny stock"
firm Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co. He maintains he left the firm--nicknamed
"blind 'em and rob 'em" by burned investors--after learning it
specialized in promoting worthless small stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy contended that exposure to unsavory practices at Blinder
and at other small brokerages paved the way for him to become an
informant for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FBI and
other federal agencies. "I have given the government hundreds if not
thousands of tips on Wall Street frauds," he claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy said he became an informant in 1994 in return for immunity
from prosecution for his role in a stock-promotion kickback case. The
informant deal was made public in May 2000 as he was sentenced to
four months in prison after pleading guilty to insurance fraud.</TE>
<TE>   At the sentencing hearing in Fort Worth, strikingly divergent
portraits emerged of Elgindy. His wife, Mary Faith, the daughter of a
Tennessee Baptist minister, said her husband was a devoted father to
their three sons, the oldest of whom has attention deficit disorder
and Tourette's syndrome. Other defense witnesses described Elgindy as
an outright savior to dozens of Kosovo refugee families, saying he
raised more than $48,000, helped them move to America and provided
housing, cars and clothing after they arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, portrayed Elgindy as a repeated liar who,
they hinted, may have pocketed some donations intended for the
victims of Kosovo atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy also has had several run-ins with securities regulators.
In a 1992 NASD arbitration action, Elgindy's mother, anesthesiologist
Laila I. Gomaa, accused Elgindy and his AMR Securities Inc. of making
unauthorized trades in her pension account. She ultimately was
awarded $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, NASD censured and fined him $30,000 for numerous alleged
violations of securities rules. A year later, NASD records show, the
group revoked his registration for failing to pay a fine and barred
him from the brokerage business, although Elgindy says he resigned
from the NASD in protest over mistreatment.</TE>
<TE>   In his latest and most serious predicament, Elgindy categorically
denies wrongdoing, offering explanations for charges in the
indictment, such as payments totaling $30,425 to then-FBI agent
Jeffrey A. Royer in exchange for information. He also responded to
the government's questions about whether he had foreknowledge of the
Sept.11 attacks and about his later wiring of a large sum to Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The payments to Royer allegedly were made by Derrick W. Cleveland,
identified in the indictment as a short seller "who assisted"
Elgindy. But Elgindy said he was never involved in any payments that
may have been made and described Cleveland as just a subscriber who
was never on his payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my understanding that they [Cleveland and Royer] were
school friends," said Elgindy, suggesting the funds Cleveland
allegedly transferred to the FBI agent might have been intended to
help Royer pay debts.</TE>
<TE>   As for the issue of advance knowledge of Sept. 11, Elgindy
acknowledged sending at least $600,000 to Lebanon during the fall. He
said he wanted his sons to spend several months a year in the Middle
East to stay in touch with their heritage, and he transferred the
funds so he could set up an office and buy a car and a seaside condo
in Lebanon for the family to use on those visits.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy also acknowledged having made large bets that stocks would
decline around the time of the attacks. But as a longtime short
seller, he said it was typical for him to have large short positions,
and that none of his short positions were in stocks that would have
been particularly affected by the attacks, such as online travel
agencies or securities tied to New York real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Muller of the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which
brought the case, declined to comment on Elgindy's statements.</TE>
<TE>   While Elgindy sits in jail awaiting a Thursday extradition
hearing, flags of the United States, California and Egypt still fly
at Elgindy's estate in Encinitas' rural Olivenhain district, which
the Elgindys bought last year for $2.2million, taking on a
$1.5-million mortgage, San Diego County property records show.</TE>
<TE>   The estate includes an elaborate faux-rock pool that he told his
Internet subscribers cost $300,000--part of a lifestyle that featured
sumptuous parties and a circle of acquaintances that, according to a
published report, included actor Verne Troyer, Dr. Evil's diminutive
clone Mini-Me in "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me."</TE>
<TE>   On May 22, a Wednesday, Elgindy's neighbors watched authorities
truck away a Bentley, a Ferrari, a Jaguar, a Humvee and a limo as
suspected ill-gotten gains. Just the previous Saturday night, Elgindy
had thrown a party to celebrate the completion of his mansion.</TE>

<HD>Guadalajara Struggling in Tech Slump</HD>
<DH>Latin America: The global economy and labor competition
from other countries stand in the way of the region's attempt to
reinvent itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUADALAJARA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Dubbed Silicon Valley South for its flowering of high-technology
companies in the 1990s, Guadalajara is drooping these days, having
lost 18,000 jobs, several marquee companies and hundreds of millions
in investment over the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   The region is struggling mightily to reinvent itself, with private
industry and the state government of Jalisco teaming up to try to
attract "value-added" systems design and software companies to
replace the scores of vanished assembly operations.</LD>
<LD>   There have even been scattered successes, including IBM Corp.'s
recent decision to double its staffing here to 1,200 by 2004 and
Intel Corp.'s commitment to upgrade its Guadalajara office as a
stand-alone research and development center where its current staff
of 50 could multiply 10 times in the next several years.</LD>
<TE>   But economists warn it will take years to recapture the jobs and
critical mass of companies that were abundant here as recently as
1999.</TE>
<TE>   What's clobbered Jalisco are the same factors that have hit
computer, Internet and telecommunications firms around the world:
overcapacity and a recession in the United States and other countries
that has severely dampened consumers' and businesses' appetite for
new gear and services.</TE>
<TE>   Among the companies that have fled or downsized are
Hewlett-Packard Co., NEC Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., Solectron
Corp., Flextronics International Ltd. and VTech Holdings Ltd. The
latter two are so-called contract manufacturers that assemble
products or components for larger name brands. Guadalajara became a
center for such operations in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The exodus is a sharp reversal of economic fortune for
Guadalajara. The city in southwestern Mexico, with the population of
8 million, slowly had been building a high-technology base since the
1970s, when Eastman Kodak Co., Burroughs Corp. and Motorola Inc.
arrived. Prodded by federal law, the companies increasingly turned to
local suppliers and technical workers to get their jobs done.</TE>
<TE>   The base expanded with the North American Free Trade Agreement and
the devaluation of the peso in 1994, which made Guadalajara more
attractive to high-tech companies that not only relocated big
operations here but brought suppliers with them, said Carlos Alba, a
sociologist at Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Companies grew so fast that labor became scarce. Just two years
ago, employers were sending buses 70 miles outside of town to fetch
prospective workers. Industrial space was being snapped up as it was
built.</TE>
<TE>   Now there is a glut of real estate, labor is plentiful and service
companies such as customs and transportation firms are struggling to
survive.</TE>
<TE>   High tech hasn't completely vanished. Guadalajara still is
responsible for some highly recognized products. IBM makes laptop
computers here and Flextronics assembles Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox. The
value of the region's exports last year, at $10.5 billion, was about
the same as the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   But the situation in the trenches is grimmer than the figures
suggest. Current high-tech employment of 64,000 is off 21% from the
peak.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most alarming statistic apart from the job losses is
the sharp reduction in business investment in Jalisco, which dropped
from a peak of $742 million in 1998 to $179.9 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The damage from the slump is being shared by all the support
industries, from injection-mold plastics to metal stamping, all the
companies that are directly related to the production at these
plants," said Juan Jose Palacios, an economist at the University of
Guadalajara.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time as the region is coping with a global tech
slowdown, it is being forced to compete against other, lower-cost
labor centers for manufacturing jobs. Mexico has been hurt by the
relative strength of the peso, which has worked to make its labor
increasingly expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of the jobs that Guadalajara has lost in the last three
years have fled to China, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, Brazil
and other developing nations boasting lower labor costs and higher
productivity, government officials here acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Especially hard hit have been the companies in Guadalajara that
assembled consumer products such as cell phones, pagers, printers and
electronic pocket organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Delgado Ayala, Jalisco's deputy secretary for economic
development and an entrepreneur with a Stanford graduate degree, says
he has no illusions about the chances of those assembly jobs coming
back to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening in Asia is making it necessary for us to
transform ourselves from a low-cost center to a value-added center of
manufacturing," Delgado Ayala said. "We hope to see the exit of
operations like the assembly of telephones and pagers replaced by
much more sophisticated design software and specialized labor."</TE>
<TE>   To make Guadalajara and environs a more attractive place for those
sorts of companies, the state is pushing technical education and
promoting communication among the companies that remain to improve
local outsourcing. The area has more than 30 universities and
technical schools and a solid infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   But in trying to capture software designing and engineering jobs,
the region has a different set of competitors, including Ireland and
Scotland, that offer infrastructure and language advantages.</TE>
<TE>   "The efforts of the state government are well-intentioned but are
subject to the reality that 95% of the capital invested in Jalisco is
foreign," Palacios said. "Virtually every plant forms part of a
multinational company. And the strategies on a corporate level are
subject to influences much stronger than the economic development
policies of the state."</TE>

<HD>Aer Lingus Gives Nod to Labor Settlement</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Proposed deal from Ireland's Labor Relations
Commission follows pilots' strike that grounded all flights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN</DL>
<LD>The management of Aer Lingus Group on Sunday said it would accept a
proposal meant to end a labor standoff that has grounded the
carrier's entire fleet.</LD>
<LD>   The pilots union did not immediately respond to the plan offered
by Ireland's Labor Relations Commission, which is trying to help end
the bitter and costly dispute.</LD>
<LD>   A one-day strike by pilots on Thursday over changes to their
working hours has escalated, and Aer Lingus canceled all flights
until Tuesday at the earliest.</LD>
<TE>   The airline is losing $1.9 million every day the fleet is grounded
and more than 100,000 travelers have been affected by the
cancellations.</TE>
<TE>   Trade union Siptu, representing ground staff, has warned that the
dispute could destroy the airline, and tourism and business
executives have issued dire warnings for Ireland's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Airline management and the pilots union agreed Sunday to receive
recommendations from the labor commission after a hearing in Dublin's
Labor Court ended in the early hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Having considered the recommendation in full, Aer Lingus has
indicated its acceptance to the court that implementation of this
recommendation will meet in full the objectives of the survival
plan," the airline said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots union made no immediate comment, and a call to the
union's office went unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   News reports said the proposed settlement included limits on the
number of times the airline could order pilots to fly after rest
periods of only 10 hours and also contained other rules on days off,
early duty and in-flight rest.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal reportedly required the pilots to accept other
elements of the airline's survival plan. The airline, like most
others, suffered heavy financial losses after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>

<HD>Airline Industry Needs to Downsize, Analysts Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Airline chief executives, meeting Sunday as a group for the first
time since the Sept. 11 attacks, face further losses on top of last
year's $17 billion unless they shrink the industry by a third,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   British Airways, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and other major
carriers won't return to profitability by trying to fill their planes
and win market share with low ticket prices as they are now, said
Chris Tarry, an airline analyst at Commerzbank.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a simple issue of supply and demand, but it's one that
airlines have failed to address for 50 years," Tarry said. "This is
an industry that's been suffering from mass delusion about
productivity and costs."</LD>
<TE>   The airline industry's profit margin averaged just 3% from 1947 to
2000, even before the Sept. 11 attacks cut air travel by a third and
led to losses that were greater than all the profit ever generated by
airlines in the history of flying.</TE>
<TE>   While carriers are working to reduce costs to cope with the fall
in demand, firing more than 10% of staff worldwide, they need to
embrace fundamental change, said Rigas Doganis, an industry
consultant and former chief executive of Greece's Olympic Airways.</TE>
<TE>   "The traditional airline network model isn't sustainable," Doganis
said. "It's overextended. The big airlines need to reduce their
short-haul operations and the smaller ones need to cut back on
long-haul flying."</TE>
<TE>   By reducing capacity in this way, carriers will be able to halt a
decline in prices that's steadily eroding their average yield, or
revenue per seat, and undermining their efforts to make a profit,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The gathering of industry chief executives at the International
Air Transport Assn.'s annual meeting in Shanghai is seeking to
address how carriers can develop their responses to the environment
left by the attacks, said Doganis, who will chair one of the
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The industry needs to be reduced by at least 30% in terms of
seating capacity to achieve sustainable profits, said Tarry, the
Commerzbank analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Fares have fallen so much that the price of a 1,000-mile flight
within Europe 10 years ago is the same as a seat across the Atlantic
today. The reduction has meant that profits are no longer assured
even when times are good, said Tarry, who predicts airlines will have
combined losses of at least $10 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Excess capacity might be eliminated by consolidation, though
government regulations now restrict mergers mainly to carriers from
the same country. British Airways' repeated attempts to take over KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines have stumbled on the rules restricting access to
airports worldwide to national carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The International Air Transport Assn.'s outgoing director general,
Pierre Jeanniot, has told airlines they can't blame their situation
entirely on Sept. 11. Even before the attacks the industry had been
expected to post a $2.5-billion loss last year.</TE>
<TE>   "CFOs should have been more vigilant and insisted on more actions
being taken to prepare for the storm," he said.</TE>

<HD>Fingerprint Scan Spurs Debate</HD>
<DH>Technology: Program's database is linked to credit or debit
cards. Customers weigh privacy concerns, convenience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN JUNG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Christopher Conrad cuts off telemarketers on the phone, regularly
reminds direct-mail associations to keep him off their lists and
diligently opts out of mass e-mail lists.</LD>
<LD>   But the Seattle commercial photographer didn't hesitate to give
his fingerprint, credit card information and phone number to a
company he had never heard of.</LD>
<LD>   Conrad is one of the 2,000-plus customers of a Thriftway grocery
store in West Seattle who signed up in a pilot program run by
Oakland, Calif.-based Indivos Corp. that links customers'
fingerprints with their credit or debit cards, allowing them to buy
groceries by running a finger over a scanner.</LD>
<TE>   "I always leave my wallet in the car or forget it in another pair
of pants," Conrad said. "It doesn't feel so much like an invasion of
privacy but more like a convenience."</TE>
<TE>   Privacy advocates and others are questioning whether the lure of
convenience outweighs the vulnerabilities of the technology and fears
of privacy intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   "With most of these applications there's an interesting starting
point, and then there are new applications and pretty soon you have
full force Big Brother watching over you," said Marc Rotenberg,
executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a public-interest research group.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there are no federal laws regarding the sale of
fingerprint databases and information.</TE>
<TE>   Indivos Chief Executive Phil Gioia said his company signed a
contract with Thriftway not to sell that information to marketing
companies. But Lee Tien, senior staff attorney for San
Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, says the technology
raises such novel and sticky legal issues as who owns the actual
fingerprint.</TE>
<TE>   Thriftway's pilot program has nevertheless proved popular from its
May 1 adoption, said store owner Paul Kapioski.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them walked right in the door and said, 'Where is it?
Let me sign up,'" Kapioski said. He said representatives from other
grocery stores in the area have come in to look at the program.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, some Kroger Co. stores use technology from an Indivos
rival, Biometrics Access Corp. Ron Smith, Biometrics Access chief
executive, says it is helping Kroger also cut down on check fraud.</TE>
<TE>   And McDonald's in Fresno, Calif., used Indivos' technology for a
brief pilot program but decided to discontinue it, said spokeswoman
Lisa Howard. McDonald's Corp. is exploring other cashless electronic
payment alternatives, such as radio transponder wands.</TE>
<TE>   At the Thriftway, customers scan one finger five times to get an
accurate image, which is then digitized and stored in Indivos'
database. The customer also registers a bank account, credit card,
debit card or even food-stamp account and a seven-digit number, such
as a phone number, which will be used to help pinpoint that
fingerprint's location among the thousands in the database.</TE>
<TE>   Then, customers can simply scan their finger at checkout counters
and enter the seven-digit number. The scanner picks up 10 or 12
points on the finger at random, compresses that down to a 300-byte
package and shoots it over an encrypted connection to the database in
Oakland for comparison with the stored fingerprint.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, it's not a huge time savings over credit-card
transactions. The customer still needs to punch in the seven-digit
number. And they still have to sign a receipt for credit card
transactions or enter another personal identification number for a
debit card purchase.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Exports Likely to Gain From Peso's Fall</HD>
<DH>Economy: Devaluation makes goods more affordable abroad.
Some experts say the currency still is too strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>One of the world's strongest currencies against the dollar in 2001,
Mexico's peso has lost 7% of its value since early April partly
because of the U.S. dollar's comparable slide and because of a policy
shift by the central bank to favor a weaker currency.</LD>
<LD>   A prime beneficiary of the currency slide, however, could be
Mexico's export manufacturers, whose goods had become less
competitive as the peso strengthened. A strong peso, combined with
the U.S. recession, last year caused tens of thousands of jobs to be
lost in maquiladoras, the Mexican assembly plants clustered along the
U.S.-Mexico border geared to export markets.</LD>
<LD>   A weakening peso could boost demand for export products by making
them cheaper in foreign markets.</LD>
<TE>   Further devaluation of the peso may be ahead. Economist Enrique
Dussel Peters of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in
Mexico City believes that the peso is still as much as 30%
overvalued.</TE>
<TE>   What is certain is that there is a lot less demand for the peso
now than a year ago, a factor that inevitably diminishes its value on
international markets.</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners are less eager to buy Mexican stocks, bonds and money
market accounts today than a year ago, and foreign companies'
interest in establishing businesses here has cooled.</TE>
<TE>   Net foreign investment in stocks and bonds was $147.4 million
during the first quarter, down 73% from the $555.7 million invested
during the same three months in 2001, said Jonathan Heath, an
economist with LatinSource in Mexico City. Foreign direct investment
in Mexican businesses was $2.73 billion, about $300 million less than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the peso closed at 9.65 to the dollar, compared with
9.00 in early April. Last week, the peso traded as low as 9.77 to the
dollar, its weakest close in 15 months. Mexican stocks also have
slid. The main stock index closed Friday at 7,031.64, down 4.5% on
the week and 6% since the end of April.</TE>
<TE>   The decline of the peso shows how Mexico's currency and economy
are increasingly synchronized to those of the United States. The
peso's weakening since April is roughly equal to that by the dollar
in relation to the euro over the same period, said Guillermo
Estebanez, a currency strategist with Bank of America in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "As the peso strengthened last year it was seen as a bet on the
U.S. recovery, that there would be a very short recession with a
sharp rebound. But that bullish outlook has started to unravel and
the markets now have more doubts," Estebanez said.</TE>
<TE>   While the peso remained strong it wreaked havoc on Mexico's
all-important export manufacturing industry, making the country's
maquiladoras and other factories less competitive in the global
economy.</TE>
<TE>   But even now, economists here increasingly are worried that
Mexican factories are not recapturing the tens of thousands of lost
jobs, even though the U.S. economy is improving and creating greater
demand.</TE>
<TE>   "The maquila sector seems to be in a lot of trouble," Heath said,
adding that jobs lost in Mexico since the U.S. recession started may
have moved to lower-cost countries such as China and Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   These troubles are what may have spurred the central bank in early
April to take actions that increased liquidity in Mexico's money
supply and made credit more available, but at the cost of higher
inflation and a devalued currency.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a signaling mechanism," Damian Fraser, a UBS Warburg
analyst in Mexico City, said of the move. "The bank has described the
peso's decline as an 'orderly decline.' The markets took that as a
positive description, that the bank was comfortable with it" and
would allow the currency to devalue.</TE>
<TE>   Heath of LatinSource said the peso could rebound over the course
of the year if the U.S. recovery reverberates here. So far it hasn't.
Although the U.S. economy grew by more than 5% during the first
quarter, the Mexican economy contracted by 0.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Estebanez said he thinks the peso will devalue further, but he
agrees its future ultimately is tied to the U.S. dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "The dollar is still under pressure. There is less appetite abroad
for U.S. assets, less money flowing into the United States this year.
When the dollar goes up, the peso goes up. Now that the dollar is
weakening, so is the peso," Estebanez said.</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices Expected to Fall for Second Year</HD>
<DH>Survey: Slower-than- expected economic growth to hurt
demand; meanwhile, Norway and Russia lift sales limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Oil prices will fall for a second year in 2002 as non-OPEC nations
pump more and the world's economies grow less than expected, hurting
demand, according to a Bloomberg survey of 35 analysts, traders and
investors.</LD>
<LD>   Brent crude oil in London, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world's trades, this year will average around $23 a barrel, little
changed from the average through May, the survey said. That's down
6.7% from 2001 and below the year-earlier record of $28.53 for the
13-year-old contract.</LD>
<LD>   "There are signals that cast some doubts on the economic
recovery," said Roberto Sieber, head of market analysis and chief
economist for Shell Transport &amp; Trading Co., part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group. He declined to give a forecast.</LD>
<TE>   The European Commission last week trimmed its estimate for growth
for the second month, and analysts expect an expansion of the U.S.
economy will slow from the first quarter. A lack of growth in oil
consumption has forced the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries to slash oil output to the lowest level since the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices have dropped 17% over the last year after recessions in
the U.S., Europe and Japan reduced energy use. September's attacks on
the U.S. further undermined growth, slashing the number of people
flying and delaying the recovery.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster prices, OPEC reduced sales four times in a year, the
latest taking effect on Jan. 1, and secured the cooperation of five
rivals to limit supplies. That accord ends this month.</TE>
<TE>   A recovery from a two-year low in crude prices in November has
come in part because of violence between Israel and the Palestinians
and traders' concern about an attack on Iraq, the third-largest
Middle East oil producer.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for oil this year will rise at half the average rate of the
1990s, after last year posting the smallest gain in two decades,
according to estimates from the International Energy Agency. A recent
reduction in Mideast violence has depressed prices, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's ending of its cooperation with OPEC will increase
supplies and further undermine prices. On May 17, the prime minister,
Mikhail M. Kasyanov, said the world's second-largest producer will
end cooperation with the oil exporters group and "export as much oil
as we can."</TE>
<TE>   Norway followed its European rival and said it plans to lift its
sales restrictions at the end of June, further undermining oil
prices, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is predicting the lowest price of $20 a
barrel for the year. Based on trading so far, that implies about
$16.80 for the second half.</TE>

<HD>Occidental Buys 24.5% Stake in Dolphin Energy</HD>
<DH>Deals: L.A. firm, aiming for Mideast growth, pays $310
million for share in Emirates company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates</DL>
<LD>Occidental Petroleum Corp. on Sunday acquired a 24.5% stake in
Dolphin Energy Ltd., an Emirates-based company previously held by
Enron Corp., the official news agency WAM reported.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Oxy paid $310 million in cash to become the
United Arab Emirates' second partner in Dolphin Energy, beating four
other multinationals in the race.</LD>
<LD>   "Occidental won by a huge margin," said Ahmed al-Sayegh, a member
of the boards of DEL and UOG, the state investment arm that is the
majority owner. "There was no way anyone could compete with
Occidental's offer."</LD>
<TE>   According to the Middle East Economic Survey, Oxy's bid was about
$100 million more than an offer by BP, first runner-up in the
contest.</TE>
<TE>   Dolphin is a perfect fit for Occidental's strategy to expand in
the Middle East, Occidental Chief Executive Ray Irani said.</TE>
<TE>   "Dolphin offers an opportunity not only to implement the project
as it is currently envisaged, it provides an opportunity to cooperate
in the energy field in the region," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal gives Occidental a share equal to that of France's
TotalFinaElf, while UOG holds the remainder.</TE>
<TE>   "Having Occidental as a third partner will help smooth the process
and bring capital into it," Sayegh said.</TE>
<TE>   Dolphin plans to build a pipeline to channel 2 billion cubic feet
per day of Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Enron previously had held the stake and sold it back to the state
group for an undisclosed sum a year ago, long before the
Houston-based energy trader's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Occidental rose 9cents to $29.86 on Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Fee-Based Networks Making a Connection</HD>
<DH>Internet: Upstarts tout peer-to-peer technology as way for
clients to offer digital goods, for a price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before it ran afoul of the courts, Napster Inc. taught more than 70
million consumers that "peer to peer" meant copying whatever they
wanted from other people's computers without paying for it.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since, a small but growing band of upstarts has been trying
to teach a new lesson: that peer-to-peer networking is a better way
for businesses to send music, videos and other digital goods through
the Internet. And no one has to receive anything free.</LD>
<LD>   The new players range from consumer-oriented systems--including
CenterSpan Communications Corp.'s Scour and those from Wippit Ltd.,
Yaga Inc. and Blue Falcon Networks Inc.--to distribution systems
aimed at corporate customers, including Kontiki Inc. and Uprizer Inc.
In addition, Altnet Inc. is building a fee-based network on the back
of Kazaa, a free network that the record and movie companies are
suing for copyright infringement.</LD>
<TE>   Like Kazaa and other free networks, the upstarts slash the cost of
sending digital goods by transforming consumers into distributors.
Songs, movies and other files flow from user to user, with the costs
absorbed by the users' Internet providers.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that users of the new networks don't control
what gets traded on them. The only files available through these
systems are the ones approved by copyright owners.</TE>
<TE>   The ventures have attracted some blue-chip investors, but as a
group they're low on customers. That's partly because of concerns
about Napster-style piracy and partly because the record labels and
Hollywood studios have been slow to adapt their business models to
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're all willing to do deals now, but they're wary.
Too wary," Paul Myers, chief executive of London-based Wippit, said
of the major record companies. "I think they're missing huge
opportunities. They're playing into the arms of the illegal
services."</TE>
<TE>   Peer-to-peer networks are designed to solve one of the thorniest
problems in transmitting bulky audio and video files on the Internet:
The larger the audience, the higher the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike with conventional broadcasting, which uses the same
airwaves no matter how many people tune in, transmitting a file over
the Internet takes up more network capacity as the audience grows.
Everyone who watches a concert online or downloads a movie connects
separately to the supplier's Web site, so each user drives up the
amount of capacity, or bandwidth, the supplier has to pay for.</TE>
<TE>   Peer-to-peer networks, by contrast, spread files the way a case of
chicken pox spreads through a grade-school classroom. A popular song
might start on one user's computer, but each user who copies it
becomes a new source for other users.</TE>
<TE>   The network points users to the closest available source, so the
first user ultimately supports only a small portion of the total
copies. More advanced networks enable users to copy a file from
multiple sources at the same time, taking small pieces from each.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the greatest distribution mechanism for content ever
invented," said Chris Kitze, chief executive of San Francisco-based
Yaga. "You have the ability to reproduce infinitely, at almost no
cost, unlimited amounts of content, which means you never run out of
inventory."</TE>
<TE>   Though Kazaa and other free networks let users decide which files
to share with other users, the copyright-friendly upstarts don't.
Instead, network administrators decide which files can flow from user
to user. And electronic locks let copyright owners dictate how much,
if anything, people must pay for a file.</TE>
<TE>   In Blue Falcon's approach, for example, central computers ensure
that only authorized users supply and copy files. Those computers
also would provide the keys to locked files and bill users for what
they download.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about file sharing, it's file distribution," said Ian
Clarke, co-founder of Santa Monica-based Uprizer.</TE>
<TE>   That's an important distinction because corporate officials are
skittish about the whole concept of peer-to-peer networking. Mountain
View, Calif.-based Kontiki bills its services as "peer assisted," not
peer to peer, and pitches to corporate customers by saying, "Here's a
more effective way to communicate," said Mark Szelenyi, director of
enterprise marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Kontiki has about 20 customers in various stages of testing or
deployment, and they typically use the network to distribute sales
and training material and software updates, Szelenyi said. Similarly,
Uprizer focuses on helping corporations cut the cost of internal
communications, using peer-to-peer technology to distribute material
to employees and branch offices.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Falcon specializes in using peer-to-peer technology for
Webcasts, helping customers such as Radio Free Virgin, a leading
online radio network tied to Virgin Group Ltd., cut bandwidth costs
by as much as 50%. Zack Zalon, general manager of Radio Free Virgin,
said peer-to-peer techniques, better compression software and other
improvements over the next few years could enable his company to
reach up to 30 times more listeners for the same amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   There are signs that the studios and record companies are ready to
start experimenting with peer-to-peer systems. Amid pressure from the
Justice Department and burgeoning online piracy, negotiations with
tech companies have intensified, several executives at peer-to-peer
companies said.</TE>
<TE>   Wippit, a network that offers unlimited MP3 files for a flat
monthly fee, has signed up one of the five major record companies,
Myers said, although it has yet to announce which one. Hillsboro,
Ore.-based CenterSpan has acquired the rights to songs from Sony
Music's catalog, and a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal has agreed to
launch a CenterSpan-powered entertainment service, said Michael
Kassan, co-president of CenterSpan digital media and entertainment
group.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the midst of some very advanced discussions on the
video-on-demand side," Kassan said, adding that entertainment
companies' attitudes about peer-to-peer technologies have changed
dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   The music labels and film studios have been very good at promising
online initiatives, but not at delivering them. Although many have
tried, none of the companies has been able to obtain all the licenses
needed to compete with the unauthorized online networks. Nor have the
studios' video-on-demand ventures gotten off the ground--in fact, one
of the two major initiatives already has collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jay Haynes, chief executive of Blue Falcon in Los Angeles,
said he expects the labels and studios to embrace peer-to-peer
distribution soon. "In the next 12 months, I expect to see explosive
growth in on-demand [services]."</TE>
<TE>   Napster and its successors did the entertainment industry a favor,
Kitze of Yaga said, by inducing consumers to want to get music
online. "The next change in the behavior is to get from 'free' to
'paid for,'" he said.</TE>

<HD>Rambus Seeks Reversal of Ruling for Infineon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rambus Inc. will ask an appeals court today to throw out a finding
that it committed fraud in getting computer memory-chip patents and
to let it pursue infringement claims against Infineon Technologies.</LD>
<LD>   Rambus accused the German chip maker of using its patented
technology for high-speed memory chips. Instead, a U.S. district
judge dismissed the infringement claim and a jury determined that
Rambus got the patents through fraud. Rambus was ordered to pay
Infineon $350,000 in damages and more than $7 million in legal fees.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Altos-based company is asking the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent appeals, to reverse
those findings.</LD>
<TE>   The debate centers on patents for the most common type of memory
chip, known as SDRAM, and a more advanced chip developed by Rambus,
the DDR SDRAM, which is becoming the industry standard.</TE>
<TE>   Rambus also faces shareholder lawsuits accusing it of deceiving
investors about its patents, and the Federal Trade Commission is
investigating its patents.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks are set to churn sideways to higher this week as Wall Street
digests a pile of key economic data. But increasing tensions between
India and Pakistan could throw a wrench in the works.</LD>
<LD>   The Street will pick apart reports on the giant U.S. manufacturing
sector, the services sector, car sales and the crucial monthly jobs
data, all covering the month of May, plus April construction
spending.</LD>
<LD>   For the next five trading sessions, investors have slim pickings
from the earnings basket.</LD>
<TE>   Of special interest this week will be chip maker Intel Corp.,
which will give its mid-quarter update Thursday after the close.</TE>
<TE>   Before trading opens today, the Institute of Supply Management's
report on U.S. manufacturing activity during May probably will be
stronger than originally expected.</TE>
<TE>   The May employment report, due before Friday's open, is expected
to show creation of 58,000 jobs, up from April's 43,000 jobs,
according to economists polled by Reuters. The unemployment rate is
expected to rise to 6.1% in May from 6.0% in April.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Today, the Commerce Department will report on construction
spending in April.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, the Commerce Department will report on April inventories
at wholesalers.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve will report on consumer borrowing in April.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to bolster its brand with large corporations and the people
who run them, Intel Corp. this week will kick off its largest-ever
advertising campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Clara-based chip maker, which invented the
microprocessor, is seeking to build on its brand awareness with
consumers and extend it to large businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Tuesday, ads will appear in print and online. The
campaign is slated to last as long as three years, a good amount of
time for an advertising push, and will run into "the tens of millions
of dollars."</LD>
<TE>   Intel's brand is already among the most recognized in the world,
at No. 6 in 2001 with a brand value of $34.7 billion, according to
New York consultancy Interbrand Corp. The most valuable brand last
year was Coca-Cola, followed by Microsoft, IBM, General Electric and
Nokia.</TE>

<HD>Deloitte Consulting Partners to Meet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deloitte &amp; Touche's consulting partners will meet in San Francisco
this week as the second-largest accounting firm decides how to
separate its consulting business from the firm's core audit and tax
operations.</LD>
<LD>   Deloitte spokesman John L'Abate declined to comment on a published
report that partners will hear a proposal for a management buyout of
the business valued at $3.1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   "We will be talking about the operations and the administration of
the firm as we do every year," L'Abate said, noting that the meeting
of the consulting partners is an annual event.</LD>
<TE>   Deloitte said in February it would join the major accounting firms
in separating consulting from auditing to remove perceived conflicts
of interest. After the collapse of Enron Corp., which used Arthur
Andersen both as auditor and consultant, companies such as Walt
Disney Co. and Johnson &amp; Johnson said they will no longer use the
same firm to provide both types of services.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte is the last of the major accounting firms to decide on
the future of its consulting business. Ernst &amp; Young sold its
consulting unit to the French company Cap Gemini in 2000, while KPMG
spun off its business in an initial stock offering last year.
Andersen separated from its consulting business, now known as
Accenture Ltd., in 2000 and sold its remaining consulting operations
to KPMG Consulting Inc. last month.</TE>
<TE>   PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's largest accounting firm, will
sell a stake in its consulting business via an IPO in August.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Havas, whose clients include Nike Inc. and Airbus, is in talks to buy
British advertising rival Cordiant Communications Group for as much
as $1 billion, the Observer reported, citing an unidentified person.</LD>
<LD>   Havas spokesman Simon Gillham declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   Cordiant's board has welcomed the offer, which may be announced
within two weeks, the Observer said. The purchase would boost Havas'
sales by about 42% and add clients such as Nokia. Cordiant, which was
unprofitable in 2001, is worth $588 million based on Friday's closing
price.</LD>
<TE>   Pressure has been increasing on Havas to expand after French rival
Publicis Groupe  agreed to buy Bcom3 Group earlier this year to

<HD>EU to Revamp Rules on Private Pension Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>European Union governments will allow private pension funds to
operate across the 15-nation bloc, a first step in expanding the EU's
$2.3-trillion company pension market.</LD>
<LD>   Finance ministers Tuesday will permit funds to branch out across
national borders as long as they invest no more than 30% of their
assets in hedge funds or derivatives and no more than 5% in a single
security, EU officials said.</LD>
<LD>   By pooling their European pension assets, companies from BT Group
to Royal Dutch/Shell Group would each save $37 million a year, the EU
estimates. Still, the move leaves untouched a patchwork of tax
systems that will continue to hinder the pension fund industry.</LD>
<TE>   "Anything that makes the world of pensions simpler is a good
thing," said Hannah Clarke, communications manager for Unilever's
$7.9-billion pension fund. "We have a lot of people who move around
and not having a unified regulation makes their life more
complicated."</TE>
<TE>   An aging population is straining Europe's government-run
retirement systems, the European Commission says. Over the next 15
years, the population aged 65 and over will rise 22%.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's meeting in Luxembourg will produce a "political
agreement" on the outlines of the pension law. The rules require the
approval of the European Parliament.</TE>

<LD>PricewaterhouseCoopers named Greg Brenneman president and chief

PwC's board.</LD>
<TE>   Brenneman served as president and chief operating officer of
Continental Airlines Inc. between September 1995 and May 2001,
helping CEO Gordon Bethune rebuild the Houston-based carrier after

<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer are a summary of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Question: I own a $15-million scrap-metal recycling company. I
would like to double the business over the next five years, but I'm
already working 70 hours a week and don't see how I could take on any
more. How do you run a successful business and have a life at the
same time?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: The answer lies in your question. The key is to actually
run the business (i.e., manage it) rather than trying to do
everything yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the fact that you're already working 70 hours a week, it
sounds like you may have a problem with the dreaded "D"
word--delegation. Until you learn to do this essential managerial
activity well, your company can never grow beyond the limits of your
own capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The place to start, suggests Karen Good, president of EDP Systems
in Irvine, is with an honest assessment of your management style. Do
you delegate or abdicate? Do you allow people to make mistakes or do
you come down hard on failure, so that nobody in your organization
will take a risk? Do you have a strong need for control, or can you
allow people to do things their way as long as they produce the
results you want? Above all, do you constantly solve problems for
everyone or do you encourage people to come up with solutions on
their own?</TE>
<TE>   As long as you remain the designated CAP--Chief Answer Person,
says Good, your people have no reason to figure things out on their
own.</TE>
<TE>   Next, says Bob Dabic, chief executive of DabiCoaching in Newport
Beach, look at how you spend your time. Do you invest it in
high-level CEO activities--such as setting the vision, crafting the
strategy and focusing on market opportunities--or do you spend the
entire day in the trenches putting out tactical and operational
fires? More important, do you take on tasks that you have hired
others to do because you don't like the way they get things done?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, take some time to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses
of your management team. Do your managers have the experience,
knowledge and skills to take on much of what you do, thereby helping
the company grow? Or have they gone as far within the company as
their limited skills will allow? Sooner or later, most entrepreneurs
have to make the tough decision to let loyal people go simply because
they're holding the company back. In order to expand your business,
you may have to face this issue as well.</TE>
<TE>   If you're serious about expanding the company while reducing your
workload to a more manageable level, says Steve Driscol, president of
Thermal-Vac Technology in Orange, the first step involves identifying
your strengths and weaknesses and delegating the functions and
activities in which you don't excel.</TE>
<TE>   "One approach would be to bring in an experienced general manager
who can take over the daily operations," he said. "This would free
you up to focus on the things that you do best while putting the
company in capable hands. Or you could divide up the tasks you
currently perform and hire a competent manager in each of those
functional areas. It might take a year to find and hire the right
people, but with a strong management team in place, you can cut back
on your hours and focus on growing the company rather than managing
the day-to-day stuff."</TE>
<TE>   David La Montagne, president of Vessel Assist Assn. of America in
Newport Beach, supports the idea of hiring a general manager or chief
operating officer, but only under certain conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "First, make sure you clearly outline the role you want the person
to perform and your expectations for the position," he advised.
"Provide specific, measurable goals and objectives, and put them in
writing. It also helps to identify the resources the person will have
available--budgets, spending capacity, etc.--so they have a good idea
of what they have to work with.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition, identify the level of power and authority the person
will have at their command. If they want to exceed that level, they
must consult with you before making any decisions, giving orders or
taking action. Above all, make it crystal clear to your people they
can't come running to you with problems and issues once the general
manager is in place. Otherwise, you will undermine the GM's role and
end up taking back everything you delegated."</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that you can run a business and have a life at
the same time--as long as you learn to let go and trust the people
you hired to do the job. Of course, you can choose to maintain the
status quo and work yourself into exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   Or, you can learn to get results through others and enjoy the
fruits of your labors. The choice is yours.</TE>

<HD>Napster May File for Chapter 11 Protection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Napster Inc., the Internet music-swapping service shut down in a
dispute with record companies, may seek bankruptcy protection in
Delaware as early as today as part of a proposed $8-million buyout,
people familiar with the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   A Chapter 11 filing would allow Napster to be bought by
Bertelsmann, Germany's biggest media company, and reorganize under
current management, the people said. The proposed acquisition,
requiring a bankruptcy judge's approval, doesn't rule out the
possibility of a better offer at auction before the deal is
completed.</LD>
<LD>   Bertelsmann said on May 17 it agreed to buy the online music
company from Napster's creditors. Former Napster Chief Executive
Konrad Hilbers would rejoin the company and co-founder Shawn Fanning
would be chief technology officer, Bertelsmann said.</LD>
<TE>   Napster, once used by millions to swap music online, has been
entangled in copyright litigation with five record companies since
1999.</TE>

<HD>Charter Offering Two HDTV Networks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playing catch-up to satellite TV and rival Time Warner Cable, Charter
Communications Inc. has begun carrying two high-definition television
networks on its cable TV systems in five markets, including parts of
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The beneficiaries are the relatively small percentage of viewers
with HDTV sets, which typically cost $1,500 or more. Those
households, though, are hotly contested by cable and satellite
operators because they tend to spend heavily on TV programming.</LD>
<LD>   The only HDTV channels in Charter's initial lineup are the
high-definition versions of HBO and Showtime.</LD>
<TE>   The company is in negotiations with affiliates of the major
broadcast networks, spokesman Andy Morgan said, and it hopes to add
local stations that provide a "significant or substantial" amount of
HDTV.</TE>
<TE>   The five systems where Charter has launched HDTV serve the
Glendale-Burbank, Pasadena-Alhambra, suburban Dallas, Miami Beach and
Birmingham, Ala., areas.</TE>
<TE>   Satellite operators DirecTV and DishNetwork offer several national
HDTV channels. The most extensive offering may come from AOL Time
Warner Inc. subsidiary Time Warner Cable, which carries both national
and local HDTV programming on many of its systems, including most of
the areas it serves in Southern California.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. will shut down during
the week of July 4 to save money.</LD>
<LD>   About 74,000 U.S. employees of Hewlett-Packard will be off work
from June 30 to July 6, spokeswoman Judy Radlinsky said.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett-Packard previously has closed during economic slowdowns,
she said. Sun, closing on the same days, also shut down for a week
last year during the period, spokeswoman Diane Carlini said.</LD>
<TE>   Both companies have reported declining sales in recent quarters as
the computer industry has slowed. Hewlett-Packard is planning to fire
15,000 employees as it merges its businesses with those of Compaq
Computer Corp., which it acquired for $18.9 billion on May 3.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The group that oversees the Internet's traffic system moved closer to
a complete overhaul over the weekend when a committee recommended
changes aimed at making the organization function more smoothly.</LD>
<LD>   A committee set up by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers recommended that the group retool its internal structure
and change how corporate directors are chosen, but rejected a
proposal to bring governments on board.</LD>
<LD>   The committee, which consists of four of ICANN's 19 directors,
emphasized that its report did not represent the official views of
the entire ICANN board. But the report came out five days after the
committee met privately with the other directors to come up with a
rough consensus over how the global body should operate in the
future.</LD>
<TE>   The committee asked for public feedback and said it hoped to
approve a reform plan when ICANN next meets in Romania at the end of
June.</TE>

<HD>Chips Likely to Bring Down PC Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLINE HUMER</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Personal computers, which any savvy shopper can pick up on the
Internet for as little as $600, may shortly become even cheaper.</LD>
<LD>   Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. slashed prices on
microprocessors, making it possible for PC makers to cut prices and
potentially spur demand in the doggedly weak PC market.</LD>
<LD>   "Historically, that's why PC prices have dropped every year--[PC
manufacturers] passing those component prices through and hopefully
maintaining gross margin," said Barry Jaruzelski, a managing partner
in the global technology practice at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in
New York.</LD>
<TE>   PC prices fell in 2001 amid a price war led by Dell Computer
Corp., which used its direct-sales business model to gain market
share and maintain profit while its competitors booked losses trying
to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   Demand from corporations and consumers weakened in 2001 because of
the economic and technology spending decline and as PC buyers began
replacing computers less frequently.</TE>
<TE>   As Dell cut prices, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Gateway Inc. tried to
keep up, lowering prices in an effort to retain market share and spur
overall demand.</TE>
<TE>   This year, prices have remained low, although research firm
Gartner Dataquest said prices increased slightly in the first quarter
from the fourth quarter, when companies cut prices to jump-start
holiday sales.</TE>
<TE>   But demand for PCs is off from the end of last year. HP said
recently that consumer demand dropped off as its fiscal second
quarter ended April 30.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of continued weak demand, the Intel cuts and stable
pricing of other components such as memory, lower PC prices are
likely, analysts agreed. And the first company they said will take
advantage of the cuts is Dell, which has low inventories and a direct
line to its customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The way [Dell] benefits is that they have less inventory," said
Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff. "If I cut the price today, I'm
going to get your business because I'm going to be going up against
somebody else at a higher price."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, competitors such as HP that use distributors
and sell their PCs to consumers through computer stores have weeks of
inventories of PCs built with more expensive chips that they need to
sell.</TE>

<HD>Netscape Browser Isn't All That New</HD>
<DH>Internet: Version 7.0 fixes the bugs of the previous one
but mostly showcases its connection to AOL Time Warner and its
subsidiaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW FORDAHL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long after Microsoft's Internet Explorer won the browser wars, AOL's
Netscape Communications division is launching another volley in its
battle to stay relevant.</LD>
<LD>   Netscape 7, now available for downloading as a preview release, is
more defensive than offensive: It fixes the bugs and improves on the
speed of its predecessor while adding features others already have.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say that Netscape has nothing new to offer. Like no
other browser can, it closely integrates services and content from
the AOL Time Warner conglomerate, including instant messaging, music
and news.</LD>
<TE>   But ultimately, a browser is just a browser.</TE>
<TE>   You download pages, click on links and look at pages. It's good if
it doesn't crash. Better still if it makes Net surfing at least seem
faster. Better yet if it doesn't attract worms like a dog does fleas.</TE>
<TE>   Browsers are now evolving like word processors. New releases are
greeted with more yawns than cheers as developers pile on more mostly
unused bells and whistles.</TE>
<TE>   That's a far cry from the mid-1990s, when users eagerly awaited
the next release of Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Back
then, basic functionality was still being defined and refined.</TE>
<TE>   Now, users have a good idea of what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft--legally or illegally--built its browser into its
operating system, and most users find that it works well enough.</TE>
<TE>   And after America Online bought Netscape in 1998, the company
seemed to give up as the flagship AOL service continued to use
Internet Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Netscape has about 7% of the browser market, compared with
Explorer's 91% share, according to WebSideStory's StatMarket, a
research firm.</TE>
<TE>   The Netscape 7.0 preview, a free download that works on Windows,
Mac and Linux systems, looks like version 6.0 but fixes bugs, starts
faster and renders pages more accurately than its predecessor. A
final version is expected this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The browser window is very clean, though it can quickly fill up
screen real estate with tabs and other features.</TE>
<TE>   A "Sidebar" column, which fills up a bit less than a quarter of
the browser screen, contains tabs for news, shopping, movies and
music, bookmarks, maps, directions and buddy lists. Many of those
features can be found on many Web portals, including Yahoo. There is
some convenience in having it readily available, but for the most
part it's about selling AOL Time Warner or its partners.</TE>
<TE>   Netscape 7.0 also incorporates AOL Instant Messenger for real-time
chat.</TE>
<TE>   And it borrows heavily from other players in the browser world: A
new download manager is basically a list of downloads in progress.
Users of Internet Explorer for the Mac will be familiar with this.</TE>
<TE>   The mail program runs like any other. It does make searching for
specific messages faster by using "Quick Search" fields.</TE>
<TE>   New-mail notification also is improved. When a message is
received, a small window pops up in the lower right corner of the
screen, just like Microsoft's Windows Messenger alerts.</TE>

<HD>Acting on His Vision for Gaming</HD>
<DH>Robert 'Bobby' Kotick leads Activision's growth as he
builds on industry's gaining momentum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few companies can chart the financial fluctuations of the video game
industry over the last 20 years as well as Activision Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Founded in 1979, Activision rode the Atari wave until the
mid-1980s, when Atari crashed, causing many to conclude that video
games were a fad. With the market much diminished, Activision filed
for bankruptcy in 1991. That year, a cocky 27-year-old entrepreneur,
Robert "Bobby" Kotick, bought a controlling stake in Activision,
reorganized the company and moved it from the Bay Area to Santa
Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Although the ride has been bumpy at times, Kotick recently has
become the darling of Wall Street after releasing a streak of hit
game titles, including "Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3," "Return to Castle
Wolfenstein" and "Spider-Man."</LD>
<TE>   With a market valuation of $1.8 billion, $280 million in cash and
$786 million in annual sales, Activision has become the
second-largest independent video game publisher in the United States
after Electronic Arts Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. Part of
Activision's growth came from aggressive acquisitions. The company
spent $47.2 million in the last eight months alone purchasing four
game companies.</TE>
<TE>   Boosting Activision's--and the industry's--momentum is the
proliferation of Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2, introduced in 2000, and
Nintendo Co.'s GameCube and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox consoles, which
launched last holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   Kotick, now 39, spoke a week after the Electronic Entertainment
Expo, the industry's largest trade show.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Size up the console war.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The numbers speak for themselves. Microsoft and Nintendo
are fighting it out for second place. Sony is presently the leader.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does that affect you as a software publisher?</TE>
<TE>   A: You can't ask for a better market environment. We've just had a
round of price cuts on the hardware that will drive the industry
further into the mass market. The reduction in price of the PSOne in
particular will move the platform through at least another year. That
$49 price point for the PSOne also expands our market. Now you can
take that console, and the games that go with it, to Latin America,
Asia and second-tier European countries that previously couldn't
afford the console.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will online gaming on the console be big business?</TE>
<TE>   A: Not in the near term, but it will be one of the great growth
catalysts for the next cycle. For now, you're going to see a lot of
experimentation and continued institutional learning. Look at "Tony
Hawk 3" for the PlayStation 2. It has some very nice online hooks.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are people actually playing "Tony Hawk 3" online?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yep. All 17 people who took the trouble to buy a modem for
their PS2s. This is an industry where an add-on peripheral has never
really had a lot of traction in terms of broad penetration.</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that playing games against a real person is
more fun than playing against the machine. There are a number of
other catalysts for online games. There's trial and sample. Trial and
sample in our industry is largely done through Blockbuster rentals or
borrowing from friends. If consumers have the opportunity to sample
games through digital download, the industry is likely to see greater
consumption overall.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Console games have captured most of the media attention over
the last two years. What's the future of games for the personal
computer?</TE>
<TE>   A: The PC is primarily a hobbyist's and enthusiast's platform.
When you have properties that are appropriate for that consumer, it's
a great opportunity. It's also a great place to cut your teeth on
online gaming before going into the console. We've developed a lot of
institutional expertise on the PC in online gaming. But the growth of
the PC games market will be in the small single digits. On the other
hand, it's a more stable business in a way than consoles, which go up
and down with the release of new hardware.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's your projection of this year's market growth?</TE>
<TE>   A: Overall, the marketplace will grow 12% to 17%. For Activision,
we expect to grow at the low end of that range.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why so modest?</TE>
<TE>   A: When you look at our company, we're at $786 million in revenue.
That's a big number. We're also taking into consideration slower
growth rates in Europe and a continued weak economy in the U.S. Also,
we're expecting the PC market, which constitutes 15% of our business,
to grow at single-digit rates. This also is the first year of the
console cycle. Remember, two out of three consoles just launched last
year. The mass market opportunity won't really start to kick in until
next year and the year after.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much further do you think the industry will consolidate?</TE>
<TE>   A: You haven't seen large companies merging with large companies,
or even mid-sized companies. Instead, we've seen consolidation in the
small to mid-sized companies. For us, we're doing transactions in the
$20-million to $30-million range. We've been acquiring companies that
either have great development track records or properties that are
attractive. When you look at the landscape, there's still plenty of
opportunity for us to acquire.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you seeing major media companies shop for game companies?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. The most natural buyers are the big media companies such
as Disney, AOL Time Warner, Viacom and Vivendi. They've come to
realize that games have the ability to really build value in their
intellectual properties. We're in an industry that's growing at high
double digits. Media companies realize they need to seek new areas of
opportunities for growth because their own rates of growth are slow
to none, and ours are looking pretty good.</TE>

<HD>Clock Is Ticking on United's Chance for Government Loan</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Troubled carrier hasn't decided whether to apply.
Labor concessions are crucial but unions are wary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's crunch time for United Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   With its losses mounting daily, the struggling carrier is weighing
whether to ask Uncle Sam for help in the form of a government loan
guarantee. But the deadline for applying for a guarantee is June 28,
so the unit of UAL Corp. must quickly decide before that window shuts
for good.</LD>
<LD>   Trouble is, the agency dispensing the guarantees, the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board, looks more favorably on an
airline if its stakeholders--including its labor unions--are willing
to make concessions to help the carrier recover. Although employees
own 55% of United, labor-management relations at the carrier are
contentious at best, and it's highly questionable whether they'll
reach any giveback deals with United in just four weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Air Line Pilots Assn. is holding talks with United's
executives about potential wage cuts or other concessions, the unions
for its mechanics and flight attendants are not.</TE>
<TE>   "They [United] have not proposed the specifics of a recovery plan
that's required for us to pass judgment one way or the other," said
Frank Larkin, a spokesman for the International Assn. of Machinists.</TE>
<TE>   "If your question is: 'Isn't it getting a little late?' then that
is a good question," he added.</TE>
<TE>   There aren't suggestions that United's survival depends on a loan
guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're facing a liquidity crisis in the near
term," said Raymond Neidl, an industry consultant. United has nearly
$3billion of cash on hand and $3.5billion of "unencumbered" aircraft
that it could pledge as collateral for additional loans.</TE>
<TE>   But given the sad shape of the airlines, especially United, the
credit markets and banks are demanding high costs to refinance the
carriers' existing debts and issue new loans. In United's case, those
higher borrowing costs, together with United's operating losses in
the face of the travel slump, could set back its recovery
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, United has debt payments of about $850 million that
come due later this year, which would eat up much of its cash.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working on refinancing" those debts at more favorable
terms, said United Chief Financial Officer Jake Brace, adding that a
federal loan guarantee "would improve our access to the capital
markets."</TE>
<TE>   That's if United seeks a loan guarantee. Brace wouldn't elaborate
on United's talks with employees about getting concessions before
June 28, and he said the airline is "likely to decide at the last
possible time" whether it applies for the aid.</TE>
<TE>   But the pilots' union expects United to apply, said Patrick
Palazzolo, a United captain and union spokesman. In fact, the union's
willingness to negotiate concessions "is contingent on their trying
to get the ATSB loan guarantees," he said. "That's the whole point of
us discussing this."</TE>
<TE>   United, the nation's second-largest airline behind AMR Corp.'s
American and the largest operator at Los Angeles International
Airport, has been among the industry's weakest players since Sept.11,
when two of its jetliners were used in the terrorist attacks that
sent the airline industry into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   The ATSB was formed as part of the federal bailout of the airlines
after Sept. 11. The carriers first divided $5 billion of cash, and an
additional $10 billion was available for the loan guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   But United has problems that go well beyond the current travel
slump. Even before the attacks, United was hurting because the
recession had badly crimped business traffic--United's biggest source
of revenue. The economy and passenger loads are coming back, but only
slowly. Mix in United's relatively high labor costs, and UAL lost
$2.1 billion (an industry record) on revenue of $16.1 billion in
2001, and it lost an additional $510 million in this year's first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The company, based in Elk Grove Township, Ill., is on track to
lose $1.2 billion for all of this year, according to analysts
surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Although the industry is
expected to fully recover in 2003, analysts don't see United posting
a profit that year either. UAL's stock, which closed up 3 cents at
$12.19 a share Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, has plunged 67%
over the last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, United's bid to lower employees' wages comes
after thousands of its workers just received big raises, which they
demanded before even entertaining any concessions. Three months ago,
for instance, its mechanics received pay hikes of as much as 37%,
after the mechanics had gone without wage gains for seven years. And
last week, its 25,000 flight attendants were awarded $48 million--the
equivalent of a 7.5% raise--by an arbitration panel that periodically
reviews the attendants' compensation as part of the workers'
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Their union, the Assn. of Flight Attendants, has no interest in
discussing concessions, in part because it doesn't believe that
cutting workers' wages will fix United's problems, said union
spokeswoman Bobbie Pilkington.</TE>
<TE>   As for the loan-guarantee deadline, she said: "That's not a
deadline for us."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a loan guarantee's benefits, the airlines have been
reluctant to seek them. One key reason: The airline would be required
to give the ATSB an ownership stake in exchange for the guarantee.
America West Holding Corp.--the only airline to get a guarantee so
far--secured the deal only after giving the government a 33% equity
interest in the airline and obtaining $600 million in concessions
from creditors and suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   America West also promised to hold down future labor costs and
wasn't required to have specific worker concessions when it got its
$380-million federally backed loan. But its pilots and other workers
are paid less than their peers at the major airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Neidl said it's "not clear that they [United] would have to have
labor concessions in place before they would be granted the loan
guarantee."</TE>
<TE>   But US Airways Group, another carrier that's all but sure to seek
a loan guarantee to avoid a bankruptcy reorganization, is saying it
needs nearly $1billion in worker concessions in preparation of its
ATSB application.</TE>
<TE>   Further muddling the issue is the status of UAL's interim chief
executive, Jack Creighton, a UAL director who was named CEO last year
after James Goodwin resigned under pressure. Creighton expects United
to find a permanent CEO by year's end, and he's vowed to negotiate
the recovery plan with the airline's unions before then. But his
temporary reign raises the question of whether United's unions might
wait to deal with the new CEO's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots' and mechanics' unions, at least, said they're ready to
work out a plan now.</TE>
<TE>   "The deadline [for a loan guarantee] is going to come and go well
before the new CEO gets on the property," said Palazzolo of the Air
Line Pilots Assn.</TE>

<HD>Williams Cos. Energy Trading May Be Probed</HD>
<DH>Power: The company denies an allegation by a former
employee that it manipulated the market to drive up prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TULSA, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Williams Cos., owner of the second-largest network of interstate
natural-gas pipelines, may be investigated on allegations it tried to
corner California's natural-gas market during last year's energy
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Former Williams employee Jones Murphy told the New York Times the
company's director of risk management, Blake Herndon, said to him in
a conversation in December 2000 that Williams' traders were "going to
corner the market and run it up for December closing, which means
delivery in January."</LD>
<LD>   Williams said the article in Sunday's edition of the paper
"erroneously" states its strategy. "The notion would be funny if it
wasn't such a serious thing to say," said Jim Gipson, a Williams
spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is investigating possible
manipulation of California's energy markets in 2000 and 2001. FERC
has asked energy traders, including Williams, if they engaged in
questionable practices detailed in memos it acquired from energy
trader Enron Corp., which has filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   It also questioned companies about "wash trades," in which energy
is bought and sold at the same price to increase trading volumes and
revenues. Williams has denied it engaged in this practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the governor will ask FERC to investigate this as well as
part of its investigation of manipulation of the California power
market," Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said of the
claims in the newspaper report.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one more piece of evidence that FERC needs to refund the
$8.9 billion we're owed," Maviglio said. California wants FERC to
order the refund because it says it was overcharged during the power
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy told Bloomberg News he stands behind his comments in the
article. He said he was fired by Williams after he refused to accept
a demotion.</TE>
<TE>   "If they didn't drive the price of gas up, it would show up in
their trading records," Murphy said. "It would be very easy for them
to show they didn't make huge profits by showing those records."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said last week that it plans to sell as much as $1.5
billion in stock in the next year and $3 billion in assets to raise
cash and reduce debt.</TE>
<TE>   The company, whose stock has fallen 64% in the last year, wants to
convince investors it won't collapse like Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams rose 20 cents to $14.20
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Sharper Eye on Foster Kids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County officials recently agreed to make monthly visits
to the 50,000 formerly neglected and abused children in its care,
mostly in foster homes. Cheers for this victory are muted because it
took two years of court battles, as well as the disappearance of a
5-year-old girl in foster care in Florida whose social worker
apparently reported months of home visits that never occurred. Now,
for visits to be more than perfunctory "drive-bys," L.A.'s
foster-care agency needs to do things differently.</LD>
<LD>   State rules require social workers to stop in on each child in
foster care at least once a month to see whether the child is safe
and well cared for and to plan for adoption or a return to family. In
Los Angeles, however, the huge caseloads, constant staff turnover and
thin budgets have made compliance a challenge. That's why, years ago,
the county let social workers skip visits if they determined that the
children were doing well in stable homes.</LD>
<LD>   This practice rightly alarmed child welfare advocates, who sued.
Once the county takes children from their homes, social workers' most
important duty is to ensure that they remain safe. Yet with each
social worker monitoring 11 to 60 children, some at opposite ends of
the county, and mountains of paperwork, visits can degenerate into a
superficial "drive-by," in social worker parlance.</LD>
<TE>   What would make it better?</TE>
<TE>   * More social workers. The state contributes to the problem by
permitting impossibly high caseloads, because it would have to help
pay for more caseworkers if the limits are reduced. With smaller
caseloads, however, social workers could hang out with kids long
enough to learn whether they're safe and are getting the extra help
so many need with schoolwork and emotional problems. The issue, in a
debt-crisis year, is money.</TE>
<TE>   * Better training. Working with such fragile and vulnerable
children is emotionally grueling and technically complex. Many
caseworkers aren't well enough prepared. Anita Bock, head of the
county's Department of Children and Family Services, says an internal
training "academy" she intends to launch later this year should help.</TE>
<TE>   * Less paperwork. Social workers complain they spend almost as
much time filling out forms as they do visiting children. The
department must do more to streamline paperwork and shift clerical
tasks to administrative staff.</TE>
<TE>   It's not enough for the county to agree to follow the law. It must
make sure that monthly visits help children deal with the traumas
that have derailed their families and start planning for their
futures.</TE>

<LD>This summer's record-setting movie crop provides arguable evidence
that Americans are favoring familiar images and themes, comic book
heroes and galactic gladiators, as they did in their choice of TV
programs after last fall's tragedies. Now, as additional
entertainment, here's a lighter editorial report on vacation movies
you won't see this summer:</LD>
<LD>   * "Power Wars: Attack of the Energy Traders": Well-dressed Texan
shysters with lots of money but no boots battle well-coiffed
California politicians with lots of money but no scruples for the
power to run appliances before 7 p.m. Computer imaging makes Houston
appear livable. Named Yoda no one in this film is. Rated PG-13 for
Violent Shredding.</LD>
<LD>   * "Spider-Nerds": Wacky accountants get wrong shirts from
cleaners, discover web-slinging cuffs, spend breaks swinging between
office buildings. Midair collisions over downtown leave dozens of
tangled bookkeepers.</LD>
<TE>   * "The Jaded Scorpion Queen": Bored young wife of desert warrior
tires of his constant battle absences, his borrowing her necklaces
and failure to shower regularly. Seeks divorce by asp. Rated HD-17
for Historical Distortions.</TE>
<TE>   * "Faithful": Happily married husband and wife accidentally pick
up each other in dark Valley singles bar, then seek divorce citing
mutual monogamy, irreconcilable similarities.</TE>
<TE>   * "My Big Fat Bulgarian Wedding": Would-be emigres dream of Athens
in a prequel to the other wedding movie, only with more mutton and
grenades.</TE>
<TE>   * "Ring of the Lords": Wife of Arkansas farmer Helmut Lord loses
her wedding band during frontyard turkey stampede. Scimitar-swinging
husband slaughters thousands. In craw of the last bird he does not
find the ring.</TE>
<TE>   * "Men in Orange": Caltrans highway workers, their jobs on Earth
complete, land on Mars to repair long-neglected canals. Encounter
aliens in business suits.</TE>
<TE>   * "Some of All the Fears": Tim Clancy rips off his brother's book.</TE>
<TE>   * "Die Airport Die": Docudrama covers one man's interminable waits
in LAX security lines. Rated R for language, full frontal frisks.</TE>
<TE>   * "Changing Lanes (Quelque Chose Bleu)": Engaged Paris couple
leave respective homes on errands at the same moment. She heads west.
He heads south. Neither comes near the other. No one thinks anything
of it. Frustrations of modern life underscored by obscure English
subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   * "Behind Enemy Liens": Warning of budget defaults if secession
succeeds, big-city mayor campaigns for unity in separatist Valley,
encounters old college sweethearts contemplating their own
metaphorical divorce, fighting over the prenup.</TE>
<TE>   * "Never Dye Again Always": James Bond saga continues as 007
combats evil international botox cartel menacing Southern California
water with powerful powder that causes wrinkles and premature
grayness. Mariah Carey threatens to record soundtrack.</TE>

<HD>NATO's Existential Riddle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has a fine history: It
deterred a Soviet attack on Western Europe for half a century. It has
separated warring armies and maintained the peace. More lately, one
war fought, one war won. Now, NATO is changing so fast that the
question is not what it will do but what it is.</LD>
<LD>   At its inception, NATO had 12 members. Last week there were 19,
plus a new junior partner, Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Though planned for years, the partnership with Russia still turns
NATO upside down. NATO's reason for being was collective security,
and that meant readiness to confront one enemy, the Soviet Union,
using nuclear weapons if necessary.</LD>
<TE>   Now NATO has accepted former communist states such as Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic and is about to admit up to seven more
countries, including former Soviet republics such as Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia. That expansion raises the likelihood of the
alliance becoming more political than military. That could leave
Washington without a partner to rely on in the event of threats to
transatlantic security.</TE>
<TE>   NATO operates by consensus, and the difficulties of getting 19
nations to agree on targets and tactics were apparent during the
organization's only war, in Kosovo in 1999. Getting consensus from
more than two dozen eventual members will be even more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   NATO was quick to respond after Sept. 11, for the first time
invoking Article 5 of its charter, declaring that an attack on one
member is an attack on all. It offered assistance to Washington, but
the Pentagon largely conducted the war in Afghanistan on its own in
the early days. Eventually more than a dozen NATO nations provided
forces.</TE>
<TE>   The early go-it-alone ethic bothered some alliance members. But it
did lead many of them to conclude that if they had spent more on
defense and coordinated more closely with the militaries of other
allied forces, Washington might have looked to them for help more
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   En route to the summit where Russia's partnership with NATO was
formalized, President Bush told the German Bundestag that the
creation of the NATO-Russia Council provided an opportunity to build
"common security against common threats." These days that means
terrorism. In that fight, using more NATO forces earlier in
Afghanistan would have done a better job of disrupting the flight of
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters into Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   NATO also can play a major role in the world peacekeeping
business--if that is clarified as its job. Bush, in Germany, stated
that NATO's core mission was unchanged. Unfortunately, that core role
has not been satisfactorily redefined for a new membership since the
days when NATO tanks stood guard at West Germany's Fulda Gap, waiting
for Soviet troops to mass for an attack.</TE>

<LD>James Pinkerton, in his May 30 commentary, "Apocalyptic Tales Can
Come True," speaks of a West Bank militant who confessed to planning
to add cyanide to suicide belt-bombs, and in the same paragraph he
mentions the theft of 10 tons of sodium cyanide near Mexico City.
Considering that some of those barrels of cyanide had not yet been
recovered [they were reported found Friday], I find it astonishing
that you buried your story about the stolen cyanide on Page 6 while
giving prominent front-page coverage to the renewal of "The
Osbournes" series on MTV.</LD>
<LD>   You are the major daily of the country's second-largest city and
yet you continue to behave as if you're People magazine. Avoiding the
link between cyanide thefts in our own backyard and possible
terrorism is bad enough. But burying this article on Page 6 is simply
irresponsible journalism.</LD>

media-savvy wife, their two (of three) teenagers and their marauding
horde of fluffy lap dogs: What's not to like here? But, hey dudes,
save the entertainment news for your Calendar section. Or is The
Times so concerned about "growing readership" through "strategic
rebranding" that you'll stoop to a tiresome magazine-stand cover
stunt like "Surreality TV Triumphs: 'Osbournes' Is Renewed"?</TE>
<TE>   If so, here's a few freebies to try: 1) "Hair Loss: Early Warning
Signs for Children"; 2) "Wow! Check Out My Granny's Abs!" 3) the "New

<HD>Will More People Visit a 'Revitalized' Yosemite?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Price of Great Beauty" (editorial, May 27), regarding the
Yosemite Falls project, was as forceful as the waters of Yosemite
Creek as they surge over Yosemite Falls. The situation at Yosemite
Falls exemplifies what has been allowed to happen in Yosemite Valley:
too much asphalt, inappropriate development and a degraded landscape.
The falls project will change all that in one vital location. In
addition to removing an asphalt parking lot and crumbling walkway and
restoring heavily trampled land, the project will make the Yosemite
Falls viewing platform accessible to people whose mobility is
impaired. All of those changes should be cheered.</LD>
<LD>   In his designs for the project, the world-renowned landscape
architect Lawrence Halprin has accorded this corner of Yosemite the
utmost respect. It has been over five years since the floodwaters of
the Merced River opened the door to a reinvigorated Yosemite Valley
and a year and a half since the Yosemite Valley Plan was approved.
Certainly, Yosemite's time has come! The falls project will
demonstrate once and for all that the goal of the Yosemite Valley
Plan is to restore Yosemite.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I visited Yosemite recently, and it is so true what you say about
visiting the falls being like "negotiating a busy street in a
blighted city." Families were allowing and even encouraging their
children to climb on boulders along the path, trampling any
wildflowers that may have been trying to emerge, even though there
are signs requesting that people stay on the path. There was a young
mother assisting her son as he urinated in the stream. (I guess it
was too far to go back the 200 yards to the "blockhouse" restrooms.)</TE>
<TE>   If these areas are natural treasures and works of art, perhaps we
need to have guards--as they do in museums such as the Getty or
LACMA--to protect them as a masterpiece of art is protected. The
"revitalized access" to the falls will, I fear, only make it easier
to turn them to blight.</TE>

<HD>4th Amendment Rights for an Explosive Age</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Wrong, as a Matter of Law," Commentary, May 30: Jonathan Turley
argues that the search of the computer of a foreign visitor who had
outstayed his visa would be a violation of the 4th Amendment and an
evil far outweighing the possible prevention of the 9/11 disasters.
The 4th Amendment was written at a time when danger might come from a
terrorist carrying a keg of black powder or a single-shot musket that
took over a minute to reload. It did not contemplate a terrorist
planting a nuclear device in the center of a city of 7 million. With
the powder keg or musket it may be entirely reasonable to wait until
the person commits the crime to institute a search. It wouldn't be
reasonable for a nuclear device or even hijacked airliners.</LD>
<LD>   Turley argues that the same standard should be applied to
protecting a person who may have a small stash of drugs in his
apartment as to a person with terrorist connections who perhaps
carries a vial of smallpox virus. We quite literally cannot live with
such a standard. If anything ever cried out for a double standard it
is the 4th Amendment in a time of botulism. Oversight and control of
the double standard, yes. But the law (and Turley) needs to live in
the same dangerous world as we do.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Brown</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turley writes that FBI agent Coleen Rowley was disturbingly wrong
in holding that "if probable cause existed on Sept. 11, it must have
existed before Sept. 11." Turley countered that "this is simply wrong
as a matter of law. The attacks were obviously material to
establishing probable cause against [Zacarias] Moussaoui."</TE>
<TE>   However, if Turley's claim that the attacks of Sept. 11 did, in
fact, establish probable cause, then probable cause was established
long before by the attack on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and
powerfully reinforced by the attacks on the U.S. embassies in Africa
and the Cole in Yemen. Moussaoui was linked to the perpetrators of
these attacks. Agent Rowley gets an A in constitutional law, and
Turley needs a serious refresher course.</TE>

<TE>   Re "FBI Given Broad Authority to Monitor Public Activities," May
31: I applaud the additional leverage the FBI has won--to conduct
domestic counter-terrorism surveillance at places like mosques--as a
major step backward in American culture. After all, they are only
Muslims whom the FBI intends to spy on.</TE>

<TE>   So now the Republicans no longer want the FBI to investigate
interns, Chinese scientists, legal satellite sales to China,
misplaced files, local land deals or sexual harassment cases thrown
out by lower courts ("FBI to Shift Agents to Terror War," May 29)?
You mean, they want the FBI to protect Americans? What a concept!
Imagine how different things might be today if the FBI's past focus
had been on something other than investigating what's-his-name.</TE>

<LD>The answer is soybeans! The question: How to rid the country of the
waste generated by grain-fed beef cattle ("There's a Bone to Pick
With Meat Eaters," Commentary, May 27) and by dairy cows ("Developers
Are Putting Southland's Last Dairy Farmers Out to Pasture," May 27)
and at the same time relieve the misery of African farmers--misery
generated by the $190-billion agriculture subsidy bill just passed
("U.S. Exports Misery to Africa With Farm Bill," May 27).</LD>
<LD>   While admittedly an acquired taste, milk from soy is nutritious.
Burgers from soy are not only very tasty but moist and of fine
texture. So simple, but is there a will to make it happen?</LD>

<LD>As a male I quibble once with Myrna Oliver's otherwise fitting
tribute to Nancy Drew creator Mildred Benson (obituary, May 30). That
is when she writes, "The Nancy Drew books, as most women who read can
tell you. ... " Part of the strength of the books is that they reach
out to all readers.</LD>
<LD>   I learned how to read with the series and so did many of my school
chums. Attendance at the 1993 Nancy Drew Conference at the University
of Iowa (where I met Benson) was split between men and women, and
since the 1970s, nearly half of the scholarly essays and books that
the series has generated have been written by men.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bill to Ban Indian Mascots Is Blocked," May 29:</LD>
<LD>   The California State Assembly failed to ban the use of racially
offensive mascot names from public schools when it had the chance.
Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) hit the nail on the
head when she said, "For too long, we have tolerated racial
insensitivity."</LD>
<LD>   I believe it's the responsibility of our leaders to do the right
thing despite being accused of "political correctness run amok," as
stated by Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth (R-Murrieta). Bashing
political correctness has to some degree become a new tool for those
of the far right to use in justifying institutional racism. It's the
same logic they use in parts of the Deep South in order to keep the
Confederate flag waving at state capitols.</LD>
<TE>   How sad it is to reduce any human being with such a culturally
significant history to a red-skinned caricature mocking his own race
of people, especially since it was most certainly not Native
Americans who began this practice in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   How disappointed I am that our representatives in the state
Assembly (moderates and conservatives alike) didn't have the moral
courage to do the right thing despite a lack of interest from some
Native American groups. I thought they were more progressive than
that. If my maternal grandfather, former chief of the Wyandotte tribe
in northeast Oklahoma, were still alive, he would be very
disappointed in hearing this but not surprised. He spent his entire
life in quiet dignity with this type of racism as a constant
backdrop--as so many others have done and will continue to do,
apparently into the foreseeable future.</TE>

<LD>Re "Shield the Sick, and Society," editorial, May 28: Congratulations
to The Times for supporting AB 1321. As the former supervising judge
of the Mental Health Department of the Superior Court and as a judge
who heard countless criminal matters involving untreated persons with
severe mental illness, I applaud The Times for its support of AB
1421.</LD>
<LD>   As your editorial noted, various civil liberties proponents and
others have taken an ideological approach that blinds itself to the
reality that persons with untreated, persistent mental illness are
themselves the victims of our current laws: They wander the streets
hungry, homeless and without hope, cycle through our hospitals and
are released with no after-care or plan to meet their human
needs--and wind up in our prisons and jails not because they are
criminals but because there simply is no place for them in our
society.</LD>
<TE>   It is well known that the L.A. County Jail and our prison system
are the largest mental institutions in the world. In our jails and
prisons, other prisoners and even staff victimize those with
persistent, severe mental disorders. When discharged, they are
generally far sicker than when they entered custody. And the cost of
their incarceration is astronomically greater than would be the cost
of community-based, effective treatment. AB 1421 would undoubtedly
provide a humane, cost-effective alternative to our present inhumane
and wasteful system. It behooves all of us as concerned citizens to
support this bill.</TE>

<TE>   I was dismayed to read your editorial in favor of legislation to
empower state-enforced psychiatric drugging. There is no scientific
evidence to establish that psychiatric drugs are "shielding" society.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, today there is a swelling controversy surrounding
the potential for violence and suicide associated with many of the
latest psychiatric drugs. A reluctance to consume such drugs could
hardly be deemed irrational, let alone criminal, and yet, under AB
1421, that is exactly what would happen. For no other "crime" than
refusing to be subjected to these unpredictable, mind-altering
substances, virtually anyone could be incarcerated in a mental ward.</TE>

<HD>On 'Slum Survivor,' No One's a Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLIFFORD BOB</AU>
<BD>Clifford Bob is an assistant professor of political
science at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With another season of "Survivor" now over, the networks have an
opportunity to revolutionize "reality television" next year. Instead
of setting 20 Americans down on a lush tropical island, why not
deposit them on the streets of a Third World city? Rather than having
contestants live as no one really does, why not let them scrape by as
hundreds of millions do in places like Karachi, Lagos, Sao Paulo or a
dozen other mega-cities in the developing world?</LD>
<LD>   Why not "Slum Survivor"?</LD>
<LD>   First, strip the contestants of everything but their clothes. Then
generously endow them with $1, more than what 1billion people survive
on daily. For greater human interest, use child or teenage
contestants: More than 40% of the populations in some poor countries
are under 15, with many orphaned, homeless or alone.</LD>
<TE>   Lights, camera, action! Let our contestants loose on the teeming,
filthy streets where life expectancies are two-thirds of those in
developed countries. Intrepid production crews could chronicle the
kids' days as, with every breath of lead-laden air, their mental
capacity declines. No matter. Given the lack of schools even in
democracies like India, intellect doesn't count for much anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Finding food or, better yet, a job would be our child contestants'
first goal. For jaded television audiences, what could be more
nerve-racking than watching their 12-hour workdays in sordid and
dangerous factories? What could be more exciting than their scaling
of colossal garbage heaps to find decayed food, metal scraps and
other precious leavings from local elites? What could be more
poignant than their selling themselves for a few cents, many times a
night?</TE>
<TE>   A place to sleep would also be a challenge: a squalid train
station, a packed tenement room, a windowless shanty. The choices are
tough, but millions find ways. Our contestants would no doubt go to
bed hungry, as do two-thirds of the world's people, and they might
not wake up with their dignity or possessions intact. But perhaps,
through the din and danger, they would manage a little shut-eye.</TE>
<TE>   In the glare of the Klieg lights, "Survivor" contestants have
never had much privacy. But "Slum Survivor" would add a new
dimension: the need to wait for dark to relieve themselves over a
bridge or in a quiet alley, without benefit of tissue or sanitation.
Of course, a contestant might be lucky enough to find a public
toilet, most likely a reeking hole in a concrete floor. But wait. For
the savvy contestant, that "dry latrine" could also be the ticket to
gainful employment. Tens of thousands of South Asia's 240million
"untouchables" still clean them by "manual scavenging" with broom,
basket and bare hands, earning a pittance--and the abhorrence of
their upper-caste clients.</TE>
<TE>   To be truly realistic, "Slum Survivor" would have to take account
of rich nations' poverty reduction programs. Cut! Even with President
Bush's new $10-billion initiative to help the world's poor and with
the larger amounts pledged by other nations, this "largess" is still
too minuscule to be seen on camera.</TE>
<TE>   Prizes? For losing contestants, whose birth in the developed world
already made them winners in the world's greatest crapshoot, a bright
future and a long life, something hapless slum dwellers can only
dream of. And for the final contestant, some understanding about how
the majority of the world's people actually live their lives.</TE>

<HD>A Hemorrhage in the Hospitals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE GORDON</AU>
<BD>Suzanne Gordon is the author of "From Silence to
Voice: What Nurses Know and Must Communicate to the Public" (Cornell
University Press, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to the contemporary nursing shortage, hospitals insist
that they have no choice but to implement short-term "solutions."
There are, the American Hospital Assn. reports, 126,000 nursing
vacancies nationwide, or 12% of capacity.</LD>
<LD>   That's why, some hospitals argue, they have to offer as much as
$10,000 in signing bonuses, $1,000 to $2,000 payments to nurses who
refer another RN to a hospital and money to pay for moving and even
living expenses, as well as for continuing education.</LD>
<LD>   While the Don Juans of the hospital industry are out seducing a
whole new crop of RNs, however, they are neglecting nurses already on
their payrolls. At Catholic Healthcare West, which owns 38 hospitals
in California, nurses' pay lags so far behind that nurses in the
California Nurses Assn. last week staged a protest.</LD>
<TE>   To staff its units, Catholic Healthcare West, like many other
hospital owners across the country, hires temporary nurses through
local registries. These nurses can earn between $32 and $35 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one nurse who has worked for one of Catholic Healthcare
West's hospitals for 16 years told me that he "maxes out" at $27.82
an hour. This nurse asked: "Can you imagine how many nurses would
come back to work for the system permanently if they made" the same
amount as temporary nurses?</TE>
<TE>   The chain has also sent recruiters as far as South Africa and the
Philippines to troll for new nurses. In Sacramento, nurses who work
for Catholic Healthcare West facilities have been asked to pick up
foreign recruits at the airport, help them navigate the RN licensing
process and lodge them in their homes. When expert nurses are asked
to work with and orient new recruits who earn more than they make
after 15 or 20 years of loyal service, the message is clear: If you
want a raise, change employers, not once but over and over again.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, policies at hospitals throughout the country have created
a whole new temporary work force of RNs who quit their jobs and sign
on with traveling-nurse or temporary-nurse agencies. Sometimes these
nurses return to their old employers--at a higher salary and with
better schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Given the industry's message to veteran nurses, it's no wonder
that many nursing students view the hospital as the first rung on a
career ladder that will take them "up" and away from direct bedside
care.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, I interviewed several hundred fourth-year nursing
students in different university nursing schools across the country.
When I asked them whether they wanted to do hospital nursing after
graduation, about half to three-quarters raised their hands. How
many, I asked, envision working in hospitals or in home care or
clinics in 10 or 15 years? A few--sometimes no--hands went up.</TE>
<TE>   These students believed that hospital nursing would be stifling,
offer no opportunities for advancement and wouldn't pay enough. A
couple of years in a hospital to gain experience would suffice before
they moved on to what they considered challenging, well-paid work as
nurse practitioners, managers, nurse midwives, researchers or nurse
anesthetists.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences of this short-term obsession with recruitment are
potentially staggering. Forced to work with only new grads or
temporary nurses, veteran nurses--who depend on the expertise of
colleagues to take care of sicker and sicker patients--will find
their work difficult to manage and will continue their exodus from
the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Without experienced nurses to teach, orient, mentor and guide
them, nurses new to an institution (or a country) will find it
equally difficult to learn the skills that will move them from novice
to expert. Frustrated at their inability to learn and grow, their
views of hospital nursing will be confirmed and they will leave for
the supposedly greener pastures of primary care, research or
management. This will leave an aging, intensely ill population of
patients in the hands of RNs who lack the kind of expertise only
years on the job can provide.</TE>
<TE>   Patients had better pray that assertive nurses are able to
convince the hospital industry that its frenetic focus on
recruitment--absent an equally serious commitment to nurse
retention--is like trying to give a blood transfusion to someone
whose bleeding hasn't been stopped. No matter how much new blood is
added, the patient will eventually bleed to death.</TE>

<LD>Most adults missed something in the films "Star Wars" and
"Goldfinger" because, according to a new National Science Foundation
study, only 45% know that lasers focus light waves rather than sound
waves. That finding bodes well for more junk science in the
courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   The recent NSF study found that overall scientific literacy in the
United States remained fairly low; only 54% of adults know it takes
the Earth one year to orbit the sun. The study also found that belief
in pseudoscience continued to rise: Even though no scientific
evidence supports astrologers' claims, a full 41% of adults believe
that astrology is somewhat scientific. A stronger finding is good
news for psychic hotlines: 60% believe that some people possess
psychic power or ESP. And only 54% agree that humans developed from
earlier species of animals. Perhaps the rest have found a better way
to explain their own tail bones.</LD>
<LD>   The study suggests that most adults are not fit to serve on a jury
that must decide questions of fact based on scientific or technical
evidence.</LD>
<TE>   The law has long since recognized the educational limits of
jurors. Judges alone decide questions of law. They alone interpret
the text of statutes and contracts because long ago, most jurors
could not read. Judges also decide all questions of fact in nonjury
trials. And they have the power to take "judicial notice" of an
alleged fact and force all parties and jurors to accept the alleged
fact as true.</TE>
<TE>   A unanimous U.S. Supreme Court gave federal judges even more power
in 1996, when it said that juries no longer could interpret the
technical claims in a patent. Now only federal judges can interpret a
patent's claims. But just how technically competent are judges?</TE>
<TE>   A study in the judges' magazine Judicature gives some disturbing
answers. The study interviewed 400 state trial court judges from all
50 states. It found that "many judges may not be fully prepared to
deal with the amount, diversity and complexity of the science
presented in their courtrooms" and that "many judges did not
recognize their lack of understanding."</TE>
<TE>   The study measured how well trial judges understood the four
so-called Daubert factors that the Supreme Court in 1993 said federal
courts should consider in deciding whether to admit scientific
evidence into court. A majority understood the two easiest Daubert
factors: whether the evidence had undergone peer review and whether
it was generally accepted. But only about one judge in 20 understood
the two key Daubert factors of testability and error rate.</TE>
<TE>   A claim or theory is testable if, and only if, it is
falsifiable--some observation could in principle refute or falsify
it. For example, observing more helium than hydrogen in the universe
would falsify the theory that the universe began in a fiery "Big
Bang" because that theory predicts the reverse proportions. Such
testability distinguishes science from nonscience. Yet only 6% of
judges understood the concept of falsifiability. A short-term
solution is for judges to hire their own scientific experts to help
them decide the claims of dueling experts. But experts are expensive,
and trials can last for months or even years. The long-term solution
is more science training in elementary and high schools and in law
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, many judges will continue to let dubious experts
testify before scientifically incompetent jurors who can free
murderers or bring down whole corporations. That breach of care
borders on judicial negligence because ignorance of science is no
excuse.</TE>

<HD>Europe, After 9/11, Stands in a U.S. Shadow</HD>
<DH>The Continent is weakening amid a power shift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN POWER</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Power is a London-based columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The primary American transatlantic relationship has been moved
eastward, away from London, Paris and Berlin to Moscow. Nuclear war
between East and West has been consigned to the history books. And,
as if on cue, the nuclear powers on the Indian subcontinent have
rattled their rockets, ready to unleash an Armageddon that will fall
on Asia, not on Europe as we had been brought up to fear.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, it has become clear that the Bush administration
considers its job all but done in Afghanistan. The bombing has given
the American people their pound of flesh. Reconstruction and the
other idealistic goals of nation-building can be left to Europe.</LD>
<LD>   If the U.S. sees a role for itself in this part of the world any
longer, it is only as an emergency interlocutor to try to talk the
Indians and Pakistanis out of nuclear madness. But if it ends in
nuclear war, the U.S. "has no dog in that one," and the Europeans can
be left with helping bury the millions of dead and clearing up the
political mess.</LD>
<TE>   A decade ago, the Cold War seemed really over. I thought my
children would enter adulthood without the fears that haunted my own
childhood. Democracy was spreading fast. "Human rights" was the new
buzzword. War of a major kind seemed not only unlikely but irrelevant
in a world where the forces of globalization had become so dominant
that no one had to spell out that if we didn't all hang together we'd
hang separately.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, the center of gravity was moving back toward
Western Europe. European civilization had dominated the world for
better or worse for 400 years and was about to do so again. The U.S.,
during and after World War II, had briefly taken command but now was
slipping back to its isolationist role. Europe appeared to be
regaining its old step in setting the political and cultural pace for
the world. There was a sense of creating a civilization that was to
flourish without conquest, cooperate without violent diction or
action and seek only to propagate the rule of law for solving both
society's and the world's disputes.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't Slobodan Milosevic who blew a hole in all that;
Yugoslavia was merely a throwback to an era the rest of Europe had
long matured out of. Likewise it wasn't the sudden bursting of ethnic
disputes and wars all over the place. In fact, by 1993 the number of
ethnic disputes began to fall dramatically, as did the number of
wars.</TE>
<TE>   It was simply that Osama bin Laden made George W. Bush's day.
Without Sept. 11, this most unintelligent, uncharismatic and
nonvisionary of recent American presidents would have faded into
obscurity, along with much of his hard-bitten, imperialistic program.
Russia never would have countenanced giving up the fight on the
renunciation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, and it never would
have stepped forward to embrace the U.S. with the personal warmth
that Vladimir V. Putin has exhibited, overriding the views of many of
his closest advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian elite might well have moved willingly to forge a close
relationship with Western Europe, but now European eastern policy, in
comparison with U.S. single-mindedness, seems in disarray. Worried
about how to honor its promise to bring Eastern European members into
the fold, the European Union has stopped thinking of how to deal with
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the U.S. clearly calls the shots. It makes the big
decisions on who needs a good kick and when. If China is not yet
intimidated by this, it soon will be. Meanwhile, Europe is in danger
of muddling along. Its common currency, functioning and effective, is
doing wonders for the marketplace, but the political and cultural
muscle that should grow out of it remains flabby. If Europe does
become merely a "used-up" civilization, it is a turn of events that
the world will live to profoundly regret.</TE>

<HD>When It Comes to Cities, Smaller Is Better</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY SVORNY</AU>
<BD>Shirley Svorny is a professor of economics at Cal
State Northridge.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debating San Fernando Valley secession recently, a leader of One Los
Angeles, an anti- secession group, said there was no such thing as a
good or bad system, that good or bad people determined how government
functioned. If you buy this view, the failure of the Soviet Union had
nothing to do with the dictatorial nature of its socialistic
system--it failed because the wrong people were running it.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to fathom the view that the failure of local government
in L.A. is a result of our inability to find a few good people to run
it. Of course we know better; systems do matter. For one thing, the
size and structure of government affect resident participation. In
smaller cities, studies suggest that residents are more active and
vote more. Princeton political scientist J. Eric Oliver found that
residents in larger cities were less likely to contact officials or
attend community or organizational meetings. A Public Policy
Institute of California study that looked at voting in cities across
the state found lower voter turnout in larger cities.</LD>
<LD>   This means that residents in smaller cities more closely monitor
government, making it harder for special interests--developers,
public employee unions--to affect public policy. That subtly shifts
the balance of power toward those residents who join the debate.</LD>
<TE>   City size affects how public funds are spent. Because government
officials encounter less scrutiny in large cities, money often is
spent on projects and programs that serve special interests rather
than pressing local needs. Rather than providing street lights in
Pacoima, for example, the L.A. City Council chose to subsidize the
2000 Democratic National Convention.</TE>
<TE>   In very large cities, where funds for community projects or
infrastructure come from a citywide general fund, it can be said that
communities are always spending other people's money. This creates
incentives to waste taxpayers' money. Although there haven't been
many studies, a study of the Minneapolis and St. Paul area, reported
in the academic journal Public Choice in 1983, found that when the
commercial-industrial property tax base was shared broadly across the
seven-county metropolitan area, local government spending increased.</TE>
<TE>   The point is that incentives change as government size and
structure change. Downsizing Los Angeles would encourage resident
participation, increasing the voice of local residents in policy and
spending decisions.</TE>
<TE>   There is a potential secondary effect that could improve city
services. Newly elected Valley politicians could choose to place
control over services (garbage collection, tree trimming, police
protection) and policy (land use and zoning) at the council district
level. Local control would allow spending to more closely match the
priorities of residents in an area. Because accountability is clear,
local control facilitates monitoring of service providers and has the
potential to improve services across the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, government size and structure affect public policy and
service. Put all the members of One Los Angeles on the Los Angeles
City Council and they would be subject to the same influences that
current members face. It is not the people, it is the structure, and
L.A. residents will have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to change that
structure in November.</TE>

<LD>The latest in the ever-expanding series of cross-label hits
compilation albums, "Totally Hits 2002," arrives in stores on
Tuesday, and with it a question: Is there a bottom to the compilation
pit?</LD>
<LD>   The fifth volume of the "Totally Hits" series has 20 tracks, from
Pink's "Get the Party Started" and Tweet's "Oops (Oh My)" to Alanis
Morissette's "Hands Clean" and LeAnn Rimes' "Can't Fight the
Moonlight."</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the similarly designed "Now That's What I Call Music!
9" remains in the national Top 10 after 21/2 months, and the eighth
"Now" is still one of the nation's top 200 sellers after more than
six months.</LD>
<TE>   How well can such collections continue to sell?</TE>
<TE>   "The concept of 'well' gets redefined the further we go into
this," says Musicland retail chain buyer Scott Levin. "The 'Now'
series has done very well in Europe for years, and it has become
successful here, too. This ['Totally Hits'] compilation is trying to
get at that same demographic. Over time, there could be a bottom. But
if the songs on each one are right, it almost doesn't matter what you
call it."</TE>
<TE>   Says Tower Records southwest territory director Bob Feterl: "The
'Now' and 'Totally Hits' series have become pretty strong brands. I
see them as the McDonald's and Burger King of the genre, and they're
going to keep selling."</TE>
<TE>   Compilations, retailers say, give record companies something of a
bargain to offer young music fans increasingly used to downloading
songs for free off the Internet. That's partly the fault of record
companies that have all but stopped releasing individual songs for
purchase as singles. Hits compilation albums, retailers say, only
partly remedy the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have kids walking into a store with $5 or $6 in their
pockets," Levin says, "but we're still not able to give them
something they can afford to buy."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Feterl: "When I was a kid, singles started you on the habit.
It's like McDonald's markets to kids.... We marketed to kids with
singles, and they kept coming in and coming in and bought other
things as they got older. That's the problem now.</TE>

<HD>Tolstoy's 'Ivan Ilyich' Meets the CAA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Times staff writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The independent film "ivansxtc" is described by its creator as
Tolstoy meets the Creative Artists Agency. The movie, which opens
Friday in limited release, stars Danny Huston (son of director John
Huston) as a Hollywood super-agent who destroys himself with drugs
and alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   Co-writer and director Bernard Rose ("Immortal Beloved") said he
adapted the film from Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" and was
inspired by his own former CAA agent, Jay Maloney, the Armani-suited
power broker who struggled with cocaine and hanged himself in
November 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Rose said he had finished filming earlier that same year and was
shocked to hear about Maloney's suicide. "After Michael Ovitz left to
go to Disney, it was generally accepted in the business that Jay
would take over CAA." Then, Rose said: "Suddenly he was gone. I
wasn't a party to what really went on." The film has a simple moral,
Rose said. "The one thing we all have in common is that we die. Even
in Hollywood, where success seems to have all the accouterments
anyone could desire, you're not allowed to breathe a word about
mortality. You get a face lift, go to the gym, eat the right foods,
but no one got out alive yet. The moral of Tolstoy's story is [that]
the one thing we have in common, that makes us human, is our own
mortality, and denial of mortality causes that kind of extreme
behavior."</LD>
<TE>   The movie (pronounced "Ivan's ecstasy") portrays agents as
aggressive dealmakers, sometimes betraying friends and clients;
coddling a gun-toting, homophobic star; avoiding clients by
pretending the cell phone has cut out; never reading scripts; and
consorting with prostitutes. Rose used actual footage of CAA
employees at their weekly meeting in a scene showing the Maloney
character being applauded by colleagues for landing a big client. CAA
executives had been cooperating on his project, Rose said, until they
saw the final cut. Rose claims CAA executives and agents were so
upset that they mounted a whispering campaign that prevented the
movie from finding a distributor for a long time. "We were told again
and again by people, 'Nobody wants to touch this movie because they
think they're going to get in trouble with CAA. They won't have
access to the stars.' Whether threats were made actually or by
implication, the effect is the same. It became impossible for me to
get employment as a writer or director," Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   A CAA spokesman said the allegations were untrue.</TE>
<TE>   The movie was filmed with a digital camera on a shoestring budget
and has played on the film festival circuit. It is being distributed
by Artistic License/Zen Pix Inc.</TE>

<HD>Start Spreading the News Around</HD>
<DH>Television* With ownership of two local stations, News
Corp. moves KCOP's newscast to 11 p.m. to avoid competing with
KTTV's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KCOP-TV news anchor Rick Chambers got mixed up at the end of last
Thursday's newscast.</LD>
<LD>   Chambers was attempting to remind viewers that the UPN station's
newscast would premiere in its half-hour 11 p.m. time slot today. The
move is part of a strategy prompted by the station's owner, News
Corp., which also owns KTTV-TV and decided it didn't want to have
both its stations competing with news at 10 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   However, Chambers, seemingly out of habit, told viewers,
"Remember, starting Monday, we'll be starting at 10 p.m. We'll see
you then." As the camera moved away and the closing music started up,
Chambers' smile quickly vanished as he apparently realized the
mistake, but it was too late to correct.</LD>
<TE>   Chambers' confusion is perhaps understandable, since the switch is
an outgrowth of the complicated phenomena known as duopoly, which is
growing steadily in Los Angeles' local TV market, causing anxiety
among news staffers. Under the duopoly concept, a company can own two
stations in the same city. The KCOP-KTTV duopoly is one of four in
the local TV market.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom recently acquired KCAL-TV, which gives CBS' parent company
control of both that station and KCBS-TV. NBC recently completed its
purchase of Spanish-language network Telemundo, which means the
network now owns KNBC-TV, KWHY-TV and KVEA-TV (though KWHY will have
to be sold because of restrictions limiting ownership to two stations
per city). Spanish-language rival Univision also controls two
stations, flagship KMEX-TV and KFTR-TV.</TE>
<TE>   How KCOP and KTTV will operate and cooperate with each other under
the new arrangement remains uncertain. Management for the two
stations declined to be interviewed last week, saying little more
than that the former KCOP news hour would be filled by reruns of
"Seinfeld" and "Frasier." As of Friday, even KCOP's Web site
contained no information about the time switch for the newscast.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Boylan, general manager of the two stations, issued a
grammatically confounding statement that read, "We are providing more
programming choices by offering some of the best comedies every
producers from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m., and we are providing two different
local newscasts at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. times. The L.A. viewer might
not know what media synergy is, but they will now know they have more
programming choices."</TE>
<TE>   Though executives kept their plans close to the vest, staffers at
the two stations have been told that the separate news operations
will remain independent and that there is no immediate
cross-promotion planned. For example, anchors for the KTTV news are
not expected--at least for now--to advise viewers that they can
switch to KCOP to see more news.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy is being used by KCAL and KCBS, with KCAL recently
airing promos for KCBS' news during a Lakers playoff game. And
anchors at the two stations have been promoting stories on their
sister stations' newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   The duopolies are causing concerns among staffers at the newsrooms
involved. Don Corsini, KCAL general manager who has now also assumed
management of KCBS, reportedly criticized the news operation at KCBS
during a meeting last week, fueling speculation that there will be
additional changes there.</TE>
<TE>   Said a spokesman for KCBS and KCAL: "We're exploring ways for the
stations to work together. We want to cross-promote as effectively as
possible without taking away each station's distinctive identity."</TE>
<TE>   "UPN News 13" might need that kind of promotional boost. The
newscast won a 2001 local Emmy Award for best newscast longer than 35
minutes but has traditionally trailed its 10 p.m. rivals at KCAL,
KTTV and KTLA (which is owned by Tribune Co., owner of the Los
Angeles Times). The newscast, hoping to attract a younger audience,
features youth-oriented stories on fashion and music.</TE>
<TE>   As for changes to the format with the time switch, members of the
KCOP news staff say the 11 p.m. newscast will be faster-paced and
contain more stories than the established newscasts of KCBS, KNBC and
KABC. "We're supposed to be an alternative to them," said one news
staffer.</TE>
<TE>   Industry observers, though, are speculating that the revamped
lineup at KCOP will not have a significant effect on the ratings
race.</TE>
<TE>   "The station's newscast was never that dominant in the first
place," said Nancy McLachlan, senior vice president and broadcast
director of Initiative Media, an ad-buying firm that purchases
commercial time on local television.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting something else in that time slot may not affect ratings
either. And the KCOP news going up against those other newscast will
probably not do that well."</TE>

<DH>Puccini's 'Gianni Schicchi' and Bartok's 'Duke Bluebeard's
Castle' close the L.A. Opera season by sharing the stage, the star
and the staircase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Opera closes its 2001-02 season with a rarity of a double
bill: two acknowledged masterpieces from the 20th century, Bela
Bartok's "Duke Bluebeard's Castle" and Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi."</LD>
<LD>   Bartok's single opera and Puccini's single comedy, both first
produced in 1918, are different stage animals but are complementary.
The former is mysterious, allusive, symbolic and ambiguous; the
latter, accessible, beautifully crafted and easy to love. Each
represents a high point for its composer.</LD>
<LD>   At the Friday night opening in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the
accomplished and multi-gifted Samuel Ramey sang both title roles. The
American bass-baritone's versatility could not surprise longtime
admirers, yet his myriad vocal and dramatic resources, remarkably
demonstrated as the enigmatic, many-faceted Bluebeard and as the
genius-scoundrel Schicchi, had to thrill even the observer who knew
in advance the scope of these challenges. Ramey is a national
treasure.</LD>
<TE>   The new productions, designed by Gottfried Pilz, with lighting
designs by Paul Pyant, mesh with the effective staging by film
director William Friedkin ("The Exorcist," "The French Connection"),
who has European operatic credits.</TE>
<TE>   The "Bluebeard" realization can be controversial. Two examples: In
place of crowning Judith, Bluebeard at the end of the piece strangles
her, a piece of business not in the libretto. The three immortal
wives appear only as ghostly flying things--swooshing linens instead
of real women. Therefore, at the end, Judith, instead of taking her
place among the other wives, merely remains on the floor, dead and
hardly immortal.</TE>
<TE>   "Gianni Schicchi" seems to have been updated to post-Mussolini
Florence; Buoso Donati's house is high-ceilinged and palatial in a
1950s style; his family's general affluence is reflected in rich,
fashionable clothing of the time, which the singing actors wear
handsomely.</TE>
<TE>   With admirable wit, the designer carries over from the opera about
curiosity to the opera about greed a few props, plus a huge and
stunning circular staircase, which dominates the action.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Nagano, the company's principal conductor, led both works.
His "Schicchi" is sometimes pushed and not always savored, but it
retains many of its numerous musical charms.</TE>
<TE>   His "Bluebeard" is loose and often unspecific about
tempo-relations; as a result, what should be a taut, accumulative
musical experience becomes haphazard. The work is a great one and,
incidentally, the largest orchestral canvas the composer ever
created. The Friday performance merely approximated that greatness
without delivering its substance.</TE>
<TE>   As Judith, Bluebeard's curious fourth wife, Denyce Graves is
seriously overmatched. Not only does her mellow voice lack all the
expressive hues the score calls for, she also chose to omit the high
C at the center and climax of the work.</TE>
<TE>   More than other 20th century composers, Bartok valued symmetry
above all: This work begins and ends in the enigmatic nether regions
of F-sharp, but at its center--where the Fifth Door is opened--it
peaks on pure, pristine C major. The vocal outburst on high C at that
moment--complemented by one of the loudest orchestral climaxes in the
literature--cannot be changed without damage to the entire structure.</TE>
<TE>   The cast of "Gianni Schicchi" supports Ramey's definitive title
character with strength and humor. Veteran mezzo-soprano Rosalind
Elias is at the center of this resourceful ensemble, which also
includes Roberto Iarussi, Jessica Rivera, Stefano de Peppo, the
delightful Tony R. Dillon (as Simone), Vitalij Kowaljow and Suzanna
Guzman.</TE>
<TE>   The lovers are Danielle De Niese and Rolando Villazon. Given the
lack of resonating surfaces on this huge stage, all the voices sound
small. That hardly matters; the ensemble's the thing. Also
contributing are James Creswell, Pablo Porras, Robert Hovencamp and
Reid Bruton.</TE>
<TE>   In both works, the orchestra plays well and reliably. Only the
crucial buildup to the Fifth Door in "Bluebeard" lacked its wonted
substance; it came too soon because it had not been properly
prepared.</TE>

<HD>Pizzi, Huffsteter Romp Through Inventive Set</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York is the destination of choice for most jazz musicians, the
compact, high-intensity arena in which to test one's skills and
compete with the finest.</LD>
<LD>   But Southern California--despite its more relaxed ambience and
expansive geography--is filled with world-class players. Although
their visibility suffers from the need to make a living by recording
and playing in film orchestras, their improvisational skills remain
first rate.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday at an attractive new jazz room, Fitzgerald's in Woodland
Hills, multi-woodwind instrumentalist Ray Pizzi and
trumpeter/flugelhornist Steve Huffsteter romped through a set of
material that was inventively engaging, rhythmically upbeat and
brimming with musical wit and whimsy. Both appeared as featured
artists with the venue's resident ensemble--pianist John Hammond's
trio.</LD>
<TE>   Although attendance was light for the opening sets (the Lakers and
the Kings were battling through the sixth game of their epic playoff
series), the music--energized by the ebullient, wise-cracking Pizzi--
was first rate.</TE>
<TE>   Blending the experience of veterans with a still-youthful
enthusiasm for improvisation, the players moved easily from one
spontaneously selected tune after another. Most were
standards--"Alone Together," "Nancy With the Laughing Face," "It
Could Happen to You," "Stella by Starlight" among them--the sort of
tunes that accomplished jazz artists probably can play in their
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   But in Pizzi's hands, in particular, the music came to life.</TE>
<TE>   Constantly in search of an imaginative approach, he frequently
turned to the other players, signaling on-the-spot shifts of
emphasis. On "Alone Together," for example, he dug into a
passionately rhythmic soprano saxophone and drums exchange; on "Sweet
Lorraine" he romped through the familiar line on his own, sketching
out the chords, whipping through fiery upper register runs; and on
Clare Fischer's lovely "Pensativa," he joined his soprano saxophone
with Huffsteter's fluegelhorn in a lovely, floating, samba-tinged
melodic statement.</TE>
<TE>   Pizzi's interaction with Huffsteter, in fact, was another of the
evening's pleasant aspects, with Huffsteter's cool-toned lines
providing an ideal contrast to Pizzi's heated expressiveness. The
confident, briskly swinging, harmonically lush accompaniment and
sturdy rhythmic support of the Hammond trio provided the final pieces
in a well-crafted set of impressive Southland jazz.</TE>

<HD>The White Stripes Stand Out in the Middle of a Crossroads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The White Stripes' Jack White loves being mysterious about his
personal history, even introducing his drummer Meg White as his big
sister, though many Stripes fans believe she's really his ex-wife.</LD>
<LD>   So White would probably be delighted if someone started spreading
the word that he was with Robert Johnson at the mythical crossroads
when the legendary blues singer made a pact with the devil to gain
superhuman musical powers.</LD>
<LD>   Those who saw the Stripes' spectacular weekend performances at the
El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles and the Glass House in Pomona might
even think there's something to that scenario.</LD>
<TE>   How else do you explain someone whose fearless independence and
explosive artistry place him in a great rock tradition that stretches
from Kurt Cobain and Trent Reznor all the way back to Johnny Cash and
the rest of the Sun Records stable?</TE>
<TE>   There isn't a more thrilling new figure in American rock, and he's
a big reason why rock seems to be turning a corner after a drab late
'90s.</TE>
<TE>   Just days after the Hives, the engaging punk-garage band from
Sweden, reminded a Roxy crowd of the joy of simple fun in rock, the
Stripes reminded fans Friday at the El Rey and Saturday at the Glass
House of just about everything else that can make a band absorbing.</TE>
<TE>   The Stripes' music is smart, liberating, witty, teasing and
wonderfully sensual, and the two musicians sometimes show a
Zeppelin-like explosiveness, complete with Robert Plant-like howl.</TE>
<TE>   And there's certainly no absence of fun. During "The Union
Forever," a song built around lines from "Citizen Kane," White donned
a derby Saturday and duplicated a few cocky dance steps from the
Orson Welles film.</TE>
<TE>   White's music is rooted in the blues, and he could be a winning
performer if he devoted Stripes concerts just to his urgent,
impassioned treatments of old blues tunes, including Johnson's "Stop
Breaking Down," which the Detroit duo included on its self-titled
1999 debut album on the independent label Sympathy for the Record
Industry.</TE>
<TE>   As a singer and a guitarist, White rarely moves in a straight
line. He'll make sharp turns or abrupt stops and starts, each one
punctuated by violent twists of his body. It's as if he's always on
the lookout for a more powerful or convincing way of getting to the
heart of the song's emotional core.</TE>
<TE>   The Stripes are also effective dipping into country music, as on a
remake of Loretta Lynn's "Rated X" (sung both nights by Meg White)
and in Friday's version of Dolly Parton's "Jolene."</TE>
<TE>   In the latter, a woman pleads with the prettier Jolene to leave
her man alone. Without changing the character's gender, White adds a
darker, Roy Orbison-like sense of desperation and doubt vocally to
Parton's lines: "Jolene, Jolene ... I'm begging of you, please don't
take my man/Jolene, Jolene, please don't take him, just because you
can."</TE>
<TE>   But White's artistry rests in his own material, which ranges from
the urgent blues-rock of "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground" and "Fell
in Love With a Girl" to the vital, rockabilly, Gram Parsons-inspired
"Hotel Yorba" to the sweet, tuneful, innocent, Paul Westerberg-like
"We're Going to Be Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Because the attention is mostly on her partner, Meg White seems to
be simply decoration early in the show, but she proves a remarkably
appealing and versatile drummer whose steady, insistent hand serves
as an anchor for Jack's sweeping emotional excursions.</TE>
<TE>   After three indie albums, including last year's superb "White
Blood Cells," the Stripes have been picked up by V2 Records and are
at work on their major-label debut. At a time when rock 'n' roll
itself seems at a crossroads, this band is at the right time and in
the right place to make a major difference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles. 8 p.m. Sold out. (323) 936-4790.</TE>

<HD>'Mahagonny' Tribute Features Songs, Talk From Patti Smith</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a 1977 interview, New York art maverick Harry Smith said that the
best response to his final experimental film "Mahagonny," then a work
in progress, was "if the audience goes to sleep." So you have to
wonder what Smith, who died in 1991 at age 68, would have made of the
events last week at the Getty Center's Harold M. Williams Auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   A restored version of the film was shown Thursday for the first
time since 1980, followed Friday by an all-day symposium aimed at
unraveling the knotty and highly idiosyncratic work.</LD>
<LD>   And capping it off was a charmingly ramshackle performance by
Patti Smith, one of his most famous friends and proteges, who appears
briefly in the film.</LD>
<TE>   Accompanied by her son, Jackson, on acoustic guitar, the art-punk
icon topped off a few readings and songs of her own with personalized
versions of three songs by composer Kurt Weill, who with Bertolt
Brecht wrote the savagely satirical 1930 opera "Rise and Fall of the
City of Mahagonny," the inspiration (and score) for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The film is a complexly woven series of images arranged in four
quadrants of the screen, somehow impressionistically linking '70s
Manhattan to the lawless, doomed city of the Weill/Brecht opera. (The
complete recording of the famed 1956 version starring Lotte Lenya
serves as the soundtrack--all two hours and 22 minutes of it, in
German). And its structure, Smith said, was derived from a
mathematical analysis of Marcel Duchamp's conceptual art piece "Large
Glass."</TE>
<TE>   For the first part of the film, such images as New York street
scenes, women doing stylized tai chi-type movements or making cat's
cradles with string loops, and patterns made in colored sand are
flopped in mirror images meeting in the middle. Later, each quarter
of the screen holds independent shots. It's part kaleidoscope, part
Rorschach, part cabalistic ritual, created with obsessive attention
to detail over a 10-year period by a truly eccentric artist.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's screening, some audience members did fall asleep.
Others grew fidgety, and some simply gave up and left before it was
done.</TE>
<TE>   Even at Friday's symposium, experts as diverse as Stanford
University music department chair Stephen Hinton, Duchamp authority
David Joselit of UC Irvine and critic Gary Indiana seemed confounded
in trying to find any direct parallels between the film and,
respectively, the original opera, "Large Glass" and the social
conditions of Weill's Weimar Republic and Smith's Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   In her symposium talk, Patti Smith presented loving, touching and
humorous remembrances of the filmmaker and the Chelsea Hotel, the
Manhattan artists' haven where they both lived.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw Harry's film last night, it just seemed to me like
Harry--innocent," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith echoed that sentiment in the evening with her song "Boy
Cried Wolf," which features the line "innocence had its day." And
there was an innocent quality to her tentative yet dramatic
recitation of "Pirate Jenny" from the Brecht/Weill "The Threepenny
Opera," and a fully sung version of "Alabama Song," which, she joked,
is the hit single of "Mahagonny."</TE>
<TE>   And her overall reaction to the film?</TE>
<TE>   "It made me cry," she said in the symposium, sheepishly adding,
"when I'd wake up."</TE>

<HD>Real Threat of 'Clones' Is Its Campy Perspective</HD>

<LD>Although many critics have cruelly attempted to destroy it, "Star
Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" is actually a breathtaking
cinematic achievement. By synthesizing epic archetypal themes with
gut-churning special effects and the gay theatrical tradition of high
camp, George Lucas has created a potent and disturbing commentary on
our own bloated and blind American society.</LD>
<LD>   Just as Oscar Wilde skewered the hypocrisies of the Victorian
bourgeoisie while providing them with irresistible entertainment, so
Lucas has used his formidable imagination to show us that the
supposed pillars of American culture have fallen into shambles, while
a growing, unconscious group-mindedness, systematic wastefulness and
destructive militarism are rising toward a terrible, inevitable
crescendo.</LD>
<TE>   It is no accident that Lucas and his most obvious gay character,
Jar Jar Binks, have been so pummeled in the press, in ways that could
be seen to parallel Wilde's public humiliation upon the discovery of
his homosexuality. For many in modern America, the truly subversive
and frightening import of a very campy "Attack of the Clones" is
deeply threatening, provoking intensely defensive reactions, which
can be seen, for example, in Kenneth Turan's withering review of the
film ("When We Last Saw Our Heroes ...," May 13) and columnist
Patrick Goldstein's recent slam against Lucas ("Seclusion Has Left
Lucas Out of Touch," May 21).</TE>
<TE>   Much of what these two writers say must literally be reversed in
order to achieve a more accurate appreciation of "Attack of the
Clones"--and is more appropriately used in its original form to
describe the writers themselves. Thus, Turan's claim that the new
film "doesn't have much of a heart" indicates his own coldness toward
its deeper meaning. And Goldstein's statement that the film has "no
soul or spirit" sounds like it could be more truthfully a projection
of some unexamined emptiness and alienation in him. Surely it does
not describe the awesome experience of watching "Attack of the
Clones" for those who more fully appreciate the film.</TE>
<TE>   What Turan, Goldstein and many others have failed to understand is
that the style of dialogue and acting in "Attack of the Clones" is
intentionally campy, a subversive mode of performance that gay people
have used for centuries to express their outsider perspective on the
dominant culture.</TE>
<TE>   Exemplified by Wilde in his own colorful personality and such
plays as "The Importance of Being Earnest," camp has been described
by writer Joshua Glenn as "engaged irony." It is a unique and
incisive way to expose problematic human behaviors while
simultaneously having empathy for the subjects of the critique. Now
it has achieved a new kind of meaningful prominence in "Attack of the
Clones." Although camp is often humorous, it can also be unsettling,
even dark, and always has something serious to say at heart. In
"Attack of the Clones," Lucas uses camp in subtle ways to comment on
the attitudes and actions of his characters.</TE>
<TE>   The young lovers Padme and Anakin may be courting one another on
the far-off planet of Naboo, but it is our own culture's cliched
honeymoon images of Venice and Niagara Falls that Lucas is visually
quoting here to bracket the romance and to tip off moviegoers that he
is being campy. When Padme tells Anakin that "I truly, deeply love
you," they are immediately greeted by an arena full of jeering
sentient insects, another Lucas tip-off to viewers about his true
intent: ridiculing their irresponsible descent into unconscious
union.</TE>
<TE>   The lovers' dialogue is purposely lifted from soap operas and
Harlequin romances to highlight the stultifying cultural effect of
this attitude toward romance. Here Lucas is exposing the destructive
machinery of an American culture that coerces human beings to blindly
imitate and conform to smarmy, shadowless images of heterosexual
romance, with terribly destructive and soul-killing results. Our
heroine Padme finds herself soothing and eventually marrying a
budding mass murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, in modern America so many people get married and have
children without realizing that they barely know themselves or their
spouses, with insidious consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas does not limit his critique to unconscious heterosexual
romance, but also uses subtle styles of camp to highlight the
imperfections of our most beloved Jedi knights in their role as
leaders. Even the spry new digital Yoda, who knows something is
terribly wrong in the galaxy, cannot see that he is being played like
an old puppet by his supposed ally, Chancellor Palpatine. Likewise,
we modern Americans allow our "elected" chief executive to claim
"sole superpower" status against a so-called "axis of evil" and
witness now another corporate-military-industrial buildup that rivals
even the imagined one portrayed in "Attack of the Clones."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Americans consume and pollute at a rate far
beyond the planet's ultimate capacity while paying only lip service
to protecting the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lucas could not have known the specifics of recent world
events in the early stages of filming, his understanding of our
crippled social system runs deep. The prescient parallels between the
film and our own current situation are downright chilling.</TE>
<TE>   Our society as a whole unfortunately shares the same attitude as
the arrogant librarian in the Jedi temple who says, "If an item does
not appear in our records, it does not exist."</TE>
<TE>   So many of us imagine ourselves as only "good," failing to
recognize and come to terms with the "dark side" in ourselves, our
loved ones, our leaders and our entire society.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than "bring balance to the Force" within us, our current
system is intensifying how the darkness that remains unconscious gets
projected onto despised "others" such as gay people, minorities,
foreign cultures and the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas has offered us a deeply felt warning about the price of such
massive denial, but one that may be too late to reverse the
inexorable descent of a decaying, overripe social order that is
leading to planetary devastation.</TE>

<HD>Mostly 'Modern Millie'</HD>
<DH>The lighthearted production takes six Tonys, including best
musical, to lead the pack. 'Urinetown' and 'Private Lives' capture
three apiece at the 56th annual ceremonies.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Culminating a year in which Broadway worried about its survival, the
theater community awarded its top honors Sunday night to a musical
based on a film, "Thoroughly Modern Millie," and to Edward Albee's
first new Broadway play in 19 years.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to a year ago, when the Tony Awards were a coronation
of "The Producers," the honors were spread around this time. While
"Millie" led the way by taking home six--half the number of "The
Producers"--the provocatively named "Urinetown, the Musical" won
three of the most prized Tonys for a musical, for best book, score
and director.</LD>
<LD>   Noel Coward's classic comedy about a bickering couple, "Private
Lives," also won three Tonys, one for best revival of a play.</LD>
<TE>   Three veteran actors won second Tonys more than two decades after
their first. But all four of the acting awards for women went to
first-time winners.</TE>
<TE>   Cantankerous Broadway favorite Elaine Stritch broke down in tears
after her autobiographical one-woman show won her a first Tony at 77.
The tears were not of happiness but frustration, however, when the
curtain came down on her acceptance speech.</TE>
<TE>   The revival of one of the most legendary of musicals, "Oklahoma!,"
took home but a single award. The ABBA musical, "Mamma Mia!," was
shut out, despite earning five nominations.</TE>
<TE>   "Into the Woods," which premiered at Los Angeles' Ahmanson
Theatre, won for best revival of a musical, besting the highly
anticipated London import "Oklahoma!" "Into the Woods'" Brian
MacDevitt also took honors for lighting design.</TE>
<TE>   But the evening's biggest winner was "Millie," which opened on
Broadway in April to mixed reviews, with the sometimes-host of
another awards show, the Academy Awards, as one of its producers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a cynical show. It's a piece of fluff," said Whoopi
Goldberg, who first planned to redo the 1967 film starring Julie
Andrews and Mary Tyler Moore. "But it's a piece of fluff we're very
proud of."</TE>
<TE>   "Millie," about a gold-digging flapper in 1920s Manhattan, "a
canary ready to fly free," came into the evening with 11 nominations,
more than any other musical or play. The show had its premiere at the
La Jolla Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg said she once considered taking a role in the musical
herself, but "now forget it--I'm not goin' anywhere near it," she
quipped.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being named best new musical, "Millie" won for best
choreography, orchestrations, costume design and two performing
honors: best featured actress in a musical, Harriet Harris, and for
best leading actress in a musical, Sutton Foster, who plays "Millie,"
both first-time Tony winners. The 27-year-old Foster's award was the
culmination of a classic Broadway tale itself. An understudy in La
Jolla, she was elevated to the starring role at the last moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Millie" won the first two awards announced, including the
choreography honor, which went to Rob Ashford in an upset of sorts,
besting five-time winner Susan Stroman, who worked up the dance
routines for the revival of "Oklahoma!"</TE>
<TE>   But "Urinetown" then took the next two awards thanks to Greg
Kotis, who won best book honors for the first musical he wrote, and
minutes later collected a second Tony for best original score,
sharing that honor with Mark Hollmann, who wrote the music.</TE>
<TE>   Kotis later called the honors "a badge of credibility" that he
hoped might prompt more theatergoers to risk seeing a show with such
a risky title and story--about a rebellion against a pay-toilet
monopoly in a time of drought. The show, which spoofs other musicals,
premiered at the 1999 New York Fringe Festival and had bad luck in
scheduling its transfer to Broadway--a preview that would have drawn
many reviewers was scheduled for Sept. 11. Though that performance
was canceled, the show was the first new production to open on
Broadway after the attacks on the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Broadway was a wonderful beneficiary of the goodwill of the
country," Kotis said. "We were in peril and the city came together."</TE>
<TE>   Of the evening's Tony wins, he said, "It means that it's a show
that's safe to see. It's getting them in the door that's been hard."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged once considering titling the show with a
cleaned-up pun on "Urinetown," namely, "You're In Town."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its less-than-stellar ticket sales on Broadway, there
already are plans for a national tour that will include Los Angeles,
and productions in Tokyo and London.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just so fortunate that we're on Broadway," said the
director, John Rando, who won the show's third Tony of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "Urinetown" was not the only winning show seemingly unlikely to
even be showing in the nation's most prominent theater district.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based director Mary Zimmerman first staged the current
version of "Metamorphoses" with students at Northwestern University.
The play later was staged at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles
before heading to New York, and even then, "there aren't any famous
actors in my play," noted Zimmerman, who won for best direction of a
play.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the actors taking home second Tonys after long gaps
was Frank Langella, who won back in 1975 for his performance in
Albee's "Seascape." He won this time as best featured actor in a
play, for his portrayal of a Russian "infamous fatuous fop," as he
described the character, in Mike Poulton's adaptation of Ivan
Turgenev's "Fortune's Fool."</TE>
<TE>   "The trick is to stay at the table ... and wait for a winning
hand," Langella said.</TE>
<TE>   John Lithgow, better known for his dramatic roles and his ongoing
comedy turn on television, then took home the prize as best leading
actor in a musical for his scheming gossip columnist J.J. Hunsecker
in "The Sweet Smell of Success," though he said the other nominees
"all sing better than I do."</TE>
<TE>   Lithgow won his previous Tony 29 years ago, for "The Changing
Room." This was his 17th Broadway show but his first in 14 years, as
his career turned to film and television. "My next role should be
Dolly.... 'It's so nice to be back where I belong,'" said Lithgow.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that his last musical role was in 1970 summer stock, and
that he'd never done a Broadway musical before, Lithgow said, "It's
nice to reach my age and have a first time experience at anything."</TE>
<TE>   Waiting almost as long for a second Tony was Alan Bates, who won
in 1973 for "Butley" and this time as best leading actor in a play
for portraying an impoverished Russian aristocrat, alongside
Langella, in "Fortune's Fool."</TE>
<TE>   Though a revival of an Albee play has won a Tony since, his last
for a new work came in 1962, for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
This year, he was honored for "The Goat or Who Is Sylvia?" about a
man who falls in love with a goat. It beat out, among other plays,
"Topdog/Underdog," Suzan-Lori Parks' comic drama about warring
brothers, which recently won the Pulitzer Prize.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted people to think about the unimaginable happening to
them," Albee said. One of Sunday's most popular winners was Stritch
for special theatrical event, the one-woman show, "Elaine Stritch at
Liberty." She surprised no one by talking on even when the familiar
your-time-is-up music began and the TV show switched to a commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the veteran actress did not take this curtain in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very, very upset about the whole situation," she told
reporters. "I know that CBS can't let people do the Gettysburg
Address up there, but ... it's pretty emotional for a woman my age to
win her first Tony, [and] to be cut down like that has spoiled it for
me."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's ceremony, telecast for the first hour on PBS and then the
last two hours on CBS, included a musical tribute to New York, but
few overt references to the crisis that threatened Broadway since
last year's Tonys.</TE>
<TE>   Though most all cultural institutions suffered after Sept. 11 as
tourists became wary of taking airplanes, and even New York
suburbanites gave second thought to visiting Manhattan, the impact
was particularly severe on high-cost Broadway shows, which were in
danger of losing millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Producers appealed to theatrical unions for wage concession, the
city bought up 50,000 tickets for $50 each and a $1-million
advertising campaign featured leading performers crooning "New York,
New York" around the world.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, even amid warnings from national political leaders
of ongoing terrorists threats to such public landmarks, Times Square
is crammed with visitors once again. The theater producers even wound
up returning $1 million of the $2.5-million city subsidy, and
restored union concessions granted while theaters were nearly empty
in September.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we really dodged a bullet," said Jed Bernstein, president
of the League of American Theaters and Producers.</TE>
<TE>   In the June-to-June theater season just ended, overall grosses
were down just 3.5% from 2001, and attendance down just 8%.</TE>
<TE>   "It also encouraging that there were 38 new productions as opposed
to 27 [last year]. No one knew if they would be able to raise money
for new shows."</TE>

<HD>'Laramie Project' Powerfully Conveys Hope</HD>
<DH>The play, which examines a town's reaction to a brutal
killing, makes a riveting L.A. premiere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are moments that define America's character, drawing complex,
contradictory impulses to the surface for the world to see.</LD>
<LD>   The ongoing example, of course, is Sept. 11. A different one
occurred in Laramie, Wyo., in October 1998, when Matthew Shepard, a
21-year-old college student, was severely beaten, tied to a fence and
left to die. The brutality caught people short, as did the fact that
it was committed by two men no older than Shepard, spurred to their
actions in part because he was gay.</LD>
<LD>   Soon after news teams swarmed the city of 27,000, Moises Kaufman
and nine members of his New York City-based Tectonic Theater Project
(the creators of "Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde")
also traveled there to talk to residents. From more than 200
interviews, the company shaped the documentary theater piece "The
Laramie Project," a galvanic work that tickles out disturbing
American traits even as it discovers enormous reserves of openness
and compassion.</LD>
<TE>   Though given its premiere more than two years ago in Denver, the
play is just now receiving its first Los Angeles production.</TE>
<TE>   A riveting presentation by the Colony Theatre Company had
Saturday's opening-night audience listening in absolute, attentive
silence, except for outbursts of surprised laughter and scattered
coughs as people choked back tears.</TE>
<TE>   In Tectonic's production (which traveled to Berkeley and La Jolla
last year), company members portrayed themselves at work in Laramie
and were able to re-create their interview subjects from firsthand
knowledge. Director Nick DeGruccio and his Colony cast have no such
connection and had to find the truth in the text itself.</TE>
<TE>   The action unfolds against the expansive blue backdrop of the
Wyoming sky, with the slatted wood floor of Bradley Kaye's set design
rising into foothills. The eight performers portray nearly 80 people,
providing a running narrative as they don recognizable costume
elements--a police jacket, for example, or a cowboy hat--and adjust
their voices and mannerisms to shift from one character to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Their words, transcribed verbatim from the interviews, repeatedly
stress that Laramie is a live-and-let-live sort of place. Yet every
once in a while, a voice emerges to insinuate that by living openly,
Shepard invited what happened to him.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most compelling interviewees are a policewoman called to
the crime scene (Nancy Learmonth), whose professional composure keeps
cracking with emotion, and her plain-spoken, open-hearted mom (Jodi
Carlisle). A bartender (Tony Maggio) who saw Shepard leave with his
attackers proves to be a natural raconteur, while a lesbian friend of
Shepard's (Faith Coley Salie) and a political-minded Islamic feminist
(Alison Shanks) provide some of the deepest, most heartfelt insights.</TE>
<TE>   Shepard's father (Chip Heller) gives a moving in-court eulogy to
his son, while in the community, a Catholic priest and a police
investigator (both played by Ed F. Martin) are among those who open
themselves to the incident's harsh lessons and work to achieve
change.</TE>
<TE>   But the character who best exemplifies Laramie's growth is a
talkative University of Wyoming theater student (Chad Borden) who
pours everything he's learned into his portrayal of the gay character
Prior Walter in a school production of "Angels in America" and is
deeply mortified over an earlier, not entirely accepting attitude
toward gay people.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with "The Laramie Project," the Colony is taking the
economically challenging step up to union-sanctioned mid-size theater
production in its new 276-seat home.</TE>
<TE>   This powerful production proves that the company is up to the
task, the play's messages mixing with the Colony's own dreams as
sunlight bursts through rain clouds (a gorgeous effect of Steven
Young's lighting) and a character says: "The whole thing, you see,
the whole thing ropes around hope. H-O-P-E."</TE>

<HD>Jubilee Hits a Royal High Note</HD>
<DH>The scene* A crowd of 12,000 Britons picnics on the palace
lawn for a classical concert, the first of two musical evenings
feting Queen Elizabeth II.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Once, at a Beatles royal performance, John Lennon suggested that the
rich and mighty who wished to applaud from the expensive seats could
just "rattle your jewelry." On a lingeringly warm Saturday evening,
in the first of two huge public concerts in the gardens of Buckingham
Palace marking Queen Elizabeth II's 50 years on the throne, there
wasn't a lot of jewelry to rattle--just murmuring strings of pearls
around titled necks.</LD>
<LD>   And there weren't too many of the rich and mighty, either: only
12,000 run-of-the-mill Britons who had won the lottery of a lifetime,
an invitation to the classical concert, the first of two musical
evenings of the queen's Golden Jubilee.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's concert will be headlined by rock 'n' roll aristocrats
and survivors such as Eric Clapton, Elton John, Beach Boy Brian
Wilson and Paul McCartney--making it a classical concert in its own
way, given that when the Beatles first topped the charts, the queen
had been on the throne only a dozen years. (It wasn't long after that
that Lennon and McCartney wrote the sprightly lyric, "Her Majesty's a
pretty nice girl, but she doesn't have a lot to say," and it wasn't
long after that that the Sex Pistols sang "God Save the Queen/She
Ain't No Human Being," released in 1977, coinciding with the queen's
Silver Jubilee.)</LD>
<TE>   A recent "richest Britons" list ranked McCartney, along with
Andrew Lloyd Webber, as a lot richer than their sovereign lady, the
queen. British pop music has become an economic staple in the queen's
reign, and news of slipping sales overseas prompted a newspaper
report last week about an emergency government meeting to try to stop
the slide. Imagine an American president contemplating such measures.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's classics are more to the queen's tastes than tonight's
Atomic Kitten, Roger Daltrey and the sight of Queen's Brian May
playing "God Save the Queen" on the roof of Buckingham Palace.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the attractions of Buckingham Palace, the Saturday
lineup could have filled any concert hall in the world: cellist
Mstislav Rostropovich, simulcast playing Villa-Lobos in the palace's
Music Room, which was aglow with light; opera's hot couple, tenor
Roberto Alagna and soprano Angela Gheorghiu, in a duet from "La
Traviata" with champagne flutes in hand; and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa,
crossing two centuries and two continents with "Carmen" and "Porgy
and Bess" selections.</TE>
<TE>   While tonight's pops concert is considered the hot ticket--never
mind the headliners, princes William and Harry will be there--but
there was something in Saturday's concert to put sparkle in the
gossips' champagne. No one said so publicly, but the last time most
Britons heard Te Kanawa sing, it was at Prince Charles' wedding to
Diana Spencer, who died in 1997 after a ghastly public breakup.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Charles' longtime lady love, Camilla Parker Bowles,
was invited by the queen into the royal box--a first that royal
watchers were chewing over all weekend. As many people were craning
in their seats to have a look at the pink-clad Camilla as at the
queen.</TE>
<TE>   If this was Camilla's first official post-Diana invitation to the
royal box, it was the first palace invitation, period, for thousands
of Britons, the first time so many had swarmed the garden without
being on some list of the good and worthy. People got their tickets
by submitting names to a lottery, and winners were tempted less than
one might have thought by scalpers, who were reported offering as
much as 2,500 pounds (or about $3,640) for a pair of tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Guests filed goggle-eyed through even the drearier parts of
Buckingham Palace, a maze of royal offices with an office-block
feel--the Pentagon, with marble busts. They picked up nylon picnic
kits filled with dinners of salmon and chicken, or pasta for
vegetarians, with a gold-stamped rain poncho and a half-bottle of
pretty fair champagne.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone strolling the grounds in the extraordinarily fine June
weather could hear people chattering away on cell phones--"Guess
where I am? Buckingham Palace!"--especially as they waited under the
horse chestnut trees in long lines for bathrooms. Some of the 2
million ticket-seekers, like Sharon and Dale King of Hull, would have
preferred to be among the 12,000 at tonight's pops concert. But as
Sharon King sensibly admitted, "That's what the queen wanted, wasn't
it, for people to have different experiences?"</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't even know the words to the national anthem, ['God Save
the Queen']," she admitted.</TE>
<TE>   "You  don't, I do," her husband twitted her. She is 27 and he is
39, a dinner-lady at a school cafeteria and a street cleaner for the
local government, and they've heard no end of jokes about "the Kings
going to see the queen."</TE>
<TE>   Like a summer evening at the Hollywood Bowl, people spread their
picnics on the grass, the largest mowed lawn in Britain. Like the
Bowl, the quality of food didn't matter so much as the ambience, and
in Bowl mode, there were flashy fireworks for Handel's "Royal
Fireworks" music.</TE>
<TE>   Pyrotechnics would wrap up a Bowl performance, but it was "God
Save the Queen" that rounded out Saturday night, with everyone but
the queen singing lustily, and peeking at their neighbors to see who
needed to read the lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   For tonight's concert, performers have been admonished not to
scream or swear, expose untoward amounts of skin or act
outrageous--are you listening, Ozzy Osbourne? The other big unknown
is whether the queen, who joins her son and heir onstage for the
finale singing of the Lennon-McCartney song "All You Need Is Love,"
will warble along. If she does, she may be among the few who have to
read the lyrics, too.</TE>

<HD>'The Sum of All Fears' Opens to the Sum of $31.2 Million</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After drawing media attention on the entertainment and editorial
pages of newspapers and on television for its nuclear terrorist plot
line, "The Sum of All Fears" overtook "Star Wars: Episode II Attack
of the Clones" as the top film in the country over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The Tom Clancy adaptation starring Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman
earned an estimated $31.2 million in 3,183 theaters, appealing mainly
to older males and females--two-thirds of the audience was older than
25, according to a Paramount Pictures spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   Affleck's younger version of Clancy's hero Jack Ryan compares
favorably with the previous Ryan outing, "Clear and Present Danger,"
which starred Harrison Ford and opened in August 1994 to $20.3
million.</LD>
<TE>   Paramount carefully balanced its marketing, playing up the film's
action without avoiding the fact that it deals with the explosion of
a nuclear device that has been smuggled into the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount senior executive Rob Friedman says the studio did some
fine tuning in the marketing as opening day approached, but that the
long screening program (the film was finished before the Sept. 11
attacks on New York and the Pentagon) elicited so much positive
response that his job was providing balance "to demonstrate that we
weren't trying to capitalize on current events and not promoting a
different movie from the one they were going to see in theaters."</TE>
<TE>   Present-day world tensions actually made the film "more
compelling" to screening audiences, says producer Mace Neufeld,
though he regrets that critics "reviewed how audiences would react to
the movie rather than the movie itself."</TE>
<TE>   By opening "Sum" right after the Memorial Day holiday, Paramount
got a jump on a number of movies aimed at the adult male action
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend brings another nuclear terrorism tale, the more comic
"Bad Company," starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock, which was
delayed from a Christmas release in response to Sept. 11. "The Bourne
Identity" and "Windtalkers" arrive the following weekend and Steven
Spielberg's sci-fi "Minority Report" on June 21.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance was down considerably from the record Memorial Day
holiday, making it one of the few weekends of the year to compare
unfavorably with the comparable period in 2001. Given that many of
the top movies in release cater to a male audience, the two Lakers'
championship games (on Friday and Sunday) did not help matters.</TE>
<TE>   The only other film that premiered was Imagine Entertainment's
'70s blaxploitation spoof "Undercover Brother," which drew amused
critical response and a healthy $12.1 million in 2,167 theaters,
putting it in fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   "Attack of the Clones" nose-dived 57% to an estimated $20.7
million and a three-week total of about $232 million. "Star Wars:
Episode I The Phantom Menace" also lost steam early in its run but
hung on through the summer to gross more than $430 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" has been hanging on tenaciously in midweek,
attracting young patrons who are already out of school. The fifth
weekend was holding at about $14.5 million and continuing to break
records--it reached the $350 million plateau in only 31 days
("Phantom Menace" took nine days longer). By midweek, "Spider-Man"
should climb into the top-five-grossing movies of all time, bumping
off "Jurassic Park," which grossed $357 million.</TE>
<TE>   Holding well in its second weekend is the animated "Spirit:
Stallion of the Cimarron," which dropped less than any movie in the
Top 10 from the holiday (about 40%) to an estimated $10.7 million.
Its total after 10 days is $38.2 million.</TE>

<HD>Andrew W.K. Keeps the Focus on Fun With 'Party' Songs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Headbanging pop-rocker Andrew W.K. pushed streamers of long,
sweat-drenched brown hair from his face and grinned devilishly at his
House of Blues audience on Friday. "There's nothing wrong with having
fun," he bellowed, as his quintet launched into another song fusing
the dopiest elements of metal, punk and new wave.</LD>
<LD>   The statement pretty much summed up the possibly
tongue-in-cheek--possibly not--philosophy of this Michigan-raised
singer-songwriter, 22, whose debut album, "I Get Wet," has garnered
attention in mainstream publications as well as the music press.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, so long as your definition of fun included such
anti-pretentious tunes as "Party Til You Puke," "It's Time to Party"
and "Party Hard," the 50-minute set was a bracing blast of dumb
pleasure anthems (interspersed with such lunkheaded sensitivity as
the shy-guy lament "She Is Beautiful").</LD>
<TE>   With their lowest-common-denominator abandon and melodic (but
mostly recorded) keyboard riffs, the songs evoked a super-aggro Cars
or a modern Twisted Sister. Yet they were also rendered nearly
indistinguishable from one another by the combination of three
blustering guitars turned up to 11 and the lack of keyboard
spontaneity.</TE>
<TE>   Whiffs of rebellion made it possible to view A.W.K. as a populist
subversive, but more likely the defiant bits simply plugged into the
formula for "what've-you-got?" rock 'n' roll insouciance. At their
deepest, these tunes gleefully advocated diving into life, which was
a noble enough effort on behalf of rock's eternal spirit. But if this
is 21st century idiot genius, then please pass the Slade.</TE>

<HD>Master Chorale Attempts a Tough Handel Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Handel's "Israel in Egypt" presents problems that not even the Los
Angeles Master Chorale at its most glorious, as it was Saturday at
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, could wholly solve.</LD>
<LD>   Annette Landgraf's reconstruction of the missing Part 1 ("The
Lamentations of the Israelites for the Death of Joseph") in 1999 for
the ongoing Halle Handel Edition has challenged all subsequent
performances. We can no longer consider this a work in two parts, as
it was presented here. We've gotten used to such performances, which
start so abruptly and which may throw off the proper balance between
grief and triumph, but we at least need to acknowledge the issue. The
program notes didn't.</LD>
<LD>   More intrinsic problems include the dominance of choruses over
solos and duets and the text, taken from Exodus, which heaps
destruction upon the innocent as well as the guilty. In the notes,
music director Grant Gershon acknowledged his discomfort with this
particular issue but argued the work's compensatory compassion for
humanity as well as simply facing its contradictions.</LD>
<TE>   Still, what do you do with "The Lord is a man of war"? Here, solo
basses Jinyoung Jang and Lewis Landau struck deliberately
self-satisfied poses before, incidentally, singing the duet
spiritedly. But Handel's music isn't fatuous, and the same sentiment
rings throughout the text. You can't disavow it with these kinds of
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   At full 111-voice throttle, the chorale made a rich, stupendous
sound. "He gave them hailstones" was sung with crackerjack
virtuosity, and "The Lord shall reign" and "Sing ye to the Lord" were
among the choruses that gave visceral thrills. But the
pedal-to-the-metal approach proved wearying too. Gershon's dynamic
options with a chorale of the size proved limited, as were efforts at
text painting.</TE>
<TE>   Except in the scaled-down accompaniment for the soloists, the
orchestra's richly varied contributions could often be missed.</TE>
<TE>   Of the other soloists, countertenor Steven Rickards sang with
sweet agility, Jonathan Mack with a forthright if pale tenor and
Tania Batson with a somewhat small soprano. Holly Shaw Price
confidently joined Batson in the soprano duet "The Lord is my
strength."</TE>

<HD>Despite Fine Cast, 'Smash' Isn't a Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The tepid, largely unamusing and wholly unprovocative production of
"Smash," which opened Saturday at the Old Globe Theatre, has been
adapted from one of the lesser novels of George Bernard Shaw.</LD>
<LD>   The overriding question is not how, but why.</LD>
<LD>   When there is far better Shaw for the asking--plays where the
ideas and satire still snap and the male-female sparks still fly--why
reach back for "An Unsocial Socialist," a tract the great grouch
wrote for a socialist magazine long before he mastered his form or
content?</LD>
<TE>   As adapted by the Globe's playwright-in-residence Jeffrey Hatcher,
"Smash" has the usual Shavian hobbyhorses: capitalism versus
socialism, do-gooders versus men of action, the working class versus
the leisure class.</TE>
<TE>   In his great works, Shaw's ideas and outsized characters have
survived the test of time and changing political sensibilities. Does
anyone doubt that industrialist Andrew Undershaft from "Major
Barbara" would fit perfectly at Enron?</TE>
<TE>   In "Smash"--the title comes from a line about the need to "smash"
the old civilization--the half-formed ideas are now musty and the
characters smallish.</TE>
<TE>   "The poor don't want bread and gruel, they want power," says
millionaire-socialist Sidney Trefusis (played by Charles Borland) as
he dumps his gorgeous bride at the altar to go foment revolution at a
girls' boarding school.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally the road to uprising does not go straight, and there are
class- and gender-based complications.</TE>
<TE>   Harnessed to a weak and obvious script, the cast does its best,
particularly the supporting players.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran stage-screen actor Paul Benedict is the school's aging
custodian Lumpkin who punctures the upper classes from behind a
booze-soaked beard. Priscilla Allen brings gravitas to the ironfisted
Miss Wilson, the headmistress.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Kary is suitably silly as the lovesick pedant Chichester
Erskine, and Eric Martin Brown is fine as the foppish Sir Charles
Brandon.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Ryland as the moneyed Mr. Jansenius delivers some of the best

<HD>A Dramatic Shifting in 'Shape'</HD>
<DH>Neil LaBute's story of a college couple's turbulent romance
takes a sharp turn toward the end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shape of Neil LaBute's "The Shape of Things" changes dramatically
about a half-hour before the play ends.</LD>
<LD>   Until then, it has been a story of an increasingly turbulent
romance between two students at a small-town college. Evelyn's a grad
student in art; Adam's a junior who's majoring in English.</LD>
<LD>   Twists transpire, aided by another, engaged couple. The second
young man, Philip, used to room with Adam.</LD>
<TE>   As the story moves along, in Richard Stein's alert staging at
Laguna Playhouse, the absence of an intermission is noticeable. A
couple of points in the narrative seem like logical moments for the
action to take a brief break.</TE>
<TE>   But LaBute apparently doesn't want to run the risk that
theatergoers might leave before they experience the transformation of
the play near the end. Otherwise they would miss his main point,
which isn't at all about contemporary college romances. It's about
the purposes of art and media and the ethics of those who create
them.</TE>
<TE>   The play acquires a dimension that goes far beyond its initial
setting. LaBute's observations extend to the seemingly disparate
worlds of unscripted television programs for the masses and
avant-garde performance art for the few.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who wants to experience the full impact of the play's
surprises should probably stop reading now. We won't explicitly give
away the crucial turn of events, but more details might make it
easier to figure out.</TE>
<TE>   Evelyn and Adam meet at an art gallery, where Adam works as a
guard. His shift is almost over; he'll leave soon for his other job
at a video store. But then he notices that Evelyn has stepped beyond
the rope that is supposed to deter visitors from approaching a
particular sculpture. Worse, she holds a can of spray paint.</TE>
<TE>   We quickly learn that Evelyn is a brash risk-taker and that Adam
is hesitant to take control of a situation. This is the pattern that
dominates their budding relationship. Evelyn insults Adam's friends
and makes pointed suggestions about how he might improve his health
and his looks. Intrigued by her interest in him, Adam willingly takes
the hints and follows her advice.</TE>
<TE>   No, this isn't another LaBute script--like those for his movies
"In the Company of Men" and "Your Friends and Neighbors" and program
of one-acts "Bash"--in which the man is the bad guy. Although traces
of LaBute's previous male manipulators show up in the secondary
character of Philip, Adam himself is disarmingly guileless and
malleable.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Michael Eric Strickland's Adam is stupid. He puts a quick
spin on his more clever retorts. He throws literary allusions at
Evelyn that she doesn't catch; she responds with references to TV
characters that he doesn't get. Strickland evinces a certain charm.</TE>
<TE>   But Adam is also too willing to say that's something's "amazing."
In retrospect, it's amazing that he didn't ask a few more questions
of Evelyn that might have led him to the truth about their
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Solodkin softens Evelyn's ruthlessness with a beguiling
smile and even an occasional girlish giggle. Jay Boyer and Robyn
Cohen provide sharp support.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Richard Odle's primary set consists of a large mobile that
dangles garishly over the stage, which can be seen as representing
the position into which Adam is thrust. Other set pieces come and go,
with the transitions accompanied by blasts of rock and punk.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shape of Things" may not be wholly plausible on a realistic
level, but it's a captivating parable about contemporary culture.</TE>

<HD>Curling Up With Anime 'Hamtaro'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The anime invasion of American television continues today with
"Hamtaro: Little Hamster, Big Adventures," which will play twice each
weekday on the Cartoon Network (7 a.m. and 4 p.m.). It's an
English-language adaptation of "Tottoko Hamtaro" (Hamtaro the
Hamster), a TV series aimed at small children that aired in Japan two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   With his outsized round head, huge eyes, big ears and tiny limbs,
Hamtaro is another relentlessly cheerful, hyper-cute character in the
tradition of "Hello Kitty" and Pikachu. Hamtaro's owner, Ritsuko, was
only 5 years old in the original series. She's been renamed Laura and
is clearly supposed to be older here, but her skinny limbs and large
head suggest a young child's proportions.</LD>
<LD>   In the opening episode, "Hamtaro, Please Come Home," Laura and her
parents move to a new house in a scenic suburb. While they're
unpacking, Hamtaro sneaks out to explore and starts making friends.
He meets a nervous, apologetic Hamster named Oxnard from a nearby
house, and Boss, a "field hamster" who lives in a tunnel. Together,
they serenade Bijou, a girl hamster Boss admires.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard, Boss and Bijou are clearly just the first of what will be
Hamtaro's many friends (the opening titles show dozens of hamsters).
And Laura meets one of her new classmates at a local stationary store
when they both reach for a writing tablet with a hamster on it. The
neighborhood is apparently overrun with the little rodents.</TE>
<TE>   "Hamtaro" is a harmless enough entertainment for pre-schoolers,
but their older siblings will dismiss it as saccharine and sappy.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his wool skull cap, scraggly beard and black T-shirt bedecked
with glitter graffiti, English singer-songwriter Damon Gough, a.k.a.
Badly Drawn Boy, could have been mistaken for any number of hipster
patrons at Amoeba Music in Hollywood on Friday. But, in fact, he was
the poser being watched, as part of the record store's terrific free
concert series.</LD>
<LD>   The acclaimed singer, whose current album is the charming
soundtrack to the film "About a Boy," was beguiling, if a little
unrehearsed. His hour-plus set began inauspiciously. For the opening
number, Gough held up a portable DVD player that piped music as he
sang along. The moment had its cheeky charm but, mercifully, that
cheek didn't bleed over into the rest of the set.</LD>
<LD>   Gough, in fact, is a sharp-witted songwriter with an unerring ear
for the dissonance between word and deed in romantic relationships.
His fragile, whimsical material is rife with wordplay and lush,
byzantine arrangements, but for this set, Gough had only his acoustic
guitar, an electric keyboard and an accompanying guitarist to fill in
all of those big spaces.</LD>
<TE>   It worked more often than not. Gough's tremulous, boyish voice was
endearing enough to compensate for the deficiencies in his shaky, and
frequently wayward, guitar parts. A little spit and polish wouldn't
have hurt, however.</TE>

<HD>Congress' Brief Legislative Fever Has Broken</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lots of show but little substantive lawmaking
seems likely again as elections near, in contrast to post-attack days
of action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Almost nine months after Congress defied its reputation for dithering
with a quick response to the Sept. 11 attacks, stalemate is
back--with a vengeance.</LD>
<LD>   Major bills affecting energy policy, trade agreements, managed
health care, bankruptcy law and anti-terrorism insurance have stalled
short of the legislative finish line, with no certainty that a
polarized Congress can break the logjams as the November elections
near.</LD>
<LD>   As lawmakers return this week from a weeklong recess, the result
may be a season of legislative Kabuki theater: a performance that is
long on political gestures and short on producing major laws in a
Congress narrowly divided between the two parties.</LD>
<TE>   So, for example, Democrats who run the Senate plan action on a
bill to crack down on hate crimes, even though the measure is
expected to die in the Republican-controlled House. For their part,
House GOP leaders plan to push for more tax cuts, despite bleak
prospects the plan will gain approval from the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   And while leaders of both parties say they want to create a
prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, few on Capitol
Hill think they will bridge differences on key details and produce a
law this year.</TE>
<TE>   It's a far cry from the post-Sept. 11 days of whirlwind
legislating, when with uncharacteristic dispatch lawmakers passed
major bills to fund military operations in Afghanistan, giving the
government new tools to combat terrorism and tighten airport
security. That experience with a resolute Congress may mean voters
are less tolerant of the gridlock expected to hamper the rest of this
session.</TE>
<TE>   "The cat is out of the bag. People saw after Sept. 11 that
Congress could, working with the president, get things done," said
David Winston, a GOP pollster. "People now know that the only reason
things won't happen is that partisan interests are taking a higher
priority over the people's interest."</TE>
<TE>   There is still plenty of time to finish major bills before
Congress adjourns, probably in October; lawmakers often wait until
the end of a session to strike their deals. But the key question is
whether they have the political will to compromise on health, energy
and other pending issues--or whether they want to take their
differences to the voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these [disputes] are a combination of ... deeply held
views and politics, which reinforce each other to push both sides
away from an agreement," said Barbara Sinclair, a professor of
political science at UCLA. "I wouldn't expect this to be a session in
which we talk about a lot of landmark legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans blame Democrats who control the Senate, especially
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, for the backlog.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, in a memo to fellow
Republicans, said Daschle "epitomizes the phrase 'do-nothing
Democrat.'"</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle is unrepentant. "Some people want to call our refusal
to rubber stamp the Republican agenda obstructionism," he said in a
recent speech. "I see it as rejecting failed ideas in the name of
real solutions. And I call that progress."</TE>
<TE>   On one front, Congress has no choice but to act: It has to approve
13 annual appropriation bills to keep the government running after
the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   A core issue in that debate will be funding the war on terrorism
and domestic security measures. Indeed, the first issue facing the
Senate when it returns today is a bill to provide emergency
appropriations for the military operation in Afghanistan and
increased homeland security. That measure poses the first test of
President Bush's ability to keep congressional spending within limits
in this budget cycle: He has requested $27 billion, the House
approved $29 billion and the Senate version would increase the total
to $31 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has warned the Senate against producing a budget-busting
bill. "The [emergency bill] shouldn't be viewed as an opportunity to
load up ... with special projects," Bush said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also will have to act quickly on increasing the legal
limit on federal borrowing, which the Treasury Department says must
be approved by June 28. Some House Republicans don't want to be on
record supporting an increase of the national debt. So GOP leaders
are trying to slip the measure into another bill, which would avoid a
direct vote on the debt limit hike. Daschle, however, may try to
block that maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   Still, everyone agrees the debt limit needs to be raised because
inaction would cause an unprecedented default on payments to holders
of government bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of other issues is more uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Bush has urged Congress to renew and strengthen the
landmark 1996 welfare reform law. The House has approved such a
measure, but it is unclear whether the Senate will act quickly enough
for a final compromise to be struck. Senate Democrats remain divided
over proposals to make work requirements more strict for welfare
recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Both the House and Senate have passed energy bills, but they
require a conference committee to resolve their vast differences. The
House bill stresses increasing domestic energy production and
includes Bush's controversial proposal to increase oil drilling in
Alaska. The Senate version emphasizes conservation measures; an
effort to include the Alaska proposal was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the lawmakers may balk at having any bill at all.</TE>
<TE>   Such an outcome would be "a flinch on both sides," said Will
Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist
Democratic think tank. "No one wants to make the kinds of strenuous
changes needed to promote energy independence."</TE>
<TE>   A major bill to expand presidential power to negotiate trade
agreements also has passed the House and Senate; but again, major
differences remain. The Senate included provisions that may thwart a
compromise with House Republicans. One would provide new aid to
workers who lose their jobs because of international trade; another
would give Congress power to alter parts of trade pacts.</TE>
<TE>   On another front, lawmakers are close to agreement on a major
overhaul of the bankruptcy code. But negotiations have stalled on a
single emotional issue: a provision to crack down on antiabortion
activists who file for bankruptcy to dodge fines levied for violent
protests clinics. The dispute threatens to sink the entire measure.</TE>
<TE>   Bills addressing other issues face even :</TE>
<TE>   Tax cuts: House Republicans want to speed up implementation of the
sweeping 10-year tax cut enacted last year. Democrats have resisted,
but the Senate is slated to vote this month on the most popular
element of the GOP tax agenda: a push to make permanent repeal of the
estate tax.</TE>
<TE>   Health: Both parties support in principle a prescription drug
benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. Many House Republicans made it a
central theme of town hall meetings they conducted in their districts
during last week's recess. But Republicans have insisted on linking a
new drug benefit to broader reform of the Medicare program--a subject
about which there is little consensus between the parties.</TE>
<TE>   The principal sticking point involves how much to expand a
patient's right to sue an HMO. Senate Democrats and Bush
administration officials have conducted informal negotiations to
break the impasse, but months of talks have come to naught.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning: Daschle has promised action on legislation, already
passed by the House, to ban human cloning. The Senate will face a
choice between two competing approaches. One, backed by Bush and the
House, would ban all human cloning. A narrower bill would ban only
reproductive cloning. The outcome of this debate is in doubt, and it
is not certain whether either approach would have enough support to
clear the Senate.</TE>

<DL>BERKELEY TOWNSHIP, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A forest fire burned across more than 500 acres near a state park on
Sunday, threatening about 100 homes and shutting down 20 miles of the
Garden State Parkway.</LD>
<LD>   One house was engulfed in flames and nine were damaged. State
police said the parkway was closed along the east side of Double
Trouble State Park, and several local roads also were shut down.</LD>
<LD>   Berkeley Township Police evacuated the town's Pinewald section,
sending residents to a school building. By early evening, fire
officials said the main threat was that the flames were burning
toward nearby Beachwood.</LD>
<TE>   "We were working in the backyard and we saw all this smoke out
there," said Geri Morris, wife of Beachwood Mayor Harold Morris. "My
niece called from the back of Beachwood and said, 'Everything's
turning black.'"</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters' efforts were hindered by 30 mph wind gusts and
drought conditions. They initially tried to contain the flames but
had to fall back, said Horace Somes, division fire warden for the New
Jersey Forest Fire Service.</TE>
<TE>   "May was an average rainfall month, but on top of that we had 12
months of dryness," he said. "We have a fire on our hands we can't
fight with normal attack."</TE>
<TE>   About 60 state firefighters and 100 volunteers battled the blaze,
using at least three helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was in central New Jersey near the coast about 50 miles
northeast of Atlantic City. The parkway in the area is usually packed
on summer weekends.</TE>

<HD>Program Benefits Kids With Most to Lose, Survey Finds</HD>
<DH>Education: Parents in Early Head Start learn how to
discipline, keep their children safe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Toddlers enrolled in a federal program that coaches parents in
learning techniques are less likely to need discipline and more
likely to read than children not participating in Early Head Start, a
government study found.</LD>
<LD>   The program, geared for low-income parents and their children from
birth to age 3, helped families get along better and improved
toddlers' scores on standardized tests, according to the study issued
today. Early Head Start was found to have had the greatest effect on
the poorest families.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very impressive finding when you say, 'The ones we had the
biggest impact with were those that face the most challenges,'" said
author Wade Horn, the assistant secretary for children and families
at the Health and Human Services Department.</LD>
<TE>   Parents in Early Head Start are taught how to keep their children
safe and to discipline them gently, Horn said. Adults are reminded to
get youngsters inoculated and are encouraged to read frequently to
their infants from age 6 months on.</TE>
<TE>   Parents also get coached about helping their children learn, for
example, by walking down the street with them and counting the number
of trees along the street, Horn said.</TE>
<TE>   The positive effects of Early Head Start increased over time, Horn
said, in contrast with most other child-intervention programs.</TE>
<TE>   Head Start was expanded to include Early Head Start in 1995, when
many poor parents were employed or at school because of welfare
reform and a strong economy.</TE>
<TE>   Some Early Head Start programs are combined with day care at
community centers, some involve visits to the family's home and some
combine both.</TE>
<TE>   About 55,000 children are enrolled in the program in 664
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The study showed that the program helped lift parents' depression
and increased school attendance among teenage parents.</TE>
<TE>   The study of 3,001 families in 17 programs also found that:</TE>
<TE>   Early Head Start children ages 2 and 3 sustained higher average
scores on standardized tests measuring cognitive and language
development than a control group of children not in the program.</TE>
<TE>   Early Head Start parents were slightly more likely to read to
their children than those not in the program. They also were gentler,
with 46.7% saying they had spanked their children in the last week,
compared with 53.8% of the control group parents.</TE>
<TE>   The study makes some recommendations, including that center-based
programs offer more parenting services and that home-based programs
offer more visits and more services.</TE>

<HD>'Turning Off' Genes, and HIV</HD>
<DH>Science: Tests find that forms of RNA can halt proteins
needed by virus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A form of ribonucleic acid developed by researchers at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology silences genes that play a role
in HIV infection, potentially showing a new way to combat the virus
that causes AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   The team used short forms of RNA that "turn off" genes vital for
the production of proteins used by the virus to enter and infect
cells. RNA carries the blueprint for constructing proteins.</LD>
<LD>   "If many obstacles can be surmounted, this could be a basis for
intervention in HIV treatment," said Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, who led
the research.</LD>
<TE>   The work was conducted in the laboratory, and problems to be
solved include finding ways to deliver the RNA to cells in animals or
humans, to ensure it would not interfere with normal biological
processes and would not have side effects, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The work, reported Sunday in the online edition of the journal
Nature Medicine, is a "proof of concept," Sharp said. He won the 1993
Nobel Prize for the discovery of "split genes," which changed how
scientists look at evolution and advanced research into hereditary
diseases, including some cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Louis M. Mansky of Ohio State University, who was not part of
the research team, said the findings were interesting, but added that
"there are a lot of concerns as to how it would be applicable."</TE>
<TE>   Mansky said there have been difficulties in getting similar
strategies to work in clinical settings.</TE>
<TE>   In lab tests, the RNA reduced, but did not eliminate, the virus,
and thus Mansky said it might be useful in addition to the current
drugs used to combat AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "I don't think this, by itself, would be superior
to the drug 'cocktails' now used for treating HIV individuals."</TE>
<TE>   RNA is present in most cells, carrying genetic information and
operating in protein production.</TE>
<TE>   The team currently is working with mouse genes, Sharp said.</TE>

<LD>A former Honduran economic minister who was kidnapped two weeks ago
was found dead, police said, even though his family reportedly paid
$125,000 in ransom.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Reginaldo Panting, 71, was discovered along an
isolated street in San Pedro Sula, the largest city in northern
Honduras. Harry Panting identified the body of his father, who had a
nylon rope tied around his neck and his hands bound behind his back.</LD>
<LD>   The body was near the area where police said a friend of the
family, a priest, had turned over the $125,000 ransom.</LD>
<TE>   Panting, who left his economy post in 1997, was kidnapped May 18
as he was driving to his house outside San Pedro Sula.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Seventy-two percent of Swiss voters endorsed legislation making it
easier for a woman to get an abortion within the first 12 weeks of
pregnancy. Swiss lawmakers last year passed the measure,
decriminalizing some abortions by easing the legal requirements on
women and their doctors.</LD>
<LD>   The new law takes effect Oct. 1. Switzerland's current abortion
law is one of the strictest in Europe, yet it is rarely enforced.</LD>
<LD>   The new law still requires women to present a written request for
an abortion, prove they face "distress" if they have a child and meet
with their doctor in the presence of a counselor.</LD>
<TE>   After 12 weeks, a woman can have an abortion if the doctor
believes that her "physical integrity" will be threatened.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A power struggle in Canada's governing Liberal Party brought the
second Cabinet shuffle in a week, with Prime Minister Jean Chretien
ousting Finance Minister Paul Martin, the man considered the
front-runner to succeed him.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter announcing the move, Chretien praised Martin for
outstanding service but said nongovernment issues made it impossible
for them to work together.</LD>
<LD>   An overt campaign by Martin's supporters to position him as
Chretien's successor had angered the prime minister. He has blamed
the undeclared battle to succeed him for recent leaks that
contributed to allegations of influence peddling and cronyism by
members of his Cabinet. Defense Minister Art Eggleton was forced to
resign May 26 for giving a government contract to a former
girlfriend.</LD>

<HD>Hindus Build Pressure for Temple</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AYODHYA, India</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Hindu nationalists prayed and marched Sunday at the
epicenter of India's most bitter religious dispute, winding up a
108-day celebration that was part of a campaign to pressure the
government to let them build a temple at the site of a razed mosque.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 10,000 police and paramilitary troops guarded the northern
town of Ayodhya, where authorities feared Hindu-Muslim clashes or an
attack by Islamic guerrillas.</LD>
<LD>   Devotees prayed at the site, where in 1992 thousands of Hindus
used spades, crowbars and their bare hands to tear down a 16th
century mosque.</LD>
<TE>   Many Hindus believe that Lord Rama, an incarnation of the god
Vishnu, was born at the site and that Mughal emperor Babar built the
mosque on the ruins of a Hindu temple he ordered desecrated.</TE>
<TE>   The demolition triggered riots that killed 2,000 people. Since
then, Hindu hard-liners have campaigned and collected donations to
build a majestic temple on the site in Ayodhya, about 350 miles east
of New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   But the government, led by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's
Hindu nationalist party, has barred any construction on the disputed
site until the country's Supreme Court rules on a number of
petitions.</TE>
<TE>   The chief of the World Hindu Council, Ashok Singhal, led hundreds
of people on a march Sunday through Ayodhya's side streets, from the
prayer site to the banks of the Saryu River.</TE>
<TE>   There, a dozen men and women poured sacred water out of ceremonial
pots into the river.</TE>
<TE>   At the prayer site outside a small, temporary temple built near
the spot where the mosque stood, more than 7,000 devotees from
several Indian states offered flowers and clarified butter to a
sacred fireplace, in a centuries-old Hindu ceremony.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Former King Mohammad Zaher Shah postponed a trip to two Afghan cities
Sunday because of illness, a spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Zaher Shah, 87, returned to Afghanistan in April after three
decades in exile. He had been planning to visit the southern city of
Kandahar and the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.</LD>
<LD>   Zaher Shah is "a little sick. As soon as he is OK, we will go to
Kandahar," said his secretary, Amid Saddiq. He declined to elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   Yousaf Pashtoon, spokesman for Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai,
said the trip would probably be postponed at least 15 days, until
after a grand council is held in Kabul to choose a new government.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah has said he does not want the monarchy restored, but he
has not ruled out serving as head of state if asked. However, he has
said he doesn't want to be the head of the government.</TE>

<HD>In Jittery Gaza, Till Peace Do They Stay Apart</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian couples are putting off their
weddings, both out of invasion worries and a desire to respect the
communal gloom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Samir Shorrab and Najwa Sayes look sheepishly at each other across
the coffee shop table and giggle as they describe how, with God's
will, their destinies became intertwined: how he dialed her cell
phone number by mistake, heard her voice and kept calling back with
excuse after excuse until she finally agreed to meet him and become
engaged.</LD>
<LD>   That was a year ago. As the intifada rages and the Gaza Strip's
1.2 million people brace for a threatened Israeli invasion at any
time, few things seem more inappropriate or out of reach to many
young people these days than a wedding.</LD>
<LD>   "It's so frustrating, we both have holes in our hearts right now,"
Shorrab says. "But whenever we think about holding our wedding party,
we worry about shelling. How can you hold such a joyous event under
these circumstances?"</LD>
<TE>   The risk of large groups getting hit prompted the Palestinian
Authority in April to impose a weeklong ban on weddings. Even without
the restrictions, however, most people simply aren't in the mood
these days, as even small details become an ordeal. Shorrab's family
lives several miles south of Gaza City, for instance, which means
there's no assurance his relatives could make it through the military
checkpoints to attend the festivities.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Authority officials confirm that weddings are on the
decline, although they have no statistics to offer. But Gaza Strip
residents say it doesn't take a calculator to see what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   Salah abu Haseira, owner of Alsalam Restaurant and Wedding
Banquets, sits in his empty hall looking out over the sea. Normally
he'd have 90 weddings booked by May, running through late August.
Last month he had just four. Grooms who used to spend $1,500 for the
hall, dinner, a cake, flowers and a band now make do on a $300
bare-bones plan without food or live music. "It's the worst we've
ever seen" during a half-century in business, Haseira says.</TE>
<TE>   Among the biggest hurdles for young suitors in the Gaza Strip, an
area economically depressed at the best of times, is the loss of
jobs. Unemployment has spiked to 60% in a society where men are
expected to bring a house, a steady income and a dowry of up to
several thousand dollars to the wedding table.</TE>
<TE>   'Most Young Men Don't Even Go Looking'</TE>
<TE>   While some sheiks have called for a sharp reduction in dowry
levels, that solves only part of the problem. The Israeli lock-down
of Gaza, the destruction of factories and government buildings and
the end of lucrative jobs in Israel has sharply diminished what most
men can offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people like me want a wife and a nice house, but there's no
way these days," says Khalil Mosahaod, 27, a graphic designer who
lost his job in Israel when hostilities flared nearly two years ago
and now spends his days hanging out at his brother's struggling taxi
company. "Since it's out of the question, most young men don't even
go looking."</TE>
<TE>   Even those who can afford it are under great pressure to show
solidarity with the community at a time when many friends and
relatives have been killed and the Gaza Strip bracketed by military
checkpoints. Mohammed Salman, a 22-year-old electronics technician,
recently came under sharp criticism when he went ahead with a
high-profile 200-guest ceremony despite the prevalent mood.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I regret we had that kind of wedding," he says. "I really
didn't expect that kind of reaction."</TE>
<TE>   In more peaceful days, Gaza City's traffic was regularly snarled
by parades of cars and taxis blaring their horns exuberantly behind
the bridal car. Nowadays, those few tying the knot slip quietly into
the hall in separate cars or shun the public eye completely with
family weddings at home.</TE>
<TE>   Wedding halls aren't the only ones feeling the pinch. Formal
apparel retailer Fares International Wear and portrait-maker Alnaji
Photos say it's hardly worth opening their shops these days. And
neighboring Tarzi Jewelers has seen business decline by 90%, with
some customers even pawning their rings immediately after the
ceremony to buy basic necessities.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no happiness in people's hearts," owner Hani Tarzi, 44,
says. "People just aren't confident about their futures anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Family structure and strong tradition also play a part.</TE>
<TE>   "In the West, the 'I' is very strong, while here the "we" is very
strong," says Shahir Yagi, a psychological counselor. "There are no
outright taboos against weddings, celebrating or having fun, but
people don't want to stand out."</TE>
<TE>   Though more young Muslims are meeting their future spouses without
the help of intermediaries, mothers armed with wish lists provided by
their sons still help arrange many marriages.</TE>
<TE>   Upheaval has often weakened social strictures during key periods
of history, but family experts say the hostilities are having the
opposite effect on Palestinian society. Marriage-related traditions
remain strong, they add, including the practice of having both
families pre-approve any future spouse before courtship and requiring
a male relative's approval before a woman can marry.</TE>
<TE>   "Women are restricted by law, not just tradition," says Andaleeb
Adwan, a coordinator with the Gaza Women's Affairs Center. "If
anything, all the uncertainty surrounding the intifada makes
tradition more important, as people look to their families and what
they know for protection and support."</TE>
<TE>   Freedom Today to Reject Parents' Picks</TE>
<TE>   That's not to suggest that longer-term evolutionary changes aren't
affecting marriage, experts add, as seen by restaurateur Haseira's
example.</TE>
<TE>   When Haseira's father was 15, he was pressured to marry a woman he
didn't know. When that union turned out to be less than ideal, he
took a second wife, also arranged, ending up with more than a dozen
children. Haseira, on the other hand, was free to veto several of his
mother's choices. Now he jokes that he'll be lucky if his son even
invites him to his wedding.</TE>
<TE>   For Shorrab and Sayes, every month that goes by seems like a
generation. Both are accountants and blessed with jobs. But his
salary supports his extended family back in the village--80% of Gaza
now lives in poverty--and he's worried that his company could
announce layoffs any time. Sayes has a more secure government job,
but her paychecks are running three weeks late as the government
falls deeper into debt.</TE>
<TE>   As they wait for the war clouds to disappear, the two laugh at how
fate brought them together.</TE>
<TE>   She scolded him when he first misdialed, but the next day he got
up his courage and called back. She let slip that they were in the
same profession, so he started calling her back with work-related
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually she dropped her guard enough to meet him unescorted at
a coffee shop, a rather daring move in traditional Muslim society.
That led to the expected family meeting and immediate court filing.</TE>
<TE>   While they're technically married, by law and tradition the union
isn't consummated until a wedding party dispenses the community's
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   As time drags on, they've debated having a modest home wedding but
ultimately decided they want it to be a day to remember. In the
meantime, they meet almost every day to chat, discuss work and talk
about wedding details.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a long time to be engaged and not married," she says.
"We've had lots of time to plan our wedding. I wish we had a lot less
planning time."</TE>

<LD>   Medical Examiner O.C. Smith escaped Saturday night's attack with
minor injuries. Police said it appeared that it would have been
possible for the device to explode.</LD>
<LD>   The explosive appeared similar to a crude bomb found in March in a

Smith was attacked, but noted that he has helped in several criminal

<LD>More former inmates are getting rearrested after being released from
prison than a decade ago, the Justice Department reported.</LD>
<LD>   Convicted car thieves and burglars were more likely to be arrested
again than those who had served time for murder or sexual assault, a
department study found. Younger people and those with longer criminal
records also were more likely to be rearrested.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, more than 67% of former inmates released from state
prisons in 1994 were arrested again within three years, up from more
than 62% in 1983, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported.</LD>

<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former president of Afghanistan was removed from a transatlantic
flight when security screeners mistakenly interpreted a comment he
made as a threat.</LD>
<LD>   Sibghatullah Mojaddedi was pulled out of a boarding line Friday
for a Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to London for a baggage
search, FBI agent Wendy Evans said. Mojaddedi assumed he was singled
out because he was wearing traditional Afghan clothing.</LD>
<LD>   Airport security screeners said they heard him mention an Islamic
liberation organization and say, "I know you're looking for a bomb."</LD>
<TE>   The comments were made in English but misinterpreted by the
screeners, neither of whom spoke English as a first language, Evans
said.</TE>
<TE>   The airline rebooked him in first class on a Saturday flight,
airline spokesman John Riordan said. "Post 9/11, everybody is being
extra vigilant, and sometimes things get misconstrued," Riordan said.</TE>

<HD>Therapeutic Cloning Gets Boost in Implant Study</HD>
<DH>Science: Cow organs function normally and aren't rejected,
researchers say. The finding comes as a Senate vote looms over
banning the procedure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have demonstrated for the first time that cloned tissues
and organs can be implanted and function normally without being
rejected, an achievement that brings therapeutic cloning one step
closer to fruition.</LD>
<LD>   Working with cloned cow cells, the scientists produced small
replacement kidneys that filtered toxic materials from the
bloodstream of a cow and produced urine. They also created beating
heart tissue that eventually might be used to repair damaged hearts
in much the same manner that patches are used to repair bicycle inner
tubes.</LD>
<LD>   The results, to be published in the July issue of Nature
Biotechnology but available online today, provide an important "proof
of principle" that cloned organs can survive and thrive in
recipients, said Dr. Anthony Atala of Children's Hospital Boston, who
is one of the researchers.</LD>
<TE>   Some critics of therapeutic cloning have speculated that cloned
tissues would be rejected because they contain foreign DNA from a
donated egg used in the cloning process. That small amount of foreign
DNA could be enough to stimulate an immune response leading to
rejection, critics said, but the new study shows that this does not
necessarily happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Before now, therapeutic cloning as a means of preventing
rejection was criticized by some as being purely theoretical--just an
idea," said Dr. Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology Inc.,
another of the paper's authors.</TE>
<TE>   "This study furnishes the first scientific evidence that cloned
tissues can be transplanted back into animals without being destroyed
by the body's immune system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 3,000 Americans die every day from diseases that could
possibly be treated by therapeutic cloning, according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Much larger numbers could
have a greatly improved quality of life if they received replacement
tissues and organs produced by the technique.</TE>
<TE>   By 2010, for example, it is estimated that at least 2 million
Americans will suffer from end-stage kidney disease that could be
treated with artificial kidneys produced by therapeutic cloning. The
new results suggest those kidneys are on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Therapeutic cloning involves taking DNA from the nucleus of skin
or other cells from the prospective recipient and implanting it in a
donated egg cell from which the DNA has been removed. That cell then
becomes the equivalent of a fertilized egg and can grow into
embryonic tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, the embryo could be implanted into a surrogate
mother and grown into a fetus. But in therapeutic cloning, the small
mass of cells is used as a source of stem cells, which have the
ability to grow into a variety of adult tissues.</TE>
<TE>   The new findings come as the Senate is gearing up for a vote about
whether to ban human cloning in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The House has passed a bill banning all forms of human cloning,
and President Bush has supported it strongly. The Senate is
considering two competing bills, one that would ban all forms of
human cloning and one that would ban human cloning for reproductive
purposes but not research purposes such as therapeutic cloning.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate appears to be evenly split between the two bills.
Proponents of therapeutic cloning hope that the new results might
sway more senators toward their position.</TE>
<TE>   In the new research, a team from Advanced Cell Technology and
Children's Hospital Boston obtained cow eggs (oocytes) and removed
and discarded the eggs' DNA.</TE>
<TE>   In its place, they implanted nuclear DNA from skin cells taken
from the ears of adult cows. The cells were then induced to become
embryonic cell masses that were transferred into surrogate mother
cows for a five- to six-week incubation period.</TE>
<TE>   This step was necessary because researchers do not yet know how to
induce bovine embryonic stem cells to become specific organs.
Scientists know how to do this with human cells, however, and the
cell masses used for human therapeutic cloning would not have to be
implanted into surrogate mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks after implantation, heart, skeletal muscle and kidney
cells from the cow embryos were collected and grown in the
laboratory. These were then seeded onto three-dimensional scaffolds
in the shape of kidneys and other organs. These structures were then
implanted into the cows from which the DNA was obtained.</TE>
<TE>   The results were "pretty spectacular," Lanza said. Not only were
the tissues not rejected, but they spontaneously grew into
functioning organs.</TE>
<TE>   The kidney cells, for example, grew into a small kidney that
became connected to the body's blood system. These kidneys removed
toxic materials from the blood stream with about 60% of a natural
kidney's efficiency and dumped them into a straw-colored urine, Lanza
said.</TE>
<TE>   The kidneys also produced critical hormones and vitamins that are
normally produced by the natural organs.</TE>
<TE>   The next step, said Atala, is to grow larger organs that might be
used to replace the natural kidneys. "This was just a first step, and
there is still a lot of work that needs to be done," he said. "It's
hard to predict a time scale now."</TE>

<HD>Mourners Gather for Final Farewell</HD>
<DH>Ground zero: Prayers, poetry mark event, which was
organized for those who couldn't attend Thursday's official end to
search.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>While Thursday marked the official end to New York's recovery efforts
at the World Trade Center site, Sunday offered several hundred family
members of the Sept. 11 victims a chance to say final goodbyes.</LD>
<LD>   Jewish and Christian religious leaders, standing at a lectern
covered with photographs of people killed in the terrorist attacks on
the twin towers, led the crowd in a simple interfaith service of
hymns, poetry and prayers.</LD>
<LD>   A candle was lighted in memory of the victims, and nine white
doves were released to soar over the gaping hole where the World
Trade Center once stood.</LD>
<TE>   The half-hour service was organized for family members who
couldn't attend Thursday's end to the recovery efforts. That ceremony
drew thousands of rescue workers, police and firefighters, as well as
victims' relatives. Some criticized the decision to hold the ceremony
on a weekday, when many had to be at work.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning's service was a much more private affair. Former
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) were
among the few officials who attended, but they didn't speak. Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg was invited but declined to attend. "I don't
want to politicize anything," he said Friday on his weekly radio
show.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 2,823 people killed in the New York attack, including those
on the planes that crashed into the towers, just more than 1,100 have
been identified by the medical examiner.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel my niece is always going to be here," William Healey said.
"They haven't found any remains, and we don't expect them to."</TE>
<TE>   The search for remains is continuing at the Fresh Kills Landfill
on Staten Island, where truckloads of debris from the 16-acre site
have been taken. DNA tests also are continuing on thousands of
recovered body parts.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, family members, some wearing suits but many more in
shirt sleeves and baseball caps, held aloft photographs of loved ones
as the ceremony began with what has become a familiar refrain in New
York: bagpipers playing "Amazing Grace."</TE>
<TE>   Four candles were lighted: one for those lost in the terrorist
attacks; one for family members; one to thank the rescue workers,
construction crews and volunteers; and a final one for peace.</TE>
<TE>   After more hymns and a poem, the crowd, some of whom were in
tears, sang "God Bless America." A blessing of the site and more
prayers closed the ceremony.</TE>

<HD>Congress to Probe Lapses on Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: A joint panel will convene this week to look at
what the U.S. authorities knew and didn't know before the Sept. 11
attacks, and why.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The first full-scale congressional inquiry into the Sept. 11 attacks,
due to start behind closed doors Tuesday, will seek to determine what
U.S. authorities knew about Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and,
perhaps more important, why they didn't know and do more.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the House and Senate intelligence committees said
Sunday that the long-delayed joint probe would examine communication
lapses involving the CIA and the FBI, as well as immigration,
aviation and other government agencies, that allowed possible clues
of the impending attacks to go unnoticed.</LD>
<LD>   One such lapse is why the CIA failed to alert the FBI and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to watch for Khalid Almihdhar
after he was secretly photographed at a meeting with a suspected Al
Qaeda operative in January 2000 in Malaysia.</LD>
<TE>   The CIA waited until Aug. 23, 2001, to ask the INS to add
Almihdhar's name to a "watch list" used to bar suspected terrorists
and others from entering the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Almihdhar and another suspect, Nawaf Alhazmi, had been
living openly for several months in the U.S. and had enrolled in
flight schools. The CIA then told the FBI, but the bureau was unable
to find the men before they helped hijack American Airlines Flight 77
and crash it into the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "There was information that could have allowed us to put
[Almihdhar] on the watch list earlier," a senior U.S. intelligence
official said Sunday. "It didn't get done."</TE>
<TE>   The official said the issue "undoubtedly will come up" in the
congressional hearings. "Some of the documents and information on
this are among the 350,000 pages we've made available" to
congressional investigators. "I'm sure they'll want to ask and talk
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Although the communication breakdown was reported by The Times and
other publications in the fall, a Newsweek report this week adds
several new details.</TE>
<TE>   The lapse is the latest to roil the national security community
and adds fresh pressure to calls for stronger congressional scrutiny
of the often-bitter rivalry between the U.S.' chief spy service and
its top law enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Sunday that the CIA and the FBI are
"working in a significantly better way" than before. "Reports that
used to be generated, that were almost competitive between the one
agency and the other, are now jointly generated," Ashcroft said on
CNN's "Late Edition," one of three network talk shows on which he
appeared Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has taken the heaviest fire in recent weeks. Top officials
ignored warnings in July from a Phoenix field agent about Middle
Eastern men training at American flight schools. The bureau also
denied requests from the Minneapolis field office in August for help
in investigating Zacarias Moussaoui, who was later charged with
conspiracy for his alleged role in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said, however, that the slew of missed clues probably
were not enough to have averted the attacks. "My view is that the
information we now have does not indicate that there was a
substantial likelihood of detecting this," he said on ABC's "This
Week."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III announced new
surveillance guidelines last week that will sharply increase the
FBI's ability to monitor libraries, mosques, political rallies,
Internet sites and other public places to search for intelligence
about possible terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said the new rules would allow the FBI to "listen to
what's happening in public places in our community," including
"bomb-making sites" on the Internet. "Any 12-year-old child can do
it," he told "Fox News Sunday." "The FBI ought to be able to do it."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), ranking member of the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, questioned whether
the FBI needed new powers to collect intelligence on U.S. citizens,
given its failure to correctly analyze the information it had
received before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk a great deal about connecting the dots," she said on
NBC's "Meet The Press." "Well, they didn't even see the dots. They
don't understand the salience of the dots. The dots were there. It
wasn't a question of needing more collection on American citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), vice chairman of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence, said on the same program that the
nation needs "a thorough, credible investigation of all our
intelligence agencies: what they knew, what they didn't know, what do
they need?"</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee and a former CIA employee, complained recent news reports
have hampered the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem we're having now is that we're looking and focusing
on one little corner ... of the tapestry at a time as things leak
out," Goss said on "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   The panel will hold its first closed hearing Tuesday in a special
Senate chamber that has soundproofed doors and walls. The first
public hearings are tentatively planned for mid-June.</TE>

<HD>Democrats' Old Habits Resurfacing in Plans to Win Congress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Something old. Something old. Something old. Something old.</LD>
<LD>   And, incidentally, something new.</LD>
<LD>   That is what congressional Democrats have produced in the
five-point plan they are taking to voters for this year's midterm
election.</LD>
<TE>   In case you missed it, Democrats last month produced a five-point
message card meant to show the priorities they would pursue if given
majorities in the House and Senate this fall.</TE>
<TE>   It's a document Walter F. Mondale would have felt comfortable
distributing. The plan reflects almost none of the new thinking
former President Clinton promoted during his two terms (which is
surprising, since the usually perceptive John Podesta, Clinton's
former White House chief of staff, supervised the project).</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it seems inspired more by Al Gore's ill-fated 2000
campaign, which drifted back toward the old Democratic strategy of
wooing interest groups with targeted programs. This new effort is
less likely to be remembered as the launch of a Democratic
renaissance than as a testament to the party's confusion 18 months
after Gore's defeat.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise began with private grumbling among key Democratic
interest groups last winter, who feared that the party's message was
being lost amid the focus on the war against terrorism and persistent
gridlock on the Senate floor. That concern inspired a project, led by
Podesta, involving operatives from all of the party committees. Last
month, after extensive internal discussion and some national polling,
the group settled on five issues it believes Democrats at all levels
should stress in the midterm election.</TE>
<TE>   Four of them are long-standing party priorities: protecting Social
Security and opposing Republican efforts to partially privatize it;
creating a prescription drug benefit for seniors under Medicare;
increasing spending on education; toughening enforcement of clean air
and clean water laws. The something (relatively) new is a pledge to
"provide real pension protection" in the wake of the Enron Corp.
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Democrats will place each of these issues on the marquee.
But the plan's influence is already apparent. On Wednesdays, a group
of 22 Democratic senators meet to discuss ways to promote the five
issues. The priorities are visible in individual campaigns too,
through gambits like the "seniors' bill of rights"--centered on
opposition to Social Security privatization and the promise of a new
prescription drug benefit--that embattled Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.)
released last week.</TE>
<TE>   In producing this list, Podesta's group labored under several
constraints. One was the difficulty of finding issues to unite
congressional Democrats, especially Senate Democrats. A bolder
agenda--say one that talked about restoring fiscal balance by
trimming President Bush's tax cut--would have inevitably proved more
divisive. The plan was also shaped by the conventional wisdom that
elderly voters matter more in low-turnout midterm elections; as a
result, it's disproportionately weighted toward seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even with those explanations, the agenda still seems a
stunning leap backward into pre-Clinton liberalism. The list does
indeed embody broadly shared Democratic priorities. But it is more
revealing for what isn't included than what is. It abandons, without
a fight, Clinton's attempt to identify the party with national
strength, government reform and economic growth--foundations of his
effort to expand the Democratic coalition.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the plan offers no ideas on the issue at the top of
the public's agenda: fighting terrorism. As such, it reflects the
conventional wisdom among top party strategists such as James
Carville, Stanley B. Greenberg and Robert Shrum, who have argued for
months that Democrats should talk about terrorism only long enough to
say "I agree with the president" and then change the subject to
domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   That calculation seems odd, and risky, for Democrats. It accepts a
reversion to the "division of labor" that characterized American
politics when Republicans dominated the White House from 1968 to
1988. Democrats seem to be conceding national strength issues to
Republicans while placing all their chips on compassion issues, like
health care or protecting the elderly, where polls give them a lead.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Democrats in the incongruous position of focusing
least on the subject that most concerns Americans: safeguarding the
nation. "Voters will not take Democrats seriously as a party to be
entrusted with national leadership if they fail to address the most
urgent set of national issues," the centrist Democratic Leadership
Council wrote recently.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem is that the plan says nothing about modernizing
government. Clinton usually linked new spending to government reform
(think welfare or the balanced budget). But like Gore in 2000, the
new Democratic agenda trumpets spending while muting reform. The plan
says nothing about how Democrats would restructure Medicare to
control costs or how the party hopes to solve Social Security's
long-range financing problems; it merely, like Gore, promises more
money. Which could allow Republicans to accuse their Democratic
opponents of reverting to big-spending liberalism--as Bush did, with
devastating effect, to Gore.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the plan offers no vision of how to promote economic
growth. Last year, House and Senate leaders touted a comprehensive
plan to revive growth in the technology economy; Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) last week released a detailed paper on options
for spurring the economy by encouraging the spread of Internet
broadband technology. Not a word of that appears in the new
five-point plan.</TE>
<TE>   Podesta, who understands the document's limits, has told friends
he sees this as a blueprint only for the off-year election, not for
winning back the White House. To a point, he's right: Both parties
usually bend toward their base in midterm elections. (Bush and
congressional Republicans aren't lighting the sky with bold new
ideas, either.) But the plan underscores the Democratic regression
toward old habits that kept the party out of the White House for 20
of the 24 years before Clinton. Odds are the next Democratic
presidential nominee won't be building on this retro agenda; he'll be
laboring to dig out from under it.</TE>

<LD>An experimental anthrax antidote has protected rats injected with the
bacterium's deadly toxin, researchers said in this month's issue of
Nature Biotechnology.</LD>
<LD>   The research targets anthrax's late stage, which is beyond
treatment and often is fatal. Anthrax infection can be treated with
antibiotics in its early stages, but victims rarely know they are
infected until it's too late, after the anthrax bacteria have flooded
the bloodstream with three deadly toxins.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Texas researchers reported that they genetically
engineered a mouse protein that intercepts the toxins before they can
reach their usual target of healthy blood cells.</LD>

<LD>Plant-eating dinosaurs of different species may have herded together
to escape meat eaters, according to an analysis of
163-million-year-old dinosaur footprints on a muddy coastal plain in
England.</LD>
<LD>   In Friday's issue of Science, British researchers said that 40
tracks of dinosaur footprints hint at a life-and-death struggle
between prey and hunter.</LD>
<LD>   The tracks suggest that large plant eaters of different
types--some as long as 90 feet and weighing 10 tons or more--walked
together on an open tidal plain, perhaps fleeing for their lives.</LD>
<TE>   On a nearby track, the researchers also found the footprints of
the smaller, faster megalosaurus, a toothy meat eater that may have
been more than 60 feet long. The tracks were going the same direction
at about the same time as the plant eaters.</TE>
<TE>   The tracks of the megalosaurs suggest that they were tracking the
plant eaters, paleontologist Julia Day of the University of Cambridge
said.</TE>

<HD>Partial Eclipse Will Darken Area Sky</HD>

<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A partial eclipse of the sun will be visible from Los Angeles--and
most of North America--late in the afternoon of June 10. This will be
the last solar eclipse visible from Los Angeles until 2012.</LD>
<LD>   Solar eclipses occur when the moon passes between Earth and the
sun.</LD>
<LD>   During Monday's eclipse, the moon will eventually block 71% of the
sun. The sky will darken noticeably but not dramatically.</LD>
<TE>   The eclipse will begin at 5:13 p.m., reach its maximum at 6:22 and
end by 7:23--half an hour before sunset.</TE>
<TE>   It is not safe to look at the sun during a partial eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   "The sun will still be one-quarter uneclipsed, and that's too
bright," said John Mosley, an astronomer at Griffith Observatory.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple telescopes will be set up for public viewing on the lawn
of the observatory, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The observatory building is closed for renovation, but the lawn
will be open.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the last public astronomical viewing event at the
observatory until it reopens in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The eclipse can also be viewed safely through solar filters that
are sold at astronomical and optical supply houses and some specialty
stores.</TE>
<TE>   As a backup, viewers can project the eclipse through binoculars
onto a white card or piece of paper, Mosley said.</TE>
<TE>   He warned against using expensive binoculars or letting them get
too hot, as the lenses can become unglued.</TE>
<TE>   People in a narrow path stretching across the Pacific Ocean from
near Borneo to the western edge of Mexico will be able to see a rare
annular, or ring, eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   More information on the eclipse and an eclipse video are available
at www.griffithobs.org/solar eclipse.html</TE>

<HD>Fly Trials of 1950s Evolve</HD>
<DH>Research: The notion that genes shape behavior was
discounted. Scientists are taking another look.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in the 1950s, a biologist named Jerry Hirsch embarked on an odd
but trailblazing endeavor: He coaxed flies to crawl and fly through
elaborate mazes so as to separate ones that prefer to move up from
ones that prefer to move down.</LD>
<LD>   In those days, psychologists pooh-poohed the notion that genes
could help shape behavior, believing instead that all behaviors were
learned. Hirsch's lovingly selected lines of high- and low-seeking
fruit flies forced them to think again.</LD>
<LD>   Hirsch is long retired; descendants of his original flies
languished in a few bottles filled with yeasty food. Now, at last,
they are back in the limelight--and blazing trails again.</LD>
<TE>   Today, scientists are probing Hirsch's strange flies with modern
molecular tools to try to answer what could never be answered before:
Why do some of Hirsch's flies fly up? And why do the others fly down?
What kinds of genetic changes was Hirsch selecting for all those
years?</TE>
<TE>   Writing today in the journal Nature Genetics, a team of
researchers say they've pinpointed several of the genes involved in
this trait--and have strong clues about some others.</TE>
<TE>   And that is important for more than just fans of fruit fly
behavior. While some genes studied by scientists have large,
in-your-face influences, many more have small and subtle
contributions. Hirsch's flies are a prime example of the kind of
trait that involves the action of many genes.</TE>
<TE>   Studying the flies, therefore, stands to teach scientists lessons
about the genetic nuts and bolts of evolution as well as the ancient
art of plant and animal breeding.</TE>
<TE>   For eons--long before recorded history--people have domesticated
animals, deliberately selecting for traits such as docility,
disease-resistance, milk production and more.</TE>
<TE>   Studies such as the one of Hirsch's flies "finally give us a way
to see what the genes are that are contributing to the selection,"
said Tim Tully, professor of genetics at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory in Long Island, N.Y., and a former graduate student of
Hirsch's.</TE>
<TE>   The studies demonstrate how scientists can more easily get their
hands on agriculturally important genes--ones that often are hard to
find because dozens, even hundreds, are involved in a trait, each one
contributing just a little.</TE>
<TE>   Central to these new lines of investigation is the development of
high-tech DNA computer chips, which are loaded with samples of
thousands of genes, allowing scientists to quickly probe huge chunks
of a genome.</TE>
<TE>   The chips could potentially allow agricultural researchers to
ferret out specific genes more readily, easing the quest to breed
beefier cattle or fungus-resistant lettuce.</TE>
<TE>   Such studies already are underway for a variety of crops and
livestock, said Max Rothschild, the Curtiss distinguished professor
of agriculture, animal breeding and genetics at Iowa State University
in Ames. The experiments with Hirsch's flies are an important
demonstration that the approach works.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inventive, revealing, really innovative stuff," Rothschild
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch started his project while in graduate school in the 1950s,
working with a scientist who was breeding smart and dumb lines of
rats. Hirsch also wanted to study behavior--but decided that fruit
flies were handier to use. The flies were small, well-studied and
fast breeding: Flat out, they could manage a generation every 10
days.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, flies do exhibit behaviors--including "geotaxis," or
the preference to move in relation to the pull of gravity.</TE>
<TE>   When the flies are in their larval stage, for instance, they like
to move downward. That way they'll burrow ever deeper into the
pungent, moldy fruit they adore.</TE>
<TE>   When the time comes to pupate, they change their tune--heading up
out of their food to a nice, dry place where the fly can emerge
safely when it's time to hatch.</TE>
<TE>   And, as anyone who's opened a smelly garbage can or tried to swat
a fly knows, flies like to fly up to safety when startled.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that, who knows?" said Ralph Greenspan, Cullman Fellow
in Experimental Neurobiology at the Neurosciences Institute in San
Diego, and senior author of the paper published today. "You'd have to
put yourself into their heads and think like them."</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch, in any case, didn't need to probe the fly's psyche: He
just needed a way to gauge its preferences. And so he constructed a
cunning maze shaped like a candelabrum turned on its side. Into one
end, he loaded a fine mix of flies. Then he waited as they slowly
moved through it.</TE>
<TE>   At numerous points in the maze, each fly had a choice: Go up or go
down. Valve-like cones discouraged any backtracking. At the far end
of the maze, each fly ended up in one of a series of tubes, each at a
different height.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, flies chose pretty randomly: Most ended up in the
middle set of tubes.</TE>
<TE>   But after every run through the maze, Hirsch enriched his
population of outliers: flies that ended up highest and flies that
ended up lowest. He'd use these outliers as the parents for the next
generation.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Hirsch (now emeritus professor of the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) would re-select those lines, cataloging
his findings in a succession of scholarly papers with titles such as
"Genetic changes occurring over 500 generations in lines of
Drosophila melanogaster selected divergently for geotaxis."
Generations of students helped out with the task.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there was only so much Hirsch could do with the flies. He knew
that through his breeding he'd selected for many different genes that
all played small parts in this particular fly behavior. But he could
never get his hands on them.</TE>
<TE>   And so the lines sat. But Hirsch did not: Over the years, he
turned his eye toward other fly behaviors: courtship, speed of
running, ability to learn, and more. His lab became a mecca for those
enthralled by the quirky side of fruit fly life.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the molecular genetic revolution. In 2000, scientists
reported they'd cataloged the structure of the fruit fly's genome
with its roughly 14,000 genes. That, in turn, allowed the creation of
Drosophila DNA chips, containing thousands of points, each
representing one of those genes.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a scientist can bathe those chips with extracts of fly
tissues to figure out which genes are turned on or off in different
samples.</TE>
<TE>   In the study reported today, Daniel Toma of the Neurosciences
Institute and Kevin White of Yale University, as well as Greenspan
and Hirsch, describe just such a DNA chip analysis. The chip, created
by White, contains DNA spots representing more than a third of all
the fly's genes.</TE>
<TE>   The team bathed the chip in brain extracts from high-seeking flies
and low-seeking flies, and looked for differences in the patterns of
brightly colored spots. These would represent differences in the
amount of activity in each of the genes. They found differences in
250 genes.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, they studied four in much more detail: testing fruit
flies known to have defects in those genes for their preferences
while wandering through one of Hirsch's mazes.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the mutants, they found, walked through the maze in ways
detectably different from "normal" flies--two of them emerging at the
other end slightly high, one emerging slightly too low. These genes,
the scientists argue, could well be among the ones that Hirsch
selected for, way back when.</TE>
<TE>   It's no mean feat to identify three genes involved in a trait
you're studying in one fell swoop, Rothschild said.</TE>
<TE>   But the study is interesting for other reasons too. These three
genes, Greenspan notes, have other jobs that have nothing to do with
geotaxis--traits such as moving and resting in crisp, daily rhythms.
It's a fine illustration of the way that nature multi-tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not one of them that you could consider a 'geotaxis
gene'--they're all doing other things as well," Greenspan said.</TE>
<TE>   Evolution, he said, probably works by making small, subtle changes
in this gene and that gene, so as to alter one behavior without
messing up other essential functions.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, the scientists plan to explore Hirsch's "high" and

<LD>Question: What cases a "lump" in my throat when I get emotional?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Emotions can increase tension in the muscles in the lower
part of your throat, called the pharynx. As the muscle tightens in
response, it sends a message to the brain indicating that something
is in your throat. But it is simply a case of mistaken identity.
Nothing is actually there. The medical name for this condition is
globus syndrome. When the emotions pass, the lump fades as well.</LD>

<HD>Faith Goes Undiminished in Quest for a New Church</HD>
<DH>Land use: Cottonwood congregants are joined by others in
Cypress who denounce the city's condemnation of their parcel for a
retail center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rhonda Morford emerged from an hour of energized prayer and song in
the crowded auditorium of Cottonwood Christian Center on Sunday with
a clear vision about the controversy surrounding her church.</LD>
<LD>   "This is good versus evil," she said. "It is black and white.
There is no gray here.... Satan is trying to stop our new church from
being built."</LD>
<LD>   To Morford and many fellow congregants, Satan has taken the shape
of a Cypress City Council vote to condemn 18 acres where Cottonwood
plans to build a "megachurch," so a sales-tax-revenue-generating
Costco or other retail store can be built there.</LD>
<TE>   But it's not just the 4,000-member congregation and its religious
allies who are urging the city to find another place for a new
shopping district.</TE>
<TE>   A backlash against the City Council is brewing from the very
Cypress taxpayers whom the Costco is supposed to benefit with more
than $700,000 a year projected in sales tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Some say they are embarrassed by the national attention--and
ridicule--the city's move to condemn the church-owned land has
attracted.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Racine said it's a constant source of chatter among the
customers he sees as an employee of Mervyn's on Valley View Street.
"People keep saying this just isn't fair, and they want the City
Council voted out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They think it's flat-out the church's land. There is already a
Costco 15 minutes away, for crying out loud."</TE>
<TE>   Melanie Cleveland is hearing the same thing from those who come
into the Petco where she works across the street. "I'm talking to a
lot of people who say they just don't think it is right," she said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials show no sign of backing down. They claim they are
the victims of an orchestrated public-relations campaign intended to
mislead residents about the facts of the case.</TE>
<TE>   To City Council members, it is simple: The land has been part of a
redevelopment zone since 1990, they say, and Cottonwood was warned
before buying a prime parcel at Walker Street and Katella Avenue that
a large church was not compatible with the city's vision.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials deny a warning was ever made.</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric has become heated. A mailing from an Oklahoma group
in support of Cottonwood depicted the City Council as mean, greedy
and immoral. Hundreds of Cottonwood members have dutifully appeared
to picket, chant and pray repeatedly in front of the council
chambers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a drawn-out battle," said Larry Matteson, a pastor at
Cottonwood.</TE>
<TE>   While the church's efforts have swayed some in Cypress, others
find the tone of it all quite offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone comes on that strong, it sends a signal to me that I
need to take it all with a grain of salt," said Cherie Dickey, 47, of
Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   "I have strong doubts about the believability of it all."</TE>
<TE>   Still others say they don't know what to think.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially, we felt the property should not be taken away," said
Fritz Friederich, 73, who was out grocery shopping with his wife,
Nancy.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we are just confused."</TE>
<TE>   City officials have produced a letter they sent to the church a
few months before the property was purchased in 1999, warning that
the property was in a planned business district.</TE>
<TE>   But the letter also says the area could be rezoned to accommodate
a church with an amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders promise they will see the struggle through.
Cottonwood has outgrown its 36,000-square-foot facility in Los
Alamitos; it holds six services a week to accommodate thousands of
members. The 700-seat auditorium fills up quickly, and hundreds of
congregants must watch weekend services on closed-circuit TV in
overflow rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed facility in Cypress is nearly nine times as large as
the church's current building and would include an auditorium,
gymnasium, classrooms, day-care center and other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   At the church Sunday, congregants were further invigorated by a
videotaped statement about the property's condemnation from their
leader, Senior Pastor Bayless Conley, who was in Mexico for the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to keep trusting God," he said from the giant video
screen. "Things are going to work out."</TE>
<TE>   That's all many congregants said they needed to hear as they
shuffled out of the auditorium, into the jammed parking lot and onto
shuttle buses to their vehicles parked at a nearby middle school.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a test of our faith," said Cottonwood member Shirley
Taylor, 29.</TE>
<TE>   "We will stand together until the end."</TE>

<HD>Air National Guard Wing Gets a Lift From 1st New Cargo
Plane</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The C-130J Hercules is part of an updated fleet
that will expand the Port Hueneme unit's firefighting response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new firefighting and cargo plane has the 1,200 men and women of the
Channel Islands Air National Guard Station flying high. The arrival
of a $70-million C-130J Hercules, dedicated Sunday at the air station
in Port Hueneme, marks the first step in modernizing the unit's aging
fleet. Eleven more are expected to arrive over the next few years.</LD>
<LD>   The planes will enable the unit to be more responsive to calls to
fight fires throughout the West, officials said. Pilots are being
trained on the new aircraft, which arrived in Ventura County two
weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   "This should keep us going for another 40 years," said Col. Ed
Bellion, vice commander of the California Air National Guard's 146th
Airlift Wing. "It's like celebrating when you get a new car."</LD>
<TE>   Officials said the plane is the first new aircraft to join the
wing in its 80-year history and is part of an effort by the federal
government to upgrade the nation's four firefighting air guard units.
The others in Cheyenne, Wyo., Colorado Springs, Colo., and Charlotte,
N.C., already have the new planes, Bellion said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the unit's existing Hercules fleet--which came into
service in 1961 and 1962 and are older than most of the pilots flying
them--will be replaced by these larger, faster models, said Lt. Julio
Bermejo, a spokesman for the Channel Islands station.</TE>
<TE>   The airlift wing, a reserve unit of the Air Force, assists the
U.S. Forest Service and the state Department of Forestry in fighting
forest and brush fires by dropping retardant on rugged terrain
difficult to reach by land. The wing, which is stationed next to the
Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center, has flown more than 5,000
firefighting missions since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   When not battling blazes, the craft will serve as a cargo
transport for military missions, Bermejo said. The C-130J, which is
15-feet longer than a previous J model, is the latest in a line of
C-130 planes built by Lockheed Martin in Marietta, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   It requires only three crew members instead of five and can fly up
to 21% faster, said Master Sgt. Michael Drake, a spokesman for the
air wing. In addition, its cruising altitude is 40% higher and its
climbing time has been cut in half.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a point of pride," Bermejo said. "We're getting this plane
and the next generation of firefighting equipment. It means we'll be
in the community for a long time."</TE>

<HD>Students Receive Lessons From Workplace</HD>
<DH>Education: Unusual program at Moorpark College is the
subject of a major study and a recipient of federal funds to aid
career training.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 115 students who attend the High School at Moorpark College are
accustomed to feeling part of something special. After all, it isn't
every teenager who gets to spend his or her junior and senior years
on a college campus attending classes that don't begin until noon.</LD>
<LD>   So when their unusual school was selected recently as both a
national demonstration site for making career development part of a
secondary school curriculum and as the subject of a UC Berkeley
research study, most students reacted with aplomb.</LD>
<LD>   "They are used to the whole idea of being in the fishbowl, of
having people come in and observe," said Principal Andi Mallen.
"Teenagers can't see past Friday night, never mind two years from
now. I don't think they quite understand what this means for us yet."</LD>
<TE>   Moorpark College was one of nine community colleges in the nation
and the only one in California to be awarded a three-year vocational
education grant this year from the U.S. Department of Education. The
$566,000 grant is being used at the college's 2-year-old alternative
high school to build alliances with businesses and nonprofit agencies
that are willing to provide internships, professional mentors, office
tours and other lessons from the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   The High School at Moorpark College is run jointly by the Moorpark
Unified School District, Moorpark College and the community college
district.</TE>
<TE>   Judi Gould, the college's grant manager, said the pilot project is
intended not only to help students set career goals but also to let
them see that their studies have real-life applications. "We believe
that having a link to the business community is critical ... in terms
of helping them see the relevance of what they are doing and its
importance to their studies," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A team of researchers from the UC Berkeley Graduate School of
Education will be testing the validity of that hypothesis. The
researchers plan to track the high school students to evaluate
whether the career-based instruction they receive has any bearing on
their attitudes toward school and post-graduation success, said
Victoria Bortolussi, a dean of student learning at Moorpark College.</TE>
<TE>   Bortolussi said that in addition to paying for staff to cultivate
business partnerships, the grant money will allow the college to
infuse the high school's curriculum with work-related subject matter.
The school's seniors, for example, will be required to complete a
"career major" project combining their own research with classroom
lessons and a 10-week field experience.</TE>
<TE>   "We are basically looking to see if teaching in this way makes a
difference," Bortolussi said. "Are students more engaged in the
educational experience? Are they more successful in identifying and
meeting their goals? A major piece of this grant is to be a model, so
we want the model to be as experimental and creative as it can and
be, measuring it along the way so we can tell people if this works,
and if it does, how you can do it."</TE>
<TE>   Three businesses--Maxon Computer, a Germany-based animation
software company that has its North American headquarters in Newbury
Park; the Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System; and the
Diagnostic Imaging department of Los Robles Regional Medical Center
in Thousand Oaks--have pledged to be part of the program. An
additional 31 local businesses have expressed interest, Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Babb, president of Maxon USA, said his company employs about
half a dozen Moorpark College students as interns each year and holds
workshops and training courses at the college for students who are
interested in digital arts. The new grant will formalize that
relationship and possibly provide avenues for building on it, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been great for us because we have gotten some very talented
people to work here who started out as Moorpark College interns,"
Babb said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Gould, Moorpark College was chosen for the grant
because of its on-site high school, which is designed to serve a
handpicked group of "high-potential" students who may have struggled
in traditional schools. At Moorpark, they take a combination of high
school and community college classes and are afforded greater freedom
to select their own schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Another plus for the college in the grant competition was its four
career-themed "institutes," which were established four years ago to
give students a way of meeting their basic course requirements and
job training goals simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   All Moorpark College students have the option of enrolling in one
of the institutes--Health Sciences, Liberal Arts/Teaching, Media
Arts/Technology and Business--and taking English, math and science
courses that have been geared toward their career interests.
Beginning in the fall, all of the high school's students, expected to
be about 140 by then, will participate in the program.</TE>

<LD>Fueled by steady winds and thick brush, a wildfire continued to burn
out of control in the steep hillsides north of Ojai on Sunday,
charring more than 2,500 acres.</LD>
<LD>   By late afternoon, the fire had blackened a wide swath of rolling
hills and steep canyons on both sides of California 33 about 12 miles
north of Ojai in the Los Padres National Forest, said Kathy Good, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze was only 5% contained by late Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The cause of the blaze remains unknown, but it started at the Pine
Mountain Inn off the state highway about 3 p.m. Saturday, Good said.</TE>
<TE>   Early Sunday, officials said the fire had calmed down because of
cool, damp conditions overnight. But warm weather and gusting winds
gave the wildfire new strength.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the National Weather Service said the warm weather
and winds are expected to persist for the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ripping through and burning aggressively," Good said.</TE>
<TE>   Two campgrounds near the inn were evacuated Saturday, and
authorities asked campers and hikers in the popular Rose Valley
recreation area east of the blaze to voluntarily leave on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   More than 900 firefighters battled the fire on the ground and from
the air on Sunday, Good said. Five air tankers and three helicopters
were dropping water and retardant on the blaze, which burned through
an area untouched by fires in nearly 70 years, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Crews from the U.S. Forest Service, the Ventura County Fire
Department and the California Department of Forestry were called in
to fight the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures climbed into the mid 80s and a steady 20 mph breeze
fanned flames and spread embers.</TE>
<TE>   Embers burned half a dozen structures at the 160-acre Felt Ranch
on Sunday, Good said. The ranch has been the site of Native American
religious ceremonies in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters battled the fire after it ignited a garage but
intense flames, burning hazardous materials and the approaching front
of the wildfire forced them to turn back, Good said.</TE>
<TE>   "Firefighters had to pull out of the area because it was getting
so dangerous out there," Good said.</TE>

<HD>India Refuses to Talk Peace</HD>
<DH>Kashmir: Leaders head for regional summit with no plans to
meet despite war footing. Pakistan's Musharraf hopes Russia can bring
sides together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Amid fresh shelling along the India-Pakistan border and a steady
exodus of foreigners fearing a war, leaders of the two countries
departed for a regional security summit Sunday with little chance
that they would meet to talk peace.</LD>
<LD>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee told reporters that
"there is no such plan" for him to meet Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf at a summit of Central Asian leaders in Almaty, Kazakhstan,
that begins today.</LD>
<LD>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin plans to meet separately with
Vajpayee and Musharraf at the summit of 16 nations and hopes to
persuade them to talk. On a stopover in Tajikistan en route to the
summit Sunday, Musharraf expressed optimism that Russia, a
traditional ally of India, could help.</LD>
<TE>   "I think that President Putin can persuade India to join a
dialogue," Musharraf told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee, however, insists that the two sides have nothing to talk
about until Musharraf stops what India calls "cross-border terrorism"
in Kashmir. New Delhi says that the Pakistani military supports
guerrillas who cross into Indian-controlled areas of the disputed
Himalayan territory.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf says he already has cracked down on militants, but the
United States and other Western governments are demanding more action
to ease tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a year ago, the two leaders were smiling together at the
marble symbol of eternal love, the Taj Mahal. That meeting, however,
ended in disappointment, and now they are glaring at each other
against the imagined backdrop of a mushroom cloud.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee, a Hindu poet, and Musharraf, a Muslim paratrooper, never
had much chance of bonding at their three-day summit in the Indian
city of Agra last July. But at least they were talking for the first
time since 1999, when Musharraf, as head of the Pakistani army,
directed an incursion into Kargil, in Indian-held territory, that
brought the region to the brink of war.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy fighting left hundreds of soldiers and civilians dead.
At the time, Pakistan said the attack was carried out by guerrilla
fighters, not regular army troops. Kargil created bad feelings
between Vajpayee and Musharraf, who later seized power in a bloodless
coup.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Vajpayee defied hard-liners in his government and
agreed to Musharraf's request for talks at Agra without a set agenda.
Bureaucrats and diplomats normally use pre-negotiated limits on what
can be discussed as virtual leashes on leaders when they sit down to
deal with disputes as entrenched as Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, who was born in New Delhi but fled in 1947 to newly
created Pakistan with his family, visited his ancestral home before
the Agra summit. The open welcome he received raised hopes of a
breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Agra talks reported that they were going well,
without giving specifics. Rumors started that a landmark deal might
be in the works.</TE>
<TE>   As the final day of talks was set to start, Musharraf spoke to
Indian news editors at a breakfast session. His remarks were supposed
to be off the record, but an Indian satellite news network aired a
videotape. It showed Musharraf saying Pakistanis didn't trust India's
government and thought that it was stonewalling in the hope that the
Kashmir dispute would go away.</TE>
<TE>   With every tough line Musharraf delivered, the prospects of any
deal with Vajpayee disintegrated. Indian pundits quickly attacked
Vajpayee and his closest lieutenants for letting Musharraf win the
media battle, by making the Indian delegation seem aloof and
unwilling to compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee's sense of being burned at Agra by Musharraf, and the
Pakistani leader's more media-savvy handlers, are crucial to why the
Indian leader, and some of his key Cabinet members, are very
reluctant to trust Musharraf now, regardless of the risks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld will visit the region
this week and hopes to get Vajpayee and Musharraf to start talking
peace again. But he will have to find a way to crack the wall of
distrust cemented at Agra.</TE>
<TE>   As tensions rise again, the U.S., Britain, Canada, Israel and the
United Nations have all asked nonessential embassy staff and their
families to leave India and Pakistan. There has not been a panicked
rush out, but many are making departure plans.</TE>
<TE>   Several mid-ranking U.S. Embassy employees in New Delhi have
booked flights.</TE>
<TE>   Travel agents in New Delhi say they have been inundated with calls
from foreigners as well as locals scrambling to get reservations,
which were already hard to come by after airlines reduced their
schedules in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, local newspapers and magazines are full of doomsday
scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   The cover of the current issue of India Today, the country's
leading newsmagazine, features a photo montage of terrified people
fleeing a nuclear mushroom cloud rising behind the India Gate arch, a
New Delhi landmark.</TE>
<TE>   A graphic that runs over two inside pages shows many of the
capital's main government buildings crumbling and burning. It offers
this timeline of a nuclear blast:</TE>
<TE>   "5 secs: 200,000 people will die instantly at ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   "10 secs: Blast wave will destroy buildings in 10 km radius.</TE>
<TE>   "5 hrs: 300,000 people will be injured, half of them severely.</TE>
<TE>   "10 hours: India's retaliation will destroy all cities in
Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   Sandwiched between pages of the potential-war coverage is a
recruitment ad for the Indian army. "Be an army man," it says. "Be a
winner for life."</TE>
<TE>   Both India and Pakistan say nuclear war is unthinkable, but so
far, neither has been able to lead the way out of an escalating
confrontation that began in December when terrorists attacked India's
Parliament complex.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen people died in the assault, including the five gunmen,
whom India claims were sent by Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes repeated Sunday that his
country has a policy not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, but
he told an Asian security conference in Singapore that India won't
back down.</TE>
<TE>   "India will not be impulsive," Fernandes said. "Neither will we
waver in our determination, for the simple reason that what we have
been fighting and will continue to fight is the war against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "All we expect of the Musharraf regime is that it desist from
supporting terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Sunday, an Indian woman and a Pakistani paramilitary
official were reported killed by mortar fire in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   India also said eight civilians were injured when Pakistani troops
launched a mortar attack on Garkwal village, while Pakistan said four
soldiers were injured by Indian shelling of the nearby Charwa sector
of Sialkot district in Punjab province.</TE>
<TE>   With as many as 1 million troops facing each other along the
India-Pakistan border and the so-called Line of Control that divides
Kashmir, it will not be easy for either side to back down.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan wants foreign monitors deployed along the Line of Control
to verify that its military isn't assisting guerrillas crossing into
the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   But India has repeatedly ruled that idea out, in part because it
sees any attempt to "internationalize" the dispute as a Pakistani
effort to force third-party mediation. India has long insisted that
the Kashmir conflict can be resolved only between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage also plans to
visit India and Pakistan this week.</TE>
<TE>   When U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell made a trip to the
region in January, troops were quickly mobilizing along the border
and it looked like the situation would deteriorate. But Powell
persuaded Vajpayee to give Musharraf more time to meet demands, such
as the return of 20 suspects wanted for trial in India on terrorism
and other charges.</TE>
<TE>   Once Powell was back in Washington and the media spotlight shifted
to the Middle East crisis, however, Musharraf made it clear that he
had no intention of meeting India's demand for the suspects.</TE>

<DH>Philanthropy: An impoverished village gives 14 cows--a
prized possession--in sympathy for 9/11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ENOOSAEN, Kenya</DL>
<LD>In this remote corner of Africa, news about the Sept. 11 attacks on
New York and the Pentagon traveled slowly to the red-robed Masai
people who live here.</LD>
<LD>   And now, people in this tiny village have responded with an
outpouring of support to show the deep sorrow they felt for the
United States and victims of the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   They decided to give their most prized possessions, what Masai
regard as the highest expression of sympathy: cattle.</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, the Masai in this southwestern Kenya community
conducted a ceremony to express their condolences.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood producers could not have done better.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 people, many bedecked in elaborate beadwork jewelry,
gathered on the rolling East African savanna for the ceremony. Masai
women sang mournful songs. Young warriors, some carrying spears,
leapt into the air. And village elders presented to the United States
a herd of 14 cows.</TE>
<TE>   "They say Americans are wealthy, and indeed we are in many ways,"
said acting U.S. Ambassador to Kenya William Brencick, who gratefully
accepted the cattle. "But when we count the value of these cows and
... add the value of the great spirits that gave them, we can say
without doubt that you seem richer still."</TE>
<TE>   The gifts by Masai villagers here demonstrate how the events of
Sept. 11 have touched the remotest corners of the globe. Enoosaen is
a village about 20 miles from the Masai Mara Game Reserve, where
tourists from around the world flock to see lions, elephants and
other wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   But the people of Enoosaen are virtually invisible to these game
gawkers. The villagers are all Masai, arguably Africa's most
romanticized ethnic group--legendary for cattle herding, cattle
raiding, lion killing and drinking cow's blood.</TE>
<TE>   "A Masai warrior is a fine sight," wrote Isak Dinesen in "Out of
Africa." "Their style is not an assumed manner, nor an imitation of a
foreign perfection; it has grown from the inside and is an expression
of the race and its history."</TE>
<TE>   The nearly 300,000 Masai pastoralists who straddle the border
between Kenya and Tanzania shun modernity. Most of Enoosaen's mud
huts lack running water and electricity. There are no telephones, and
the only thing resembling a paved road is a 100-yard stretch of
tarmac 15 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the legend, many Masai these days wear Gap clothing and
Nike shoes. Some residents of Enoosaen carry cell phones and travel
90 minutes to go online at a town's Internet cafes.</TE>
<TE>   Enoosaen would not have rallied to show support for the United
States but for the world's fascination with the Masai. Several years
ago, an American journalist wrote about how villagers had sold cows
to raise $5,000 in school fees so a young warrior could realize his
dream of becoming a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The article caught the attention of University of Oregon
administrators, who offered Kimeli Naiyomah a scholarship. Naiyomah
later transferred to Stanford, where he is a premed student.</TE>
<TE>   On the Stanford campus, Naiyomah recounted how village elders had
raised him because he didn't know his biological father, and how he
planned to repay them by returning after graduation and building the
first hospital in Masailand.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Stanford President John Hennessy saluted Naiyomah in
his commencement address. Former President Clinton and his wife, Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), who were on campus for daughter
Chelsea's graduation, asked to meet the 25-year-old Naiyomah, posing
for pictures with him. Naiyomah, many said, could be the poster child
for Hillary Clinton's book, "It Takes a Village."</TE>
<TE>   Naiyomah left Stanford and returned to Enoosaen last month to
attend a weeklong rite-of-passage ceremony that made him a junior
elder in the village. One night, when the other young men gathered
under a tree to tell stories, Naiyomah recounted the horrors he
witnessed in September during a visit to New York. He told them how
"buildings that almost touched the clouds" tumbled down after
terrorists crashed two planes into the World Trade Center, how
desperate people jumped out of the burning buildings to their deaths
and how hundreds of rescuers died trying to save people.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was shocked," said William Oltetia, the 20-year-old
chief of Enoosaen's warriors. Oltetia said that he had not heard
about the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Others in Enoosaen said that they knew vaguely about Sept. 11 but
that Naiyomah's account brought the tragedy to life.</TE>
<TE>   Osama Bin Laden became a household word. People who are unpopular
in the village are now known simply as Osamas.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have anyone as cruel as him," said James Ngodia, 44.
"This man is a world enemy. If he comes to Masailand, we will surely
kill him with our spears and arrows."</TE>
<TE>   Naiyomah proposed to village elders that they do something to help
America.</TE>
<TE>   Within a week, 14 people pledged their cows. Those who donated
said they wanted to express their condolences but also show their
gratitude to the United States for taking care of Naiyomah and for
helping the village.</TE>
<TE>   Naiyomah has used money donated by American friends to build a
three-room schoolhouse and set up a water-purification system that
could help reduce illness.</TE>
<TE>   "When America is hurting, we want to share their pain," said
Ngodia, who donated two cows from his herd of 22. "Human lives are
the same whether it's in America or Masailand."</TE>
<TE>   Ngodia trades his cows for land, food and other goods to support
his three wives and 11 children. "A cow is like a bank account," he
said. "You treat it well and it gives you interest."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the 500 people, some of them from nearby villages,
gathered on a hillside here to present the cows to Brencick.</TE>
<TE>   Naiyomah used his rungu, or fighting stick, like a conductor's
baton, directing people to hold up signs that said, "September 11
tragedy," "We are touched by your loss" and "We give these cows to
help you."</TE>
<TE>   Evaline Kantai, 63, who sat under a guava tree observing the
ceremony, said the gift was so generous that it could have financed
the dowries for three sons. But she was happy that it was given to
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "The cows should be taken good care of and used the Masai way, to
get the milk and to get the meat," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Brencick later told the gathering that "it is not easy to take
these cows to New York across the sea."</TE>
<TE>   The cows instead will be sold and the proceeds used to buy
beadwork from the village, possibly an American flag that will hang
in a public place in New York, and other items.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has not been divided by this tragedy," Brencick said.
"You and we are helping to bring it together."</TE>

<HD>Northern Stars Are Aligned</HD>
<DH>On a brief stretch of Toronto pavement, Canada's Walk of
Fame highlights the number of celebrities down here who are from up
there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>The staid Princess of Wales Theater here may be a long way in spirit
and distance from Grauman's Chinese, but the sidewalk is familiar.
The walkway is freshly embedded with oversized signatures and gold
stars, and photographers jostle for closer shots as the actors and
musicians arrive to unveil this concrete proof of their celebrity.</LD>
<LD>   But the performers being honored here are all home-grown, and even
the paparazzi are impeccably polite.</LD>
<LD>   This is Canada's Walk of Fame, a 5-year-old venture that some
south of the border may view as a further step in Toronto's bid to
establish itself as Hollywood North. Organizers and honorees insist
it's just an overdue attempt to get this self-effacing society to
celebrate its own success stories.</LD>
<TE>   "Canada has never recognized its own," said Robin Duke, who was
inducted into the Walk of Fame last week with other cast members of
"SCTV," the low-budget satiric series that kick-started the careers
of an entire generation of Canadian comedians.</TE>
<TE>   But America has certainly recognized Canada's own: Duke's "SCTV"
colleagues--among them Martin Short, the late John Candy, Rick
Moranis, Andrea Martin and Eugene Levy--have collectively accounted
for much of mainstream U.S. comedy in recent decades. Like Duke and
her Toronto colleague Gilda Radner, many were first recruited to work
in the U.S. by "Saturday Night Live" producer Lorne Michaels. Also of
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto show biz world feels somewhat under assault these days
for its pursuit of what industry leaders in Los Angeles call
"runaway" productions. But last week's awards presentation
spotlighted what is seen here as a more powerful southbound
phenomenon: the runaway Canadian.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Canadian entertainment personalities honored with a
sidewalk star--the "SCTV" crew, director Arthur Hiller, game show
host Monty Hall, Grammy-collecting composer and record producer David
Foster--flew in from Los Angeles, where they have long lived and
worked. Then most flew right back.</TE>
<TE>   The 42-year-old Walk of Fame in Hollywood covers three miles of
sidewalk and boasts 2,197 stars, with one or two more added every
month. Immediately adjacent is the older, more exclusive forecourt of
Grauman's, with celebrity footprints and handprints dating to 1927
(not to mention Jimmy Durante's nose print and Groucho Marx's cigar
print).</TE>
<TE>   In Toronto, the nine gold stars unveiled last week raised the
grand total to 62; the "walk" is a brief mid-block stretch of
pavement in the downtown theater district.</TE>
<TE>   "This is flattery," Johnny Grant, the honorary Hollywood mayor and
longtime chairman of Hollywood's Walk of Fame committee, said of
Toronto's efforts. "I congratulate them and wish them the very best."</TE>
<TE>   Tradition, scale and candlepower aside, Canadians see another
salient difference between Toronto's star-studded sidewalk and the
Hollywood original. "You buy your stars down there," said Dave
Thomas, another "SCTV" veteran who went on to become a U.S. sitcom
regular. "Here, we get them for free."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Stars Carry Price Tag</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is right: In Hollywood, the honoree is billed a $15,000
"sponsorship fee," an expense typically absorbed by press agents, who
time the sidewalk unveilings to coincide with movie releases.</TE>
<TE>   In studious contrast, the Canadian Walk of Fame is a sober,
earnest enterprise. Organizers stress fairness and process: After
judges submit nominations, with strict Canadian-roots criteria, any
Canadian may cast a vote by e-mail. (The self-chosen electorate
remains quite small: Even this year's 55,000 votes would seem to
leave the door open to e-ballot stuffing.)</TE>
<TE>   And to elevate the overall tone of the affair, a few stars are
reserved for distinguished artists and writers, making the King
Street sidewalk perhaps the only common bond--nationality
aside--between Jim Carrey and Margaret Atwood.</TE>
<TE>   To give them an Oscar-like punch, the awards are presented at one
annual ceremony. And despite the disclaimers voiced here about the
Canadian aversion to self-promotion and show biz hoopla, the most
recent Walk of Fame gathering looked like any entertainment awards
gala, with a theater packed with tuxedos and beaded gowns and
speeches running from the heartfelt to the stagily rehearsed.</TE>
<TE>   "You got your red carpet there, you got limos," Norman Jewison,
the Toronto-born director of such films as "In the Heat of the Night"
and a proud Walk-of-Famer, joked approvingly to the capacity crowd of
2,000.</TE>
<TE>   But you know the event is Canadian when the smiling co-hosts are
both skaters (Kurt Browning, a figure skater, and Catriona LeMay
Doan, a record-breaking Olympian speedster). And when Rich Little
gets the crowd giggling with John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson
impressions. (If you're stumped, they're long-dead Canadian prime
ministers.) And instead of the King of Pop getting the audience's
feet tapping, it's the King of Polka (Walter Ostanek, a
Grammy-winning accordionist, who presented a posthumous award to Guy
Lombardo).</TE>
<TE>   The evening was also a tutorial in Canadian claims to mainstays of
"American" popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   There was Paul Anka, Ottawa teen idol turned Los Angeles music
impresario, belting out "My Way," the song he wrote for Frank Sinatra
and unwisely lent to Elvis Presley. And Hall, the Winnipeg boy who
turned deal-making and three closed doors into a 27-year TV game show
franchise (but is equally recognized here as the philanthropist who
built the children's wing of a Toronto hospital).</TE>
<TE>   The venerable U.S. custom of welcoming the new year with "Auld
Lang Syne"? The old Scottish ballad had been the signature song for
Lombardo's Royal Canadians, and when the band was featured on live
U.S. radio broadcasts of year-end festivities in the 1930s, "it
caught on," the gala crowd was informed.</TE>
<TE>   Canadians Among Hollywood's Hierarchy</TE>
<TE>   And, going further back, remember America's sweetheart? That would
be Canadian silent film star Mary Pickford, posthumous walk inductee.
Candidates for future post-mortem sidewalk stars include two of the
iconic creators of Hollywood itself, studio chiefs Louis B. Mayer
(who emigrated from Minsk to New Brunswick when he was 3) and Jack L.
Warner (born in London, Ontario).</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony's target audience is not oblivious Americans but
Canadians themselves, organizers stress. "I think they feel that
there are many Canadians that Canadians don't realize are Canadians,"
Hiller, the director of more than 30 movies and 300 television shows,
among them "Love Story" and "The Out-of-Towners," said before
unveiling his own sidewalk plaque.</TE>
<TE>   One example is Hiller himself, who, as a former head of both the
Directors Guild of America and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, is a longtime member of the Hollywood establishment. But he
started his career with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. half a
century ago and has quietly maintained ties to his native Alberta,
supporting a performing arts college that he says is emerging as
"Canada's Juilliard."</TE>
<TE>   And those wholesome, American-as-apple-pie actors Michael J. Fox
and William Shatner? Yes, them too. They've already gotten their
stars on the Canadian Walk of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Performers such as Hall say that to succeed in the United States,
they deliberately suppressed their Canadian accents and ended up
sounding prototypically American. And many successful Canadians'
comic identities were fashioned from U.S. fodder, from Short's "Wheel
of Fortune"-obsessed Ed Grimley to Dan Aykroyd's Elwood Blues.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers try to emphasize how Canadian their honorees really
are, expatriate success notwithstanding. Aykroyd, one learns in Walk
of Fame literature, studied criminology in Ottawa with the aim of
following in his Mountie grandfather's bootsteps. Hiller flew in
World War II with the Royal Canadian Air Force. Jewison broke into
the business as a researcher for "Hockey Tonight," a radio show that
is a Canadian broadcasting institution.</TE>
<TE>   But in the entertainment world, the work is in Los Angeles, not
Toronto, despite the fears of the Screen Actors Guild, and few if any
of the honorees living there expect to relocate north, they
acknowledged in their visit here.</TE>
<TE>   The no-shows for this year's ceremony, perhaps not coincidentally
the three with the greatest star wattage, are also all resident
Southern Californians: Aykroyd (schedule conflicts, organizers said);
Short (he abandoned the trip after his Air Canada flight was delayed
for hours at LAX); and Wayne Gretzky (he had promised not to miss his
son's baseball game, so asked his father to unveil his star instead).</TE>
<TE>   Leaning on America for Comedic Fodder</TE>
<TE>   Even Thomas, who with old friend Moranis created the earmuffed,
Molson-swilling MacKenzie brothers, perhaps the first Canadian comic
stereotypes ever to go global, says he's planning to apply for U.S.
citizenship, along with his Canadian-born oldest daughter.</TE>
<TE>   After 12 years in Malibu, he feels thoroughly at home there, he
says. And like his peers, most of his cultural source material has
long been of American origin, even when it was written and performed
here in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can say that our humor was distinctively
Canadian," he said, referring to his years at "SCTV." "We were
parodying television, and television was and is primarily American."</TE>

<HD>In the Taliban's Eyes, Bad News Was Good</HD>
<DH>Asia: Civilian deaths from U.S. bombing were exaggerated to
sway opinion.</DH>
<SE>THE UNTOLD WAR. Second of two parts. This is one in an occasional series
chronicling untold stories from the war in Afghanistan.</SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan--Early one morning last October, Mohammed Yunus
Mehrin was working the day shift on the city desk. He was a reporter
for the Taliban news service, hustling to the site of an overnight
American bombing raid.</LD>
<LD>   Arriving at the Darulaman Palace military garrison in southwest
Kabul, Mehrin watched bulldozers unearth battered bodies of Al Qaeda
and Taliban fighters. He recognized their black robes and turbans,
and saw their weapons in the debris of the flattened barracks. He
counted nearly a hundred corpses, he recalled. Among them appeared to
be Afghans and Pakistanis, Chechens and Arabs.</LD>
<LD>   Writing in Persian script in his notebook, he gathered details for
his daily report. The U.S. bombing campaign was reaching a climax in
the capital, and he knew the deaths of so many fighters was an
important story.</LD>
<TE>   The next day, when he heard his story on the Taliban's Voice of
Shariat radio, Mehrin was disgusted but hardly surprised. The radio
said that U.S. bombs had killed almost 100 civilians in a residential
area. It claimed that the attack was part of an American plan to sow
terror.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time truth had suffered in time of war.
Nor was it the first time the Taliban had rewritten a news report. In
fact, said Mehrin and three other former Taliban reporters, the
Taliban routinely altered their reports to inflate civilian
casualties and minimize military losses.</TE>
<TE>   If Al Qaeda commanders were killed in a safe house by an American
airstrike, they said, it was reported as Afghan families wiped out.
If two Afghan civilians were killed by an American bomb, it was
reported as a dozen dead. A destroyed Taliban antiaircraft site was
reported as a deadly attack on a maternity ward.</TE>
<TE>   "The Taliban put out some very big lies," Mehrin said at his bare
desk in a shabby newsroom now run by the American-backed interim
Afghan government. "We knew it. Ordinary people knew it. But what
could we do? All our bosses were Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   While most Western agencies characterized such reports as
unsubstantiated, they were often presented as fact in the Arab and
Muslim worlds. With the Taliban clinging to control of the capital,
there were few Western reporters to counter them.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban propaganda contributed to a portrait in many parts of the
world of an indiscriminate U.S. bombing campaign. On Oct. 31, just 24
days after the airstrikes began, the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan
claimed that they had already killed 1,500 to 1,600 civilians. The
envoy, Abdul Salam Zaeef, accused the United States of genocide.</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt that, at the very least, hundreds of civilians
died in U.S. airstrikes, and many more were wounded. Thousands of
Afghans lost their homes. Leftover cluster bombs and other unexploded
ordnance continue to maim and kill civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban's misinformation campaign put the Pentagon on the
defensive early in the war. It also helped fan resentment and outrage
among Muslims worldwide that persist months later.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports from the Taliban's Bakhtar News Agency were
inadvertently incorporated into tallies of civilian deaths by Western
news organizations, then included in lists published by academics. In
some lists, the same reported deaths were counted more than once.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes reports of the same incident cite different casualty
totals. A tally by University of New Hampshire economics professor
Marc W. Herold originally listed 25 civilians--not the nearly 100
reported by the Taliban--killed in the Darulaman attack, based on a
report by the Pakistan Observer, a newspaper in Islamabad. Herold
began looking into civilian casualties in October because he was not
satisfied with news reports, and his analyses are frequently cited
and debated by journalists and relief organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The Darulaman garrison was in a closed military area with no
civilian homes within two miles, making it highly unlikely that
civilians were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-five dead civilians?" said Mustafa Turgul, a military
officer now stationed next to the wrecked garrison. "That's
impossible. There were no civilians anywhere near here."</TE>
<TE>   Based on updated information, Herold says he now believes that the
25 dead were Al Qaeda fighters from Pakistan. He said the deaths are
no longer included in his overall civilian totals.</TE>
<TE>   Herold's analysis of news reports of civilian casualties
attributed to U.S. attacks found the number of reported deaths ranged
from 3,050 to 3,500. A Times review of more than 2,000 news stories
covering 194 incidents found a civilian death total of 1,067 to
1,201. The Times survey omitted Taliban reports that were not
substantiated by independent reporting, and 497 deaths not identified
as either civilian or military.</TE>
<TE>   Relief officials with the interim Afghan government say no formal
count has been completed, but they estimate the death total at 1,000
to 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 11, the fifth day of the American campaign, the Taliban's
Voice of Shariat radio said the "barbaric bombardment" of hospitals
and homes "shows the USA's seditious goal ... [to] murder the people
of Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Two false Taliban reports about hospital deaths were particularly
effective in portraying American bombing as callous.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 8, U.S. warplanes destroyed a Taliban antiaircraft and air
defense radar station atop a hill overlooking the Wazir Akbar Khan
hospital in central Kabul. Reports circulated through the city and
the Arab world that 13 to 19 women were killed in the hospital's
maternity ward when American bombs slammed into the facility.</TE>
<TE>   "Lies--all lies," said Ghulam Hussain, an emergency room nurse who
said he was on duty that night. "Not a single person in this hospital
was hurt. No rockets, no bombs, no missiles. Not even a window was
broken."</TE>
<TE>   According to Hussain and a fellow nurse, Said Ibrahim Hashimi, the
false report was the work of Mullah Ekhtiar Mohammed, a Taliban
official who was the hospital's director. He summoned Arab reporters
to his office and told them of the casualties, the nurses said.</TE>
<TE>   The story was reported as fact in the Arab world and the 13 to 19
deaths incorporated into Herold's original tally, which cited the
India Express newspaper. Herold said the deaths have since been
dropped from his total because of subsequent reporting. "I think the
real number is probably zero," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses and local residents say civilians were killed by a
U.S. bomb nearby on that day. As many as 10 civilians died in a home in
the Bebe Mahru district just below the radar site, they said.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 31 in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, Taliban
officials escorted selected journalists to what they said was a
clinic destroyed by an American airstrike. The journalists reported
that 10 to 15 civilians had died. The story received widespread
circulation in the Arab world via the Afghan Islamic Press, a
pro-Taliban agency.</TE>
<TE>   The site actually was an Al Qaeda military post and a small clinic
for Taliban wounded located next to a private home, according to an
Afghan security guard who said he witnessed the bombing. Interviewed
at the site, guard Abdul Salam said several Al Qaeda fighters and two
or three civilians from the private home were among those killed.</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Pushtoon, an official with the new Kandahar
government, said when asked about the incident: "A clinic? That was no
clinic. That place was full of Arabs," a reference to foreign Al Qaeda
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Qara Big Izid Yar, a Taliban foe who is now president of the
Afghan Red Crescent aid agency, was in Germany and Denmark during
most of the bombing campaign. He said news reports there led him to
believe that civilian deaths were in the many thousands.</TE>
<TE>   "The Taliban propaganda created a huge distortion in the outside
world, especially early in the war," Yar said. "Civilians were
killed, of course, but not nearly as many as the Taliban said, or in
the way they said."</TE>
<TE>   Yar said he asked his fieldworkers across Afghanistan to file
reports on civilian deaths caused by American strikes, as documented
by local councils. He said he believes that the final death toll will
be slightly more than 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans were careful and their bombs were very accurate,"
Yar said. "They checked to see for sure that they were targeting
Taliban or Al Qaeda bases or convoys. The people who died--it was
accidental, not deliberate."</TE>
<TE>   False claims by Afghan civilians seeking compensation also have
contributed to exaggerated death tolls. The claims were incorporated
into informal or anecdotal accounts by Western relief agencies and
nongovernmental organizations that work closely with the Red Crescent
and the Afghan Ministry of Martyrs. The relief agencies and NGOs were
used as sources for early news accounts, particularly in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   The Ministry of Martyrs and the Disabled pays up to $6.50 to
survivors of civilians killed in wars. Survivors also receive rations
of wheat, cooking oil, tea, sugar, soap and tarps.</TE>
<TE>   Baz Mohammed Zormati, the agency's deputy minister, said his staff
tries to verify applications, but he conceded that some false claims
have slipped through. Many Afghans believe that claiming deaths from
American airstrikes could entitle them to generous U.S. payments.
Zormati estimated that perhaps 2,000 civilians have been killed by U.S.
bombings, although he said his ministry lacks the resources for an
accurate count.</TE>
<TE>   Yar said, "These are very poor people, and this is a lot of money
for them, so sometimes they will say anything to get it."</TE>
<TE>   Mehrin and his fellow reporters said they went to bombing sites to
gather fresh firsthand evidence. They said they turned in accurate
reports to their Taliban editors, who rewrote them.</TE>
<TE>   Reporter Mohammed Ismail Qanay dug into a file room at the
Ministry of Information and Culture and emerged with a dogeared
folder labeled Archive File 67. Inside was the neatly typed Taliban
report of the Darulaman garrison bombing describing nearly 100 dead
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bosses called this the war against the Christian crusaders,"
Qanay said. "They thought that if the people were told that the
Americans were deliberately bombing civilians, they would rise up and
kill the invaders."</TE>
<TE>   Wasy, a spokesman for the interim government, who goes by one
name, said previous Afghan governments also exaggerated civilian
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "If you added them all up, maybe they'd exceed the population of
Afghanistan," Wasy said. "The Taliban were following this tradition,
trying to prove the American 'smart' bombs weren't so smart and the
Americans wanted to terrorize the population."</TE>
<TE>   Zabiullah Alam, another former Taliban reporter, said journalists
joked among themselves about the alchemy their superiors performed
with numbers. "The standard rule was: If five civilians were killed,
15 more would 'die' on the radio report, for a total of 20," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the reporters had insisted on filing accurate stories, Alam
said, "We'd have been ... " and he slashed his finger across his
throat.</TE>
<TE>   With Western reporters massed in Pakistan last fall, trying to get
into Afghanistan, United Nations officials in Islamabad also provided
reports on civilian casualties. Stephanie Bunker, a U.N. spokeswoman,
said the U.N. reported only casualties confirmed by witnesses, such
as U.N. Afghan staffers or officials with nongovernmental
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Bunker said false Taliban reports were picked up by some news
agencies and repeated by independent computer analyses, inflating the
total deaths reported. "It wasn't multiple sources. It was the same
source--Bakhtar--reported over and over again," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, the reporters from the Taliban news agency
dutifully rode their bicycles to the Information Ministry at dawn
every day, then piled into rattletrap government cars to race to the
latest bombing site.</TE>
<TE>   Qanay recalled visiting a Taliban military fuel depot in the north
Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Abad after it was destroyed by U.S.
warplanes Oct. 20. He said he found no evidence that anyone had been
killed, either fighters or civilians.</TE>
<TE>   But the next day, he said, the Taliban's Voice of Shariat radio
reported 10 civilians killed.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later, Qanay said, he visited a home attacked by American
planes in the northwest Kabul neighborhood of Khair Khana. Residents
told him that five pickup trucks with Taliban fighters had been
parked outside the house. Three vehicles were destroyed by a U.S.
warplane, killing several Taliban fighters. The other two vehicles
escaped. Five civilians in the house were killed, Qanay said.</TE>
<TE>   His Taliban bosses deleted the vehicles and fighters from his
report, he said, and issued a bulletin saying 15 civilians had been
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Qanay has been promoted to bureau chief for the Ministry of
Information and Culture, now run by the interim government.</TE>
<TE>   Gone from the newsroom are the sayings of the Taliban leader,
Mullah Mohammed Omar. The office now features a portrait of the
assassinated Northern Alliance commander, Ahmed Shah Masoud.</TE>
<TE>   Qanay keeps a photo of himself from his days as a reluctant
co-conspirator in the Taliban's propaganda factory, when he was
required to wear the tunic and pantaloons, a turban and a flowing
beard. Qanay is now cleanshaven, bare-headed and wears a gray
pinstripe suit.</TE>
<TE>   He still covers the war and its aftermath. His dispatches are
edited, he said, but they are no longer distorted or entirely
rewritten.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is our boss, and the government still decides what
the news is," Qanay said, seated in the newsroom. "Our only orders
are to try to tell the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Richard O'Reilly and researchers Kevin
Lew-Hailer and John Jackson contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Britain Throws Party Fit for Queen</HD>
<DH>Monarchy: Elizabeth II celebrates her 50 years on the
throne. The occasion reprises the debate on the relevance of the
Windsors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>If the British monarchy were a publicly traded corporation--and who's
to say there won't one day be an IPO of Windsor Ltd.--the stock would
now be climbing as high as the new Typhoon fighter jet that will
stage a dramatic flyover Tuesday to cap the four-day Golden Jubilee
weekend celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's 50 years on the throne.</LD>
<LD>   As for such a royal stock's prospects for years to come, what
wizard can predict that? Next to soccer, Britain's second-favorite
sport is handicapping the monarchy's long run, and Britons use
milestones such as this Jubilee for national navel-gazing: Do we
still want the monarchy? And if we do, what kind of people does that
make us?</LD>
<LD>   The woman at the center of all this is England's 42nd sovereign in
936 years, and only the fifth to spend half a century on the throne.
She is a 76-year-old grandmother who has let her hair go white
(actually quite becoming with a diamond tiara), and has let her
children go to divorce court. Like Elizabeth I, this Elizabeth was 25
years old when she became queen. It happened at some unknown moment
in February 1952, as she was watching wild game from a Kenyan
treetop, and as her father, King George VI, died in his sleep.</LD>
<TE>   The four-day holiday marking her half-century reign--the "Greatest
Party Weekend in History," one tabloid promised--began in weather as
warm and golden as melted butter. The promising whiff of regimental
horse doo--a guaranteed harbinger of a full-on royal event--was
briefly accompanied by the scent of smoke from a small fire at
Buckingham Palace on Sunday. The blaze interrupted rehearsals for
tonight's pop concert but was soon extinguished. Damage was said to
be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's "Party at the Palace" concert, even more than Saturday's
classical concert in the palace gardens, signals a monarchy willing
to take its lumps and make changes: 24,000 ordinary Britons out of 2
million who wanted tickets were invited to the two concerts. They
didn't have to be good or accomplished, just lucky.</TE>
<TE>   In the royal box for Saturday's concert were a conservative
politician and--stop the presses--Prince Charles' girlfriend, Camilla
Parker Bowles. In the royal box tonight to hear Paul McCartney, Eric
Clapton and Ozzy Osbourne will be liberal Prime Minister Tony Blair
and those heartthrob teenage brothers, Princes William and Harry.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday will begin with a thanksgiving service in St. Paul's
Cathedral, and while the queen will go there in the lumbering gilded
state coach, she will depart in her most expensive jubilee gift,
courtesy of Bentley: a multimillion-dollar automobile with a
bulletproof body and a satellite phone hotline.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday will also show the face of New Britain, a parade and
show of 20,000 performers, among them a Hells Angel biker, 5,000
gospel choir voices, African and Caribbean performers from the
remnants of the Commonwealth so dear to the queen's heart, and a
children's troupe from London's Chicken Shed Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lacey stands atop the ladder of royal writers as the queen
stands atop the monarchy. His new book is called "Royal: Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II," and he says the monarchy has been able to adapt
and flourish since King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 after civil
war.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver Cromwell, who took over the nation as lord protector, had
himself buried with crowns on his coffin and, kinglike, tried to name
his son as his successor. The British preferred the real thing, thank
you, and in 1660 happily welcomed King Charles II back to his
father's realm.</TE>
<TE>   The new Britain and its old monarch, says Lacey, are now a match:</TE>
<TE>   "One of the functions of a monarchy in a changing world is to be a
beacon of unchanging values. At the same time, it is constantly
running for reelection, it constantly has to prove its relevance."</TE>
<TE>   The pop concert, he said, was "a stroke of genius." Such music, he
said, has "come to symbolize" the new, inventive Britain.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Jubilee planning started tentatively; the palace as
well as critics spent months trying to lower expectations and
fretting over costs--critics because they're critics, and the palace
so that if the celebration failed, and especially if it failed
expensively, it wouldn't be compared poorly to the Silver Jubilee of
1977.</TE>
<TE>   But in February, the queen's sister, Princess Margaret, died, and
in late March, the 101-year-old Queen Mother did too. Sympathy rose,
gradually joined by the prospect of a good time, and the Golden
Jubilee was on.</TE>
<TE>   The Windsors of 2002 are not the family of 1977. They have been
changed by years of embarrassments so familiar they hardly bear
repeating, which doesn't stop the press from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is this jubilee the national street party of 25 years ago, and
although some of the old imperial touches are still here--the silver
and scarlet, the plumes and the pipes--it is not remotely like Queen
Victoria's Diamond Jubilee of 1897, which showed off with a naval
review of ships extending 25 miles. Mark Twain wrote that Victoria's
jubilee procession was "a spectacle for the camera, not the pen," but
added that "one can enjoy a rainbow without necessarily forgetting
the force that made it."</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Britons have breakfasted on stories about an
anti-jubilee guillotine party as well as jubilee festivities in a
nudist colony and in prisons. They've been told how much the value of
their houses has risen since Elizabeth became queen ($8 a day) and
how much the divorce rate has gone up since her Silver Jubilee (27%,
slightly higher in her own family).</TE>
<TE>   They've also been tempted by a glut of jubilee goods, churned out
warily. Merchants wondered: Would Americans travel after Sept. 11?
Would Britons take the four days and skedaddle off to Sardinia?</TE>
<TE>   But jubilee stuff abounds. Even second-hand shops hung red, white
and blue remnants in the windows. Mohammed Fayed, the owner of
Harrods department store--who in court once accused the queen's
husband, Prince Philip, of masterminding the crash that killed
Fayed's son and Princess Diana--was evidently not reluctant to make a
pile off the jubilee. Before the big weekend, Harrods had sold out of
all things jubilee but a few teapots.</TE>
<TE>   And now the High Street shops have genteel competition. Maybe the
queen's father knew better than he realized when he called the royal
family "the firm."</TE>
<TE>   The monarchy has trademarked the names of the queen's privately
owned homes, Sandringham and Balmoral. She has sent the contents of
her closets on tour and has exhibited her priceless stamp collection.
She has taken pictures off the walls and out of archives to
exhibit--some for charity, some toward the upkeep of the treasures.
At a joint session of Parliament, the lord chancellor got a laugh
when he praised the palace for setting up a Web site and he read out
the address like anyone with something to promote. It is often said
that the queen hates gimmicks and stunts and spin doctors--but shrewd
business is something else altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Most significantly, the Windsor chief executive made it clear in a
speech in April that this firm has no mandatory retirement age. She
was spiritually anointed to the job, not just promoted. If she were
to depart this world tonight, her son and heir, Charles, would have
to live until 103 to see his own Golden Jubilee.</TE>
<TE>   The conundrum is that Elizabeth Windsor would not have chosen this
life for herself. She has said she'd choose to live in the country
with dogs and horses--but she sticks dutifully to it, and will
evidently do so to her last breath. It is that, says Lacey, the
figure embodying a yearning for community and filling the
imagination, that has kept crown and country together.</TE>

<HD>Iraq's Wary Kurds Wonder What Washington Has in Mind</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Key opposition group sees both oppor- tunity and
danger in any bid to topple Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>IRBIL, Iraq</DL>
<LD>Long before terrorist-piloted passenger jets slammed into the Word
Trade Center, Sept. 11 was a tragic watershed for Iraq's rebellious
Kurds.</LD>
<LD>   On the same day in 1961, Iraqi air force jets began raining bombs
across northern Iraq, flattening thousands of Kurdish villages and
killing many more Iraqi Kurds in a campaign of brutal repression that
lasted with few pauses until President Saddam Hussein's defeat in the
1991 Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   Today, amid speculation that America's post-Sept. 11 war on
terrorism will target Hussein next, Iraqi Kurdish leaders see both
opportunities and dangers for their people.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going through a crucial period in our history," said
Massoud Barzani, leader of the stronger of the two rival Kurdish
factions that have controlled northern Iraq for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   With 50,000 men in arms and control of an area roughly 16,000
square miles, the Iraqi Kurds are the strongest opposition group in
the country. U.S. officials acknowledge that the group would be
likely to play a substantial role in any effort to overthrow
Hussein's regime. Kurdish leaders say their support would come at a
price.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not drag our people into any operation that does not
guarantee their rights as equal citizens within a federally
administered, democratic Iraq," Barzani said in a recent interview at
his sprawling, hilltop headquarters overlooking this
Kurdish-controlled city.</TE>
<TE>   Barzani had just returned from secret talks with U.S. officials in
Germany, where he was joined by his archrival, Kurdish warlord Jalal
Talabani, who controls the eastern section of the Kurdish enclave, to
discuss the Kurds' potential role.</TE>
<TE>   Barzani declined to give details of the talks. Faced with
traditionally hostile neighbors--Turkey, Syria and Iran, all of which
have restive Kurdish minorities--and with Hussein's tanks positioned
at strategic points around the Kurdish enclave, Barzani would say
only that he and about 3.6 million Kurds remain vulnerable and are
wary of U.S. intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Recent reports from Washington claiming that the Bush
administration has shelved plans to overthrow the Iraqi leader have
only served to deepen the Kurds' misgivings. "We were being served
attack scenarios for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and now this," said
Sami Abdurrahman, a senior Barzani aide. "It is not clear what the
U.S. wants."</TE>
<TE>   Memories of the time that Washington encouraged them to rise up
against Hussein at the end of the Gulf War, and the United States'
failure to intervene when the Iraqi leader's remaining forces
retaliated, haunt many Kurds.</TE>
<TE>   Fleeing Iraqi troops, more than 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds massed
along the bitterly cold mountains separating Iraq from Turkey and
Iran. Television images of their plight prompted an international
outcry. Soon after, the U.S. and allies Britain and France declared a
"no-fly" zone over the Kurdish north.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the Gulf War, the Kurds stuck their heads above the
parapet and got it shot off," said a Western diplomat who watches the
Kurds closely and spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Few Iraqi Kurds conceal their bitterness over the fact that they
have come to the world's attention again "only because the Americans
need us," as Jano Rojbeiani, a Kurdish American film director, put
it.</TE>
<TE>   Rojbeiani was in Irbil to promote his new film about the effects
of a 1988 chemical attack by Iraqi forces against Kurdish civilians
in the town of Halabjah, which killed more than 4,000 people. At the
time, he said, "Saddam was not a demon but an American ally against
Iran. Nobody cared about the Kurds then."</TE>
<TE>   Yet most Iraqi Kurds readily acknowledge that they owe their
unprecedented security of the last decade to allied air protection.
Under that shield, and with their share of funds from the United
Nations' Iraqi oil-for-food program, the Kurds have been steadily
rebuilding their war-shattered region.</TE>
<TE>   They have freedoms unseen elsewhere across Middle Eastern
dictatorships, albeit under firm, one-party rule. Ethnic and
religious minorities can set up their own parties, radio and
television channels, and publish newspapers and run schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody forces me to do military service here. I'm all in favor of
Kurdish independence," said Hasan Krani Fettah, a 19-year-old
English-language student at the local university, airing a sentiment
that is shared by many Iraqi Kurds but dismissed as unrealistic by
their leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdish leaders have been expanding contacts with the majority
Shiite and Sunni Iraqi opposition groups in a bid to present a united
front in their talks with the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from these groups are set to travel to Washington
this month for meetings at which Kurdish leaders say they will
discuss possible blueprints for a future Iraqi regime.</TE>
<TE>   The administration, however, is unlikely to support Kurdish
demands for an independent government loosely linked with Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we do support regime change, but the Kurds need to work out
details with their fellow Iraqis," said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Another reason is that Turkey, a strategic
U.S. ally that has long fought a Kurdish insurgency, has threatened
to intervene militarily should the Iraqi Kurds show any signs of
breaking away from Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British warplanes enforcing the Kurdish no-fly zone take
off from the Incirlik base in southern Turkey. Allied aircraft used
Incirlik as a launching pad during bombing raids against Iraqi
targets during the Gulf War. The United States sees Turkey's
cooperation as vital to any military effort to topple Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Nechirvan Barzani, who is in charge of running the slice of Iraqi
Kurdistan controlled by his uncle Massoud Barzani, said: "The longer
the Americans are talking about overthrowing Saddam and not doing it,
the greater the likelihood of Saddam attacking us Kurds first. That
is the greatest risk of all."</TE>

<DH>Mexico: Police take 16 into custody from village near site
where 26 were slain in a land dispute.</DH>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Authorities said Sunday that they had arrested 16 suspects in the
Friday night massacre of 26 peasants, victims of a bitter land
dispute between rival villages in mountainous southern Oaxaca state.</LD>
<LD>   The slain, all men from the municipality of Santiago Xochiltepec,
were killed in an ambush as they returned home from their logging and
sawmill jobs in the Sierra Sur mountains about 300 miles southeast of
Mexico City.</LD>
<LD>   Six survivors gave investigators descriptions that led to the
arrests.</LD>
<TE>   The Oaxaca state attorney general's office said the 16 suspects
were arrested in Santo Domingo de Teojomulco. In March, that village
lost a decision before a federal agrarian reform tribunal to Santiago
Xochiltepec, a largely Zapotec indigenous community with about 1,000
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "This attack was an act of vengeance of one community toward
another," the attorney general's office said in a statement. "This
problem has its origin in the extreme poverty and marginalization in
which hundreds of Oaxaca communities live."</TE>
<TE>   The tribunal gave Santiago Xochiltepec improved rights to a
disputed 20,000-acre spread of valuable timberland and cornfields,
said Eric Heras of the attorney general's office in the capital city,
which is also called Oaxaca.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after the March decision, residents of Santiago
Xochiltepec were reportedly fired on by members of the losing
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "The arguments are usually over boundary lines. They can be hard
to determine in the mountains," Heras said.</TE>
<TE>   Various indigenous communities have been feuding over land in the
region for centuries. More than 200 state and federal agents were
sent to investigate Friday's killings.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the arrests, police and army units seized 24
firearms, including AK-47s and shotguns, and hundreds of rounds of
ammunition. The suspects were all jailed in the state capital.
Tension remained high in the area, and army units as well as federal
and state police continued to patrol the zone.</TE>
<TE>   The victims were shot as they packed into the back of a truck.
They had just been paid at their jobs at sawmills in San Pedro el
Alto and were on their way home for the weekend when shooting erupted
in a settlement called Agua Fria.</TE>
<TE>   The killers fired down on the truck from an adjoining ridge after
the driver, Alberto Antonio Perez, had been stopped and allowed to
flee. The killers then stripped the bodies of cash and valuables.</TE>
<TE>   Perez is cooperating in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   There have been several bloody clashes in mountain areas over
rights to forests, which provide a coveted source of income to the
indigenous poor.</TE>
<TE>   Land disputes are common throughout Mexico, and literally
thousands of cases remain open before various federal tribunals.</TE>

<HD>Police Dropping 'Nonlethal' Beanbags as Too Dangerous</HD>
<DH>Safety: The devices kill and maim, officers say. Huntington
Beach is suing a manufacturer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a decade after small, square beanbags fired from shotguns
emerged as the "nonlethal" ammunition of choice, police departments
nationwide are abandoning them after finding that they can be
dangerously inaccurate and deadlier than manufacturers claimed.</LD>
<LD>   The devices, the size of tea bags and made of tough fabric filled
with lead shot, are supposed to bounce off their targets, allowing
police officers to stop a potentially dangerous person without
causing major injuries. But officials cite examples of beanbags
penetrating deep into the body, causing serious internal injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Emergency room doctors in Los Angeles last year warned hospitals
across the country about the dangers of police beanbags. And Los
Angeles police, after extensive tests prompted by the death of a
mentally ill man hit by a bag, concluded that the rounds frequently
failed to work as designed.</LD>
<TE>   In what is shaping up as a legal test case for nonlethal weapons,
Huntington Beach is suing the country's largest beanbag manufacturer,
claiming that the company failed to properly warn police about the
dangers of the rounds. The suit stems from an incident in which
officers nearly killed a suspect with beanbags that ripped deep into
the man's chest.</TE>
<TE>   The problems underscore the continued difficulty police agencies
face in finding weapons that can stop people without killing them.</TE>
<TE>   Beanbags and plastic bullets have killed 12 people in the United
States and Canada, according to surveys by law enforcement weapons
experts who track cases as far back as the 1970s. Dozens more people
have suffered injuries ranging from ruptured eyeballs and damaged
spleens to broken bones.</TE>
<TE>   Federal testing and industry standards exist for police bullets,
but no standards exist in the world of nonlethal weapons. A project
launched by the federal government 10 years ago to develop safety
standards has yet to yield any.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some [weapons] out there that are clearly not as
less-than-lethal as they claim," said David Boyd, a director with the
National Institute of Justice, a branch of the U.S. Department of
Justice. "What we lack right now is an objective way of telling which
ones they are."</TE>
<TE>   Beanbag manufacturers defend the accuracy and safety record of
their products, saying the ammunitions should only bruise or graze a
target when police officers use them correctly. They maintain that
many of the deaths and severe injuries have been caused when officers
fire from too close or aim for sensitive areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Beanbags, if used appropriately, are very effective," said
Michael Keith, president of MK Ballistic Systems. "There are probably
several thousand lives in this country that have been saved as a
result of the beanbags."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Sid Heal isn't used to missing a target, but the Los Angeles
County sheriff's marksman watched helplessly one recent morning as he
fired a shotgun filled with beanbags.</TE>
<TE>   The first beanbag fell well short of its mark. A second missed the
center of the target by a foot.</TE>
<TE>   "There you go," he said. "Nobody can tell what they'll do. They're
like a leaf in the wind."</TE>
<TE>   Heal has squirted sticky foam at Marines in Somalia and zapped
sheriff's deputies with electric Tasers at home. He has blasted stun
grenades into buildings and pumped gelatin blocks full of plastic
bullets.</TE>
<TE>   As police experiment with ways to knock people down without
hurting them, arms makers have flooded the market with weapons they
say are less likely to be lethal. Heal has tried virtually all of
them.</TE>
<TE>   At the range, he strode up to a row of paper targets hanging 75
feet away. Inspecting his target, he pointed to narrow holes that
beanbags had torn in the paper, a sign that the rounds had not worked
properly.</TE>
<TE>   Beanbags are designed to unfurl when fired, slapping a suspect
with their open face. But Heal and other ballistics experts have
discovered that the rounds often strike on an edge or while still
curled up, turning them into sometimes deadly projectiles.</TE>
<TE>   'Fail Catastrophically'</TE>
<TE>   "When they fail, they fail catastrophically," Heal said. "We're in
the blunderbuss age of less-lethal weapons."</TE>
<TE>   The concern over safety is one reason the square beanbags are
falling out of favor. Last year, Defense Technologies, the country's
largest maker of beanbags, sold them to 288 agencies, down from 604
the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few years ago, beanbags were the most popular of all
nonlethal ammunition, winning praise from civil rights advocates as a
humane way of scattering unruly crowds and restraining violent or
suicidal suspects.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and other big cities, police credited beanbags with
helping reduce officer-involved shootings by 50% in the last five
years. LAPD officers used beanbags 68 times last year, according to
police reports.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, doctors have had a very
different experience.</TE>
<TE>   On the 13th floor, behind clanging steel doors and armed guards,
lies a bleak ward devoted to treating jail inmates and those injured
while being arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, hospital officials decided to track beanbag
injuries. They assigned the task to Dr. Dirk de Brito, an intense
35-year-old intern. Over the next four years, he reviewed 40 injuries
treated at County-USC stemming from incidents involving the LAPD or
Sheriff's Department. He discovered that beanbags were capable of
breaking bones, bruising internal organs and ripping through skin.</TE>
<TE>   "Because this is a new weapon, a substantial part of the human
testing of this has been on the streets of L.A.," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One evening, two LAPD officers escorted a 37-year-old inmate into
the jail ward. They told De Brito that they shot the man when he ran
at them with a machete. They said they fired beanbags to avoid
hurting him.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, nothing looked seriously wrong. But De Brito
decided to check the man's forearm. The impact of a beanbag, he
found, had crushed the arm so severely that blood couldn't flow.
Blood pressure inside the limb was growing dangerously high. De Brito
grabbed a surgeon, who sliced open the inmate's arm to relieve the
pressure and save his limb.</TE>
<TE>   With some injuries, officers admitted that they had shot beanbags
just a few feet from a suspect, far closer than manufacturers
recommend, says the most comprehensive medical report yet on beanbag
injuries, co-written last fall by De Brito. In other cases, the
officers said they fired from a safe distance.</TE>
<TE>   The report cites the man who needed 100 pieces of lead shot
removed from his chest. The teenager who had a beanbag smash into his
skull and lodge behind his eye. The 32-year-old man struck so hard
that his spleen ruptured.</TE>
<TE>   Lives Saved</TE>
<TE>   "I know these saved lives," De Brito said, "but I wish the
officers had something better."</TE>
<TE>   In September 1999, LAPD officers in Van Nuys tried to calm a
29-year-old man, Daniel Antonio Hernandez, who was yelling in the
street and talking incoherently. According to the officers, Hernandez
picked up a metal stake and rushed at them. One of the officers fired
a beanbag shotgun. One round penetrated Hernandez's jaw. Another
struck a medallion that hung from his neck and pierced his chest,
tearing into a lung and killing him.</TE>
<TE>   The officers said the shots were fired from a relatively safe
distance. Supervisors were skeptical at first. Doreen Hudson, a
veteran LAPD criminalist, helped launch tests to see if the officers
could be telling the truth.</TE>
<TE>   During months of testing, researchers said, the beanbags regularly
struck targets while curled up or on their edge. In one set of tests,
fewer than 10% of the rounds opened in flight.</TE>
<TE>   "It will hit on its edge and cut you like a knife," Hudson said.
"Nobody wants to pull the trigger and not know what the outcome is
going to be."</TE>
<TE>   New Beanbag Style</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, hundreds of police agencies have changed to
a new type of beanbag that resembles a sock filled with lead shot--a
move that the LAPD is considering.</TE>
<TE>   The sock-style rounds lack the sharp edges of square bags, and
ballistics experts say they are much less likely to cause serious
injuries. But they have killed three people in the last two years,
including a 48-year-old Long Beach woman who was hit so hard that the
impact tore the wall of her heart.</TE>
<TE>   Most beanbag manufacturers market the sock-style weapons as more
accurate but maintain that the square rounds remain a safe option.</TE>
<TE>   At Defense Technologies' parent company, Armor Holdings Inc.,
based in Florida, officials said they are "skeptical of the claim"
that tests show the square bags to be unsafe. The company, they said,
conducted extensive tests to ensure that the product was safe before
selling it.</TE>
<TE>   The bags, they added, have been shot at people hundreds of times
without problems. And when fired at safe distances, they have
inflicted little more than a welt or large bruise, said Steve
Croskrey, president and chief executive of Armor's product division.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach police say otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing the city contend that the company's
beanbags nearly killed James Marvin Davis when officers tried to take
him into custody.</TE>
<TE>   The January 1999 incident began with a 911 call by Davis' fiancee,
who complained that he was drunk and acting abusive. Officers ordered
Davis out of his house. Davis, then 56, refused and stood in his
doorway screaming.</TE>
<TE>   Believing that he had a gun, an officer grabbed a beanbag shotgun
and opened fire. "I felt thump, thump, thump to my chest. It felt
like I was being punched," Davis recalled. "I had blood running down
my arms.... I remember shouting, 'Look what you've done to me!'"</TE>
<TE>   Three rounds bored through his chest, breaking two ribs and
severing an artery. The bags had to be removed by surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   While Davis recovered, police investigated the shooting. Police
reports of the shooting scene suggest that the beanbags were fired
from about 30 feet--a range that company literature deemed safe.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is suing the department, which in turn has sued the
manufacturer. The department alleges that the company failed to warn
police adequately about the dangers of the bags. The company denies
any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Testing Ammunition</TE>
<TE>   In the largest test of nonlethal weapons to date, researchers from
Pennsylvania State University, who worked with the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, examined 100 types of rubber, wood and foam
bullets, along with beanbags and other ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter of the rounds didn't hit a man-sized target when fired
from 75 feet. Many also failed quality control tests. When a first
shot would leave the gun barrel too slowly, a second round would
explode from the muzzle at deadly speed.</TE>
<TE>   "The disparity ranged from completely ineffective to tragic," said
Heal, the sheriff's captain.</TE>
<TE>   Many in law enforcement believe that these problems could have
been prevented had the federal government tested the beanbags the
same way it evaluates other types of ammunition and equipment used by
law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   At the National Institute of Justice, scientists blame funding
woes for their slow progress on safety evaluations. This year, $2.5
million has been allocated to speed up work, they say.</TE>

<HD>A Gusher of Verse Erupts in Bakersfield</HD>
<DH>Arts: Thanks largely to a persistent advocate in town, big
names in poetry keep dropping by.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>BAKERSFIELD -- This is a town with a river that runs dry through its
heart. The suburbs sprawl in every direction without rhyme. No city
west of the Mississippi takes up more land (116 square miles) for
fewer people (254,000).</LD>
<LD>   But Bakersfield does have a soul, and it's not what you think. It
reaches past the oil and farm fields. It rises above the dusty twang
of Buck Owens and his Buckaroos.</LD>
<LD>   This town, of all things, has become one hot ticket on the
American poetry circuit. It's not quite what Ashland, Ore., is to
Shakespeare, but some of the country's most respected poets have been
making the trek down Highway 99 to read their stuff to fans in
Bakersfield. It happened again Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The list includes Pulitzer Prize winner Philip Levine and poets
such as Frank Bidart, Southern Californian B.H. Fairchild, Ted Kooser
and Peter Everwine, who have won other top awards or been finalists
for the Pulitzer or National Book Award. Bidart, for one, didn't
quite know what to make of a giant billboard that had been rented
along a main drag to promote his reading a few years back.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield would hardly seem to lend itself to such distinction.
This is, after all, a place where authors have come to find fodder,
not fans.</TE>
<TE>   From John Steinbeck to Carrie McWilliams to native son Gerald
Haslam, writers have discovered their prose and poem songs in the
dirt of Kern County and then high-tailed it out of town. When "The
Grapes of Wrath" came out in 1939 depicting the mythical Joads and
their cruel life here, Steinbeck was celebrating a safe distance away
while copies of his book were burned on the front steps of the local
library.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield's sudden embrace of verse has little to do with civic
redemption, though. It is mostly the hard fight of one stubborn lady,
a retired schoolteacher and local poet named Lee McCarthy, who calls
herself "the meanest, most persistent woman in Kern County."</TE>
<TE>   She has twisted literary arms and puffed up literary egos and put
a few civic noses out of joint to lure fine poets to town. When the
local arts council balked at her vision of a reading series this
year, she dug into her own meager pockets to not only fund the series
but make sure that residents--folks who may have never heard a poet
read--showed up in force.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a podunk town any more than any other town," McCarthy
said. "And if you want humor and humanity to thrive in your place,
you feed it. I believe in the power of words. I think beautiful words
can feed people.</TE>
<TE>   "As for digging into my own pockets, what else should I spend my
money on? A face lift?" she said, chuckling. "How's that going to
benefit my life, much less anyone else's?"</TE>
<TE>   Poets in Arms</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, McCarthy had brought to town George Hitchcock, a poet
who gave some of America's best writers a start in his now-defunct
magazine, Kayak. It was Hitchcock's 88th birthday, and he and his
wife, Marjorie, had chosen Bakersfield for his first public reading
in 12 years. He was joined by his good friend and fellow poet Richard
Shelton, the bard of the Southwest desert, who had driven in from
Tucson with his wife, Lois.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here because I couldn't have faced Lee if I hadn't,"
Shelton said. "And I came to celebrate the birthday of one of the
most important writers in America." Shelton's first book of poetry,
"The Tattooed Desert," won the International Poetry Forum's United
States Award in 1970, and his fourth collection, "The Bus to
Veracruz," was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book
Award.</TE>
<TE>   It was a literary slight that pushed McCarthy, a high school
English teacher for 35 years, to take up the cause of poetry in a
town where the Kern County arts council didn't recognize literature
as "art." She was thumbing through the pages of "Highway 99," a 1996
collection of prose and poems by Central Valley writers, when she
noticed not a single piece of writing by Frank Bidart, arguably the
greatest poet to grow up in the San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Bidart, a Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle finalist
who has won dozens of national awards, was living and teaching in
Cambridge, Mass. McCarthy wrote a letter to the Bakersfield native
asking if he might consider a reading. "It was as if he had been
waiting all his writing life for someone from his hometown to ask him
back," she said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy had seen a full house turn out for a Levine reading
sponsored by Bakersfield College the year before. She wanted the same
for Bidart, whose extended Basque family still lived and farmed in
town.</TE>
<TE>   She came up with the idea of renting a huge billboard along Oak
Street, a bit of promotion that cost her $1,000. FRANK BIDART IS
COMING HOME, it read, giving the date, time and place of the reading.
Except for the poet's relatives and old classmates at Garces High,
the response to the giant invitation was, "Who in the hell is Frank
Bidart?" McCarthy said. "It got lots of attention and it worked."</TE>
<TE>   Shoestring Poetry</TE>
<TE>   Bidart filled the house, but McCarthy wound up $3,000 in the hole.
This year, she vowed to get a sponsor as she organized an even more
ambitious reading series that began in March with B.H. Fairchild, the
1999 winner of the Poetry Society's William Carlos Williams Award.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy wrote a spirited grant application to the Kern arts
council, a kind of half rebuke that spelled out just why writing in
general and poetry in particular elevated the human condition. It did
not go over well. The arts council came back with a $1,000 grant
offer, not even enough to pay the fee of one poet.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy, who lives alone in a small apartment and spends much of
her small nest egg on books she mails to her son and grandchild and
friends in distant cities, decided to push on without a grant.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were going to have readings, it was going to have to come
out of my pocket," she said. "No, it hasn't been easy. But I think we
benefit as a community from coming together."</TE>
<TE>   In a small downtown gallery, 50 people--a pretty good showing for
a Sunday afternoon reading--came to hear Shelton, 69, and Hitchcock
read from works that have appeared in magazines from the New Yorker
to the Atlantic Monthly.</TE>
<TE>   Shelton read eight or nine poems, some of them political in nature
and some paying homage to the Southwest, "where the wind gropes
through the desert in search of any tree to hold it." Then he
introduced Hitchcock, a playwright, stage and television actor, poet,
publisher and, for the last 11 years exclusively, a painter.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock, a tall man in a black beret and a gray goatee, read a
poem about the wheat fields that stretched across his native Oregon:</TE>
<TE>   A combine comes over the horizon</TE>
<TE>   full-rigged, leaning into a gale of chaff.</TE>
<TE>   A flock of pilgrim geese undulates</TE>
<TE>   in the cloudless sky.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for some message I sit</TE>
<TE>   in the shade of an old oak</TE>
<TE>   but the birds have gone</TE>
<TE>   and I hear the creaking only</TE>
<TE>   of that ghostly immense ship</TE>
<TE>   which harvests the waves.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the gallery, Marcella Yoon said she had come to the
reading at the urging of her sister-in-law, who had driven in from
Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Los Angeles might think this is odd, but they have us
all wrong. We're not all Buck Owens fans here," said Yoon, a 50-year
Bakersfield resident. "I enjoyed the reading and I found it sort of
nostalgic. Two old friends, reading a life's work."</TE>

<HD>A Natural Split With Bush, and Many Quit</HD>
<DH>Environment: Longtime, key officials who favor conservation
say they are frustrated by new rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>James Furnish is hardly the kind of person you'd expect to quit his
government job on principle during the Bush administration. A
political conservative and an evangelical Christian, he voted for
President Bush and plans to do the same in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   As a deputy chief of the U.S. Forest Service, he was eager to give
his new bosses the benefit of his more than 30 years of experience in
the agency. He realized his conservationist ethic might not always
prevail. But he was ready to say his piece and then accept the new
administration's direction.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Furnish reluctantly left the government in the fall, at a
substantial financial sacrifice, because he was frustrated by what he
called the Bush team's strident pro-development philosophy and
unwillingness to even listen to his perspective.</LD>
<TE>   That makes him one of a number of senior career officials across
several environmental agencies who have quit since the Bush
administration took over. They include senior lawyers from the
Environmental Protection Agency, a state director for the Bureau of
Land Management, scientists with years of experience and top
bureaucrats in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them left in protest, silent or loud. Others left because
they believed the new administration had put them on a shelf, and
they refused to stay there.</TE>
<TE>   But in each case, the decision to leave a well-paid job after
years or even decades of service reflected concern over the Bush
administration's efforts to make environmental regulations more
friendly to businesses and promote energy extraction from federal
lands.</TE>
<TE>   The departures also reveal that under the Bush team, divergent
views in the top ranks of these agencies have been ignored and key
career government officials who were seen to favor protecting natural
resources over promoting their use have been removed from power.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the number of departures is unusual is difficult to say.
No one chronicles resignations on principle, and a Republican had not
taken the White House from a Democrat for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Ruff, spokesman for the Interior Department, said staff
changes were normal in a new administration. "This is not something
that's unique to this administration," Ruff said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the departures are unusually numerous, Paul Light,
vice president for governmental studies at the nonpartisan Brookings
Institution, said they were very costly.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these people came to government in the 1960s and 1970s
because they believed in the mission," Light said. "It's very
frustrating for someone who came into government for the mission to
reach the top of their career and be told that doesn't matter, it's
all about politics."</TE>
<TE>   Although Furnish, for example, was one of the most senior career
officials in the Forest Service, the new administration's political
appointees did not invite him to any pivotal policy-making meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Three times he was scheduled to testify before Congress; three
times political appointees canceled his testimony at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   Furnish did not expect to make policy for the new administration,
but he did expect that his senior post would give him the right to
express his views and be included in policy discussions. Instead, he
was shut out.</TE>
<TE>   In the Clinton administration, he played a key role in shaping the
policy of banning road building and logging in almost 60 million
acres of national forest land. He was also central to an initiative
that would have required forest planners to consider environmental
preservation above all other goals when deciding how national forests
would be managed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been disappointed and somewhat embittered with how the
[Bush] administration has sought to undo them or not defend them,"
Furnish said. "But I'm a realist and pragmatist and I understand it's
their day now."</TE>
<TE>   Furnish took a financial hit by leaving when he did. His
retirement income will be about $10,000 less a year for the rest of
his life than if he had waited about a year longer.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service Chief Dale N. Bosworth said Furnish was
experiencing the predictable discomforts of a shift in
administration, which he may have escaped earlier in his career
because he was stationed in national forests in the Rocky Mountains
and coastal Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we have a change of administration, we have a job of
building trust between us and the new administration," said Bosworth,
who is also a career government employee. "Until we build that
relationship, there is going to be some uneasiness."</TE>
<TE>   Like Furnish, other top career executives in the environmental
agencies complain they were cut out of the loop. Some were abruptly
reassigned.</TE>
<TE>   When the Bush administration took office, Martha Hahn, 47, was one
of very few women who had reached the level of state director for the
Bureau of Land Management. She was responsible for 12 million acres
in Idaho, almost one-quarter of the state.</TE>
<TE>   In seven years on the job, she said, she tried to balance
preserving clean water, wilderness and wildlife with allowing
multiple uses of the land, such as grazing.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Bush administration took over, things changed.
Headquarters started making decisions on her turf without her. Some
of her decisions, such as those on grazing plans, were overruled in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But even before the new BLM chief officially started work, Hahn
received a letter from Deputy Interior Secretary Steven Griles
telling her that she was being transferred to a previously
nonexistent job in New York City. For a land manager who loves the
Rocky Mountain West, it was the equivalent of being put out to
pasture.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn quit instead. "It's been a shock," she said. "I'm going
through mental anguish right now. I felt like I was at the prime of
my career. I was really clicking along, and I was tossed out."</TE>
<TE>   The career official who made the most waves when he left was Eric
Schaeffer, the former head of the EPA's enforcement office. He quit
in March after 12 years at the agency, accusing the new
administration of endangering public health by failing to
aggressively pursue pending lawsuits against coal-fired power plants.</TE>
<TE>   His departure was covered widely by the news media, which he said
surprised him, and he testified about his complaints before Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Anger played a big role in Schaeffer's decision to leave.</TE>
<TE>   He and his staff could almost taste the victory from agreements in
principle with two utilities to make massive pollution reductions. He
said the administration undermined those settlements by waffling on
the policy behind the lawsuits. He described himself as "furious all
the time."</TE>
<TE>   Other officials have left more quietly, and some declined to be
quoted by name for this article.</TE>
<TE>   Light has heard similar complaints before.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the first administration to say to a career person, is
that the only science that's available?" he said. "The lesson this
administration learned from the Reagan administration is that
regulations matter, control of science matters and keeping decisions
to a very small number of highly motivated loyal lieutenants
matters."</TE>
<TE>   Younger government employees who became government servants to
help protect the environment have also quit.</TE>
<TE>   After just three years as an EPA staff attorney, Michele Merkel,
34, was convinced of the essential role that lawsuits and fines play
in forcing companies to abide by environmental regulations,
especially when whole industries are systematically ignoring
pollution laws.</TE>
<TE>   She was discouraged when Christie Whitman, the EPA's new
administrator, told her unit she wanted to play down enforcement and
instead lure companies to stop polluting voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   She was further disappointed when Whitman proposed cutting the
enforcement budget and reducing the enforcement staff through
attrition.</TE>
<TE>   To Merkel, the frustration grew unbearable when this policy
affected her ability to vigorously pursue cases in her specialty,
concentrated animal feeding lots, which pollute waterways with excess
nutrients and send ammonia and other toxins into the air. She found
that the agriculture industry's sway over the administration was
making it increasingly difficult to crack down on corporate farms.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately what drove me out of the agency was the
anti-enforcement philosophy of the current administration," Merkel
said.</TE>
<TE>   Merkel and the other officials who quit said they left many
disgruntled colleagues behind.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Rook, executive director of Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility, said his agency has talked with at
least 20 Interior employees weighing quitting.</TE>
<TE>   "They find themselves increasingly despairing; they're being asked
to undo the work they've spent the bulk of their careers doing," Rook
said.</TE>

<DH>Education: High school students learn personal and
vocational skills through eight-week programs at Valley College
academy.</DH>

<LD>In front of the California Army National Guard Armory in Van Nuys,
Lilit Ojakhyan calls out the names of fellow teens who are getting a
close-up look at guns, vehicles and equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Her peers, divided into three platoons, stand at attention and
await her commands.</LD>
<LD>   A three-student color guard solemnly marches to the flagpole near
a large rock garden where 1st Sgt. Ojakhyan is positioned. After the
flags are raised, the nearly 80 high school students pledge
allegiance.</LD>
<TE>   It's Day 3 of Valley College's Leadership Academy, a program run
in conjunction with the Los Angeles Unified School District and the
California Army National Guard. The program aims to instill
participants with loyalty, self-respect and discipline.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership academy, which will have its graduation ceremony
Saturday, is one of six such programs at Valley College. Last week,
66 students in Valley's wild-land firefighting academy and 48
students in its robotics academy graduated.</TE>
<TE>   The college also offers special programs in emergency medical
services and firefighting. Each program lasts about eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to replicate these programs at all nine campuses in
the Los Angeles Community College District, said John Burke, an
accounting instructor and the director of School to Careers programs
at Valley College.</TE>
<TE>   "We're using the academies to improve academic achievement in high
school, so when they come to us [as college students], they will be
better prepared," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley College was the first campus in the district to offer a
weekend program for high school students when it founded the
firefighting academy in 1999. The program has been duplicated at
Harbor, West Los Angeles and East Los Angeles campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point is to recruit high school students to our
academic program and to get them connected to a career," said Rodger
McGinness, dean of academic affairs at Valley College.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership academy, the newest of the programs at Valley
College, has the look and feel of a Junior ROTC program, with not so
much marching.</TE>
<TE>   The academy begins at "0900 hours" each Saturday. Adults are
addressed as "sir" or ma'am" and students have to sign out to use the
"latrine." Everyone wears a uniform: blue jeans, tennis shoes, black
cap and a black T-shirt emblazoned with "Los Angeles Valley College
Leadership Academy."</TE>
<TE>   Half of the day is spent in college classrooms, where instructors
from the National Guard teach military protocol and principles of
leadership. The other half is spent at the armory, getting familiar
with Humvees and the high-tech equipment used by the military.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't run it as basic training. We just want to be good
mentors to them," said Col. Philip Butch, a California Army National
Guard commander. "When I was in the 10th grade, I didn't know what I
wanted to do. Age 30 comes quick. We want them to realize a GPA does
count, an SAT score does count."</TE>
<TE>   Students say the Leadership Academy is having an effect on their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Color guard member Amber Hirsch, one of 49 girls in the leadership
academy, said the program has given her new pride in the U.S. and
more confidence in herself.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, when somebody was doing something the same as me and
only I got in trouble, I would get mad," said Hirsch,  who lives in
Highland Park and attends Van Nuys High School. "They've taught me I
have to be the bigger person and not worry about it."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Torres, a junior at Grant High School in Van Nuys, said he's
a "better person" since enrolling in the academy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm learning how to take charge, but not to overpower my
teammates," said Torres, who will graduate from the Leadership
Academy this weekend. "It's teaching me to be a team player. You need
those [skills] in everyday life. I'm getting more out of it than I
thought I would."</TE>
<TE>   The academies are taught by specialists in their fields.</TE>
<TE>   "The instructors in the academies can inspire and motivate these
young people and show them a whole new world," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the National Tooling
and Machining Assn. teach the Robotics Academy, an electronics
course; U.S. Forest Service officials teach the Wildland Fire
Academy; and paramedics teach the Emergency Medical Services Academy.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, an advanced Fire Drill Tower Academy--to teach
firefighting in tall buildings--will be offered in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In October, a new Justice Academy, taught by Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputies, will begin.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the academy, students receive high school credit and
two or three units of college credit.</TE>
<TE>   Valley College is offering its academies this year under a
$289,000 state Department of Education grant, which also includes
money for developing high school curriculum to coordinate with each
program, Burke said.</TE>

<HD>They Walk to Fight a Killer</HD>
<DH>Health: AIDS walk at UC Irvine draws more than 10,000 and
raises nearly $711,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the third year in a row, Rancho Alamitos High School, home to
just 1,600 students, raised more money than any other school in the
16th AIDS Walk Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   "We consider this a very good project," said Julie Le of Rancho
Alamitos, who was joined on Sunday's walk at UC Irvine by more than
50 of her classmates. "This issue is something we take very
seriously."</LD>
<LD>   AIDS has killed more than 3,100 people in Orange County, according
to health department figures.</LD>
<TE>   Rancho Alamitos raised more than $4,700 from the AIDS walk, and
from selling strawberry shortcake last month at a swap meet at the
Orange County Fairgrounds. Walk organizers estimate that more than
10,000 participants raised nearly $711,000 for AIDS prevention and
support services by gathering pledges and walking 5K and 10K routes
around UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Since it began in 1987, the event has raised more than $6 million
for agencies that provide food, housing, medical, education and other
services to those affected by AIDS. Walk organizers estimate that
about 10,000 people are infected with HIV in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl Jemison-Smith, co-chairwoman of the walk, said the goal this
year is to alert young people to the dangers of HIV and AIDS. She
said that nationally, two young people become infected with HIV every
hour.</TE>
<TE>   The prevention message is not getting out to young people,
Jemison-Smith said, and fund-raising has been especially difficult
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people gave to the 9/11 fund, and the economy is down,"
she said. "And others are saying, 'I'm tired of AIDS. Let's go on to
another disease now.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, the crowds grow," said Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden
Grove), who participated in her sixth AIDS walk. "People are
beginning to realize that AIDS affects all of us, not just gays."
Sanchez said families are the newest affected group.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finding that people who are in monogamous relationships are
coming in contact with AIDS," she said. "Husbands are bringing home
this dreaded disease to their wives. We need to educate our
communities more about the dangers."</TE>

<HD>Rogers Albritton, 78; Philosopher Known for His Brilliance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rogers Albritton, a charismatic philosopher who rarely published his
work yet dazzled colleagues of diverse persuasions with his lucid
analyses of fundamental human dilemmas, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   The former UCLA and Harvard University professor died May 21 of
pneumonia at UCLA Medical Center. A heavy smoker for most of his
life, he had emphysema and had been in declining health.</LD>
<LD>   Called a philosopher's philosopher, he was considered one of the
most formidable intellects in his field. His legendary stature,
however, stemmed not from his writings, but from what philosopher and
film critic Stanley Cavell called "the charisma of ... conversation
alone."</LD>
<TE>   He was famous for marathon conversations about philosophy. A
discussion lasting six or eight hours was not unusual. A former
student once reported talking with Albritton for 11 hours.</TE>
<TE>   In such encounters, the lean and stylish Princeton-trained thinker
loved nothing more than to explore such matters as the nature of
evil, free will or reality. Conversing with him was not like sitting
downstream of a flood; he did not lecture. Rather, he probed gently,
asking many questions in Socratic fashion to illuminate hidden
dimensions of a philosophical problem.</TE>
<TE>   Famously nondoctrinaire, even though he was an expert on the
Greeks and Ludwig Wittgenstein, he was averse to ever declaring that
a problem was solved. He could argue that a person had no way of
knowing whether he was asleep or awake, then conclude the opposite
after more hours of laughter-filled discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a kind of philosophical conscience," said philosopher
Thomas Nagel, an Albritton student who now teaches at New York
University. "Almost all of the rest of us ... fall back on the stuff
we think we've established.... Rogers was a reminder that you can
never dispense with the obligation to actively think whatever you're
thinking and be prepared to think it through from the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   "Back about 25 years ago ... Peter Strawson [an eminent British
philosopher] said Rogers was one of the 10 best philosophers in the
world," said Hilary Putnam, a past president of the American
Philosophical Assn. and emeritus professor at Harvard. "Many would
agree, including myself. He was quite unique.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me the feeling for what Socrates must have been like.
Socrates didn't publish much either. Like Socrates, he had a lot of
impact on lots of philosophers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Feeling for Socrates</TE>
<TE>   Putnam recalled a discussion with Albritton some years ago on
realism. "He illuminated a whole problem area for me--he made [it]
worse. That's what Rogers, and Socrates, often did. The ground you
thought was firm suddenly shakes beneath your feet.... Other things
you hadn't considered now felt large in your mind."</TE>
<TE>   Putnam, whose teachers included such great thinkers as the late
W.V. Quine, said he "learned more about the difficulties of
philosophy--why it is hard--from Rogers" than from anyone else. "All
the others felt it was easy. He [made] you distrust anybody who
thinks he has the key to all the problems."</TE>
<TE>   Albritton rose to the UC system's highest level of
professorship--an elite rank referred to as "above scale"--despite a
severe disinclination to participate in the academic convention of
"publish-or-perish." Over four decades of teaching, he published only
about four papers, none considered definitive. Most appeared before
he left a tenured position at Harvard to join the philosophy faculty
at UCLA in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   His seeming disinterest in publishing his thoughts was mystifying
to those who knew him.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke beautifully, using metaphors as naturally as a great
novelist. "My God, he talks the way Henry James writes," Putnam
recalled once thinking. Writing--and publishing what he wrote--should
have been just as natural.</TE>
<TE>   Except for one address, however, Albritton published nothing
during the last two decades of his career. The joke in philosophy
circles was that his last name was a contraction of "All But
Written."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, that phrase was an Albritton family joke.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Errett, was a physiologist and accomplished research
scientist who rarely published his findings. "He could not bring
himself to be satisfied that he had enough of the final answer to
publish. Rogers was like that as well," said Albritton's sister,
Heloise Frame, a New York psychotherapist, who survives him along
with seven nieces and nephews.</TE>
<TE>   Albritton was born in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 15, 1923. When he
was 3, his father and chemist-mother Rietta moved the family to
Bangkok, where Albritton senior founded a medical school with a
Rockefeller foundation grant.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 5, his father decided to send him to a British
boarding school in India, where he was the only American student.
Much later he told his sister that it had been terrifying to be so
far from home so young.</TE>
<TE>   Returning home a year later, he horrified his mother when he
greeted her by clicking his heels and bowing in the British manner.
After that display, his father agreed to end his education abroad.</TE>
<TE>   He completed his elementary and secondary schooling in Maryland
and Washington, D.C. At 15, he enrolled at Swarthmore College,
transferring two years later to St. Johns College, the Annapolis,
Md., school famous for its emphasis on the Great Books. There
Albritton began his formal training in philosophy, focusing on Plato
and the Greeks. After two years with the Air Force in Hawaii after
Pearl Harbor, he earned his bachelor's degree from St. Johns and his
doctorate, in 1955, from Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   He taught briefly at Cornell University, then joined the Harvard
faculty in 1956. He chaired Harvard's philosophy department from 1963
to 1970.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leaving Cambridge</TE>
<TE>   But he began to feel that Cambridge was too strait-laced and was
intrigued by Los Angeles and its diversity. "My brother was gay and
very comfortable to let that be what it was," Frame said. "He said at
UCLA he could be who he was. That was partly someone who didn't
publish but was a wonderful teacher.... And the fact that he was gay
was something that didn't stagger Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   He came to UCLA for a year in 1972 and stayed, making his home in
West Hollywood and later in Silver Lake. A past president of the
American Philosophical Assn. and member of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, he taught courses on Greek philosophy, philosophy
of mind, metaphysics, Wittgenstein and Descartes, and was an active
member of the faculty until well past his official retirement in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   He was a gifted teacher. At Harvard he co-taught with Marshall
Cohen, dean emeritus of USC's College of Letters, Arts and Sciences,
a legendary course called Humanities 5. It was hugely popular--Cohen
recalled that one year the registration swelled to 700 students.
Students were in awe of Albritton, watching him tear up his notes and
appear to struggle along with them through complicated philosophical
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "He lectured as if he were struggling throughout the hour to
figure out what he was going to say," recalled Nagel, who was one of
Albritton's teaching assistants. "This was a dramatic performance,
but it had the form of extemporary philosophical creation."</TE>
<TE>   Albritton saw everything through a philosopher's eyes. Some years
ago he was called to jury duty on a case that posed what he
recognized as a complex philosophical problem. The defendant was
accused of illegal possession of a machine gun. What he owned were
all the gun's parts, disassembled and scattered about his house.
Albritton "spent a huge amount of time thinking and worrying about
the metaphysics of this," UCLA professor David Kaplan recalled. "Do
you possess a machine gun if you possess the parts, and how spread
out do the parts have to be?" The jury voted for acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he lay in the hospital last month, Albritton wrestled
aloud with philosophical questions. John Carriero, who chairs UCLA's
philosophy department, spent one of his last visits with the dying
man puzzling over the problem of evil posed in a passage of Isaiah.
Albritton, hooked up to all manner of tubes and monitors, asked his
colleague to research the views of 13th-century theologian Thomas
Aquinas and report back to him.</TE>
<TE>   "The reasons these disputes never end," he once said of
philosophers' struggles with age-old questions, "is that both sides
are right about important things. I am inclined to think there is
truth and nonsense on both sides, but the truth is very hard to
find."</TE>

<HD>Each Side in Secession Debate Puts Own Spin on 'Alimony'</HD>
<DH>Revenue: L.A. officials say Hollywood and the Valley would
have to cut services or raise taxes. Breakup backers accuse the city
of scare tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The money that the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood would have to
pay Los Angeles to leave the city is dominating the secession debate,
as both sides try to play the so-called alimony to their advantage.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles officials say the annual payments--designed to
compensate the city for tax revenues lost to secession--would result
in decreased services and increased taxes in the Valley and
Hollywood. They also contend the reparations would not cover all of
Los Angeles' losses.</LD>
<LD>   But secessionists dismiss those contentions as scare tactics. They
say the alimony requirement is actually a compelling argument for
secession--proof that Los Angeles takes more tax dollars out of the
Valley and Hollywood than it returns in the form of city services.</LD>
<TE>   The state law forcing some new municipalities to pay alimony is
just 9 years old, and it has never been tested in a secession
campaign. Where the rule has been applied--to smaller cities minted
from unincorporated county territory--disputes have sometimes
followed.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles voters will decide Nov. 5 whether to approve the
Valley secession plan. On Wednesday, the Local Agency Formation
Commission is expected to place the Hollywood proposal on the same
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO cannot put a secession measure on the ballot if it finds
that a breakup would harm the city. The alimony payments are supposed
to ensure that Los Angeles suffers no net loss in tax revenues.</TE>
<TE>   For the Valley, the payments would start at $128 million annually,
then gradually fall to zero in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood payment would begin at about $21 million and also
fade out over two decades.</TE>
<TE>   The first installment for each city would equal 11% of its budget.
LAFCO determined, however, that both breakaway cities would remain
financially healthy after making the payments.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials scoff at that finding. And even as they
demand higher and higher alimony payments, they say the new cities
could not afford them without raising taxes or slashing services.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get divorced, and I've been divorced, you forget about
alimony and child support and all those extra costs," City Councilman
Dennis Zine said. "You think you are going to have all kinds of money
to buy a new car and a new Harley and take trips around the world. It
isn't like that."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn says there is nothing inconsistent in the
city's positions, including its stance that the Valley and Hollywood
get a level of services on par with the taxes they pay.</TE>
<TE>   As for the assertion that the alimony burden proves the
secessionist areas are shortchanged, Hahn said, "It's not true."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said LAFCO's determination that Los Angeles spends $98
million a year less in the Valley than it takes out in taxes greatly
underestimates the centralized costs of some services--costs that
would continue after secession. Those include the 911 emergency
system and downtown staffing for departments with citywide
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "When you build a big house for a big family to live in, just
because a third of the family moves out doesn't necessarily reduce
your expenses of maintaining that house by one-third," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   But the secessionists say Hahn's warnings of financial ruin are
hollow because the alimony payments, at their peak, would equal less
than 5% of Los Angeles' total budget, which would be about $3.5
billion if the Valley and Hollywood secede.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists say they will stress the alimony in the
pro-independence campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps us in the Valley because that alimony payment is largely
the amount we've been subsidizing the remainder of the city," said
Richard Close, chairman of the secessionist group Valley VOTE. "It
helps us south of Mulholland Drive because it is a sizable payment
and it shows steps were taken to protect Los Angeles from financial
harm."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles would be the first city to receive alimony since the
law was enacted, but several counties are getting the payments from
recently incorporated municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   Counties sought the alimony rule because each incorporation
diverted a slice of property taxes and other revenues to the new
city.</TE>
<TE>   "Before 1993, the new cities got to keep all of the money
generated in their territorial boundaries," LAFCO Executive Director
Larry Calemine said. "The counties woke up and said, 'My God, we're
going to go broke if all the unincorporated areas incorporate as
cities.'"</TE>
<TE>   So no matter how many happily married couples live in Goleta,
Aliso Viejo and Laguna Woods, all the residents of those three cities
are now paying a form of alimony.</TE>
<TE>   In Goleta, which became a city in February, Mayor Margaret Connell
said the annual payment to Santa Barbara County of roughly $3 million
will force the new city to be frugal.</TE>
<TE>   "What it means is we are not going to have a lot of money to
spare," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Aliso Viejo City Manager Bill Woollett said the $1.2 million his
city must pay Orange County for seven years is "fair and equitable,"
even though it is more than 10% of the city's $11-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Woods is paying Orange County $405,000 annually for seven
years, also about 10% of its $4-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Most cities incorporate because they want to recapture that tax
money they are losing, and then they have to continue to pay it,"
said Laguna Woods City Manager Leslie Keane. "It is very ironic."</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a city reneged.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Citrus Heights incorporated, the city's leaders
refused to pay $5.6 million in alimony to Sacramento County. They
contended the payment would eventually plunge Citrus Heights into
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute ended up in court, but the two sides settled by
agreeing on a smaller payment.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine sought to protect Los Angeles against a Citrus Heights
scenario.</TE>
<TE>   He included in the secession proposals a requirement that all
property and sales taxes collected by the county go to a third-party
agent for disbursement to the cities. The agent also would make the
alimony payment.</TE>

<HD>Open Season for Arson</HD>
<DH>Crime: Most brush fires in L.A. are intentionally and
easily set, officials say, with arrests made in only a small
percentage of the cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Firefighters have a sixth sense for red flag days, those with
triple-digit temperatures, single-digit humidity and howling Santa
Ana winds.</LD>
<LD>   Arsonists, too, may have this sense. "The majority of fires in
this town are set," said Bill Cass, a senior investigator in the Los
Angeles Fire Department's arson section.</LD>
<LD>   The recent rash of intentionally set brush fires in Griffith Park
shows how vulnerable Southern California can be. On two different
days at the park, one of the nation's largest urban wilderness areas,
someone started a second blaze while firefighters were still battling
the first.</LD>
<TE>   "Wild-land arson is pretty simple," said Karen Terrill, a
spokeswoman for the state's Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection. "California's wild lands are more than willing to burn."</TE>
<TE>   Arsonists caused more than 300 vegetation fires in the city of Los
Angeles in the past 12 months, out of a total 460 fires that burned
anything from a few square feet of grass to more than 80 acres of
brush. Less than a quarter of all arson fires investigated last year
resulted in arrests. The rate drops for brush fires.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County fire investigators believe an arsonist started the
1,100-acre Rancho Santa Margarita blaze that threatened
million-dollar homes on a hot dry afternoon May 13. Fire crews
responded swiftly in overwhelming numbers. That, combined with an
early aggressive brush-clearing effort that formed a natural fire
break, was credited for preventing damage or serious injury. Arson
investigators later found several spots along a local road where they
believe the fire was deliberately set.</TE>
<TE>   Some arsonists start fires by chucking emergency flares out car
windows and into brush alongside roads. Others drop a time-delayed
matchbook device into a patch of wild grass, giving themselves a
chance to flee before the fire starts.</TE>
<TE>   The brush fire arsonist--nicknamed "pyro" or "torch" by some
investigators--is typically young, white, male and a loner, according
to experts. He is difficult to catch because his motives are not as
obvious as those of, for instance, someone who collects insurance on
a fire-gutted building. The crime is generally executed in a remote
area, deep in the brush or along a hiking trail.</TE>
<TE>   Without an eyewitness--which is a rare stroke of luck--the only
thing authorities can do is collect physical evidence and wait for
the arsonist to strike again.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, someone may get a license plate," Los Angeles arson
investigator Tim Crass said on a recent afternoon, as he and partner
Mike Camello canvassed the smoldering remains of a six-acre fire in
the Sepulveda Pass. The blaze had scorched a hillside dotted with
sumac bushes and willow grass next to the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Weather conditions--warm, but not overly dry--pointed to an
intentionally set blaze, as did the fact that another brush fire had
occurred two days before 11/2 miles away in the same windblown pass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Searching for Clues</TE>
<TE>   A carelessly discarded cigarette, maybe? There were cigarette
butts mixed with rocks and dried grass along the side of the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Not likely, said Camello, the lead investigator. There was too
much moisture in the air and not enough dense brush for a lighted
cigarette to cause real damage.</TE>
<TE>   Shielded from traffic by a row of fire engines, Camello and Crass
walked up and down a freeway shoulder crisscrossed by fire hoses and
surveyed the length of the blackened hill. County fire crews looking
for surviving hot spots dislodged dirt and rocks, which rolled down
to where the investigators were working.</TE>
<TE>   They already had an idea of where the fire had flared up, based on
a witness account, but they needed to see if their own observations
would lead them to the same source. They also needed to find an
incendiary object, if possible.</TE>
<TE>   The shape of the burned area--roughly three large Vs--pointed to
three spots about 130 feet apart at the bottom of the hill. From
there, the fire had spread out and up the hillside. The investigators
looked at individual shrubs and found that they were more severely
burned on the sides facing the points of origin.</TE>
<TE>   Patiently examining the ashen terrain, they came upon the evidence
they needed to rule the incident the handiwork of an arsonist.
"Things look different after they burn up," Crass said. "But after
looking at thousands of them, you start to recognize them."</TE>
<TE>   After two hours' work, the investigators were satisfied with their
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   By the arson unit's standards, a couple of brush fires in one area
do not indicate a series. Ten or more suspicious fires, however,
begin to look like the work of a serial arsonist. In such cases, fire
officials set up patrols and surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ease of Starting Fires</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, arsons make up 10% to 15% of all vegetation fires, a
smaller percentage than in Los Angeles. Most brush fires are started
by mistake. Using a lawnmower without a spark arrester in brushy
areas or parking a car with a hot undercarriage above dry grass are
two examples.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time, it's good people who just don't appreciate how
easy it is to start a fire," Terrill said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, arsonists have been responsible for some of the most
destructive brush fires in the state's recent history.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the 10 most destructive brush fires (in terms of number of
buildings lost) in the last century were started by arsonists,
including a wind-driven blaze in Santa Barbara County in June 1990
that claimed 641 homes and one resident's life in a six-hour span,
causing $500 million in damage.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a fire of infamy for us," said Capt. Charlie Johnson of
the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. "The fact that there was
only one fatality was beyond belief."</TE>
<TE>   Arson was behind two devastating brush fires in the fall of 1993:
the Laguna Beach fire that claimed 389 homes and burned more than
14,000 acres, and the Malibu blaze that destroyed 323 homes and
consumed 18,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of acreage, an arsonist was also responsible for the
seventh most destructive fire in the last century: the 1985 Wheeler
Springs fire in Ventura County, which burned 118,000 acres, or the
equivalent of 90,000 football fields.</TE>
<TE>   People who intentionally start fires are of several psychological
types, ranging from fraud arsonists to psychotics, said Dian
Williams, an arson profiler who has interviewed hundreds of
firesetters between the ages of 3 and 72. Those who attack wild lands
are generally delinquents or thrill-seekers.</TE>
<TE>   Delinquent arsonists set fires spontaneously, often in the company
of a group of people out partying in a remote area.</TE>
<TE>   "They just think it is tremendously funny," said Williams, who
heads the nonprofit Center for Arson Research in Lafayette Hill, Pa.
"They don't think about the consequences of the behavior. Afterward,
they're just shocked and stunned" by the damage they have caused.</TE>
<TE>   Thrill-seekers gain satisfaction from watching something burn
because of them. "It's representative to them of their power and
their ability to bring fire departments to their knees," Williams
said. These arsonists exercise more forethought, studying weather
conditions and scouting out especially vulnerable brush in order to
get the maximum effect.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Appeal of Firesetting</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's most notorious firesetter was a firefighter,
Glendale arson investigator John Leonard Orr, who is serving a life
prison term for a series of structure and brush arsons that ended
with his arrest in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   His crimes included a wildfire in the College Hills section of
Glendale that damaged or destroyed 67 homes and a fire at a South
Pasadena hardware store in which four people died.</TE>
<TE>   Such arsonists "will set [a fire] both to create the excitement,
and also to fight it and be there as part of it," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   For arson investigators, finding out the why behind an arson isn't
as crucial as discovering the who.</TE>
<TE>   "The motives behind why they're doing it can be whatever's going
on in their head," said Cass, the senior investigator.</TE>

<LD>Having grown up on the rough streets of the Brownsville section of
Brooklyn during the Great Depression, Herman Berman knows what it's
like to be hungry.</LD>
<LD>   It is that familiarity with hunger that drives him now.</LD>
<LD>   Almost every morning around 7, Berman, the commander of the
volunteer Bagel Brigade, organizes his troops in the parking lot of a
Costco on Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys.</LD>
<TE>   The volunteers, as many as 120 of them, fan out to the poorest
parts of the San Fernando Valley armed with day-old bagels, bread and
pastries provided free by boutique bakeries and supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Berman said the need is so great that he is desperate to find more
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   In April alone, the Bagel Brigade distributed 84,603 loaves of
bread and 54,745 bagels, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Berman said the effort, which does not involve any exchange of
money, began in 1995 when he went to a Valley supermarket to ask the
management if he could put a sign on a basket urging people to leave
a can of food for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   One morning soon after, wearing a badge that read "I'm a volunteer
for food for the needy," Berman went to buy a bagel at Manhattan
Bagels on Van Nuys Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   A young clerk, Kimberly Martin, suggested Berman take their
day-old bagels.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was a great idea," the retired jeweler recalled.
"We can take these to schools and senior citizen centers and other
places that need help. Then I thought, 'If we can collect bagels, why
not bread?'"</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Berman was at it full time, and the Bagel Brigade was born.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bagel Brigade has been a blessing to our community," said
Maritza de Artan, director of Casa Esperanza, a nonprofit that serves
the poor residents of the Blythe Street neighborhood in Panorama
City.</TE>
<TE>   And, De Artan said, the food giveaway has given the residents of
Blythe Street the opportunity to sample baked goods they might never
buy otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   When Casa Esperanza gets a Bagel Brigade delivery, a sign goes up
outside that reads simply: "Mucho Pan"--lots of bread.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids come in asking for a 'long bread,'" said De Artan, using
the youngsters' term for a baguette. "And they take the bagels, split
and toast them and make them Mexican. They put beans on the bagels.
For the kids, it's a treat."</TE>
<TE>   Berman, like many volunteers, is a member of the Encino chapter of
the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish social service organization.</TE>
<TE>   He said he started the Bagel Brigade primarily for children.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe a child who goes to bed hungry grows up to be a problem
to themselves and the community," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind he gets volunteers to go to the various
stores--Ralphs, Vons, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and smaller
bakeries--to pick up the day-old baked goods.</TE>
<TE>   The food is taken to the Costco lot, where it is sorted for
delivery to Valley schools, senior citizen homes and community
service organizations.</TE>
<TE>   One of the many suppliers of goods is Brooklyn Bagel Bakery near
Echo Park.</TE>
<TE>   "After hearing about the good work they do, we were more than
willing to participate," owner Richard Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   Every Wednesday, Carl Koski, 40, makes a delivery to Sun Valley
Middle School, where the food is distributed to low-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The families are so happy to take that bread. It's really a nice
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Although he lives in a comfortable, three-bedroom home, Berman
vividly remembers the poverty of his youth.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in the midst of poverty in Brownsville, but I never saw
the vast poverty I see here in such high numbers," he said. "It just
hurts me to see a hungry person."</TE>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Thankfully, with the Lakers-Kings playoff series now over, we're
less likely to be hearing that insulting "cow town" talk from L.A.</LD>
<LD>   It's almost as offensive as the idiotic cowbell clanging in
Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   You may recall the history: Lakers Coach Phil Jackson branded
Sacramento a "cow town" two years ago. (Still running, perhaps, from
his prairie roots in North Dakota.) Then a Sacramento entrepreneur
made a killing by selling thousands of cowbells to loonies sitting
behind the visitors' bench.</TE>
<TE>   And it deteriorated from there.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson called Sacramento basketball fans "semi-civilized." This
was a semi-compliment, the coach explained, because he was comparing
Sacramentans to fans in Puerto Rico, where "when you won on a
visiting floor, your tires were slashed and you might be chased out
of town with rocks." In Sacramento, he continued, "those people are
just maybe redneck in some form or fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, OK. Sure do appreciate that, Phil.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't stop with Jackson. He inspired others to pile on with
put-downs, including sports writers at this newspaper, which
paradoxically is trying to sell subscriptions in the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   "Yokels," we were called--"those sentenced to life in Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   "Farmers." Actually, there are nearly as many farmers in L.A.
County as in Sacramento, except that most L.A. farms are puny.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings play in a "barn," it's repeatedly written, where fans
clop in their "work boots." It is true that a substantially larger
percentage of Sacramentans work--hold jobs--than do Angelenos,
according to unemployment stats.</TE>
<TE>   But if Arco Arena is a barn, what is Staples Center? An armory? A
National Guard staging area for the post-game riot?</TE>
<TE>   By the way, you've got a 72% greater chance of being killed by a
bad guy in L.A. than in Sacramento, according to the latest state
crime report.</TE>
<TE>   Let alone be pulverized by an earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   And Sacto "yokels" seem to be more computer literate than
Angelenos, a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California
found. Computer usage is higher here.</TE>
<TE>   You've guessed it, I'm biased, having moved to Sacramento three
times--from congested, high-cost, high-strung Washington, L.A. and
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   I grew up in Southern California and still am amazed there are two
big rivers here that actually run year-around, carrying salmon and
steelhead. There are laid-back restaurants up and down the Sacramento
where you can tie up a boat.</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 25 miles down river from the
capital, has 1,000 miles of meandering, navigable waterways. Much of
it is shaded by cottonwoods, sycamores and oaks, with wild berries
and bass. It's not Disneyland, but it's real and it's free.</TE>
<TE>   Cow town? If only it were true. One local gripe is that Sacramento
is starting to resemble L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area people are pouring into the valley looking for affordable
housing. (Home median prices: Bay Area $402,000, L.A. County
$254,000, Sacramento $180,000.)</TE>
<TE>   But this still is not L.A.-like.</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos spend 65% more time stuck in traffic than do
Sacramentans, one think tank estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Smog here is not getting worse. It's getting better--just not as
fast as in L.A., which nevertheless remains smoggier.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. air has improved as fast as Sacramento's basketball team,"
notes Jerry Martin, spokesman for the state Air Resources Board.</TE>
<TE>   There's a myth--maybe born of L.A.'s own frustration--that people
living outside of L.A. are envious of those stuck inside. That
everyone else is living under L.A.'s shadow.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry. Except for politicians, few here think much about L.A. It's
not envied nor hated. People just thank their lucky stars they don't
live there.</TE>
<TE>   But enjoying Sacramento does tend to be an acquired taste. Some
never acquire it.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's where the Capitol is," quips veteran Sen. Tom
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks). "Why I don't know. I wasn't consulted."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) says: "I love Sacramento. It's
very similar to a lot of Midwest cities. It's got small town
ideals--community, family....</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a rabid fan of the Lakers, but I have to respectively
disagree with Phil Jackson."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd move back in a heartbeat," says Joan Stern, who left
Sacramento for L.A. 19 years ago. But her husband, Bob Stern,
president of the Center for Governmental Studies, says, "I'm not so
sure." They live in a Malibu townhouse overlooking the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles), who just bought a home close
to the Capitol in a neighborhood called Hollywood Park, says: "It's a
nice town, but not at playoff time. At playoff time, it's a cow
town."</TE>
<TE>   Just don't call us redneck yokels.</TE>
<TE>   But you can call us lousy free throw shooters.</TE>

<HD>Faith in New Church Undiminished</HD>
<DH>Land use: Cottonwood congregants are joined by others in
Cypress who decry the city's condemnation of their parcel for a
retail center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rhonda Morford emerged from an hour of energized prayer and song in
the crowded auditorium of Cottonwood Christian Center on Sunday with
a clear vision about the controversy surrounding her church.</LD>
<LD>   "This is good versus evil," she said. "It is black and white.
There is no gray here.... Satan is trying to stop our new church from
being built."</LD>
<LD>   To Morford and many fellow congregants, Satan has taken the shape
of a Cypress City Council vote to condemn 18 acres where Cottonwood
plans to build a "megachurch," so a sales-tax-revenue-generating
Costco or other retail store can be built there.</LD>
<TE>   But it's not just the 4,000-member congregation and its religious
allies who are urging the city to find another place for a new
shopping district. A backlash against the City Council is brewing
from the very Cypress taxpayers whom the Costco is supposed to
benefit with more than $700,000 a year projected in sales tax
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Some say they are embarrassed by the national attention--and
ridicule--the city's move to condemn the church-owned land has
attracted.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Racine said it's a constant source of chatter among the
customers he sees as an employee of Mervyn's on Valley View Street.
"People keep saying this just isn't fair, and they want the City
Council voted out," he said. "They think it's flat-out the church's
land. There is already a Costco 15 minutes away, for crying out
loud."</TE>
<TE>   Melanie Cleveland is hearing the same thing from those who come
into the Petco where she works across the street. "I'm talking to a
lot of people who say they just don't think it is right," she said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials show no sign of backing down. They claim they are
the victims of an orchestrated public-relations campaign intended to
mislead residents about the facts of the case.</TE>
<TE>   To City Council members, it is simple: The land has been part of a
redevelopment zone since 1990, they say, and Cottonwood was warned
before buying a prime parcel at Walker Street and Katella Avenue that
a large church was not compatible with the city's vision.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials deny a warning was ever made.</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric has become heated. A mailing from an Oklahoma group
in support of Cottonwood depicted the City Council as mean, greedy
and immoral. Hundreds of Cottonwood members have dutifully appeared
to picket, chant and pray repeatedly in front of the council
chambers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a drawn-out battle," said Larry Matteson, a pastor at
Cottonwood.</TE>
<TE>   While the church's efforts have swayed some in Cypress, others
find the tone of it all quite offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone comes on that strong, it sends a signal to me that I
need to take it all with a grain of salt," said Cherie Dickey, 47, of
Cypress. "I have strong doubts about the believability of it all."</TE>
<TE>   Still others say they don't know what to think.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially, we felt the property should not be taken away," said
Fritz Friederich, 73, who was out grocery shopping with his wife,
Nancy. "Now we are just confused."</TE>
<TE>   City officials have produced a letter they sent to the church a
few months before the property was purchased in 1999, warning that
the property was in a planned business district. But the letter also
says the area could be rezoned through an amendment to accommodate a
church.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders promise they will see the struggle through.
Cottonwood has outgrown its 36,000-square-foot facility in Los
Alamitos; it holds six services a week to accommodate thousands of
members. The 700-seat auditorium fills up quickly, and hundreds of
congregants must watch weekend services on closed-circuit TV in
overflow rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed facility in Cypress is nearly nine times as large as
the church's current building and would include an auditorium,
gymnasium, classrooms, day-care center and other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   At the church Sunday, congregants were further invigorated by a
videotaped statement about the property's condemnation from their
leader, Senior Pastor Bayless Conley, who was in Mexico for the
weekend. "We need to keep trusting God," he said from the video
screen. "Things are going to work out."</TE>
<TE>   That's all many congregants said they needed to hear as they
shuffled out of the auditorium, into the jammed parking lot and onto
shuttle buses to their vehicles parked at a middle school.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a test of our faith," said Cottonwood member Shirley
Taylor, 29. "We will stand together until the end."</TE>

<HD>DUI Suspect Injures 4 in Crash</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Police say open containers are found in truck of
driver who had license restored Friday.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just two days after having his license reinstated following a
drunk-driving conviction, a 20-year-old man suspected of being drunk
ran a red light and struck another vehicle in Mission Viejo early
Sunday, injuring himself and four other people, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Though Mark Staffon is underage, his alcohol level was well over
the legal limit, said Lt. Larry Abbott of the Orange County Sheriff's
Department. Open alcohol containers were found in his red Chevy
pickup, Abbott said.</LD>
<LD>   Staffon's previous DUI arrest was Nov. 3, 1999, in southern Orange
County, Sheriff's Lt. Greg Russell said. His license was suspended
Nov. 6, 2000. He regained it Friday, deputies said. Russell did not
have details.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators said Staffon was traveling east on Crown Valley
Parkway around 12:45 a.m. when he ran the red light and crashed
broadside into a white 2001 Pontiac Sunbird convertible driven by
Joshua Rogal, 18, of Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Rogal had two friends in his car, one of them Angela Bailey, 18,
who had been ill earlier in the evening and had just been treated and
released from the emergency room at Mission Hospital Regional Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   The crash happened just one-eighth of a mile from the hospital as
Rogal was turning left from Medical Center Drive onto Crown Valley,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogal was in critical condition late Sunday with head injuries and
lung contusions. Jonathan Conder, 21, of Mission Viejo, who had been
in the back seat of the convertible, was in critical condition with
bleeding on the brain and multiple fractures and contusions.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey, 18, also of Mission Viejo, was in the front seat. She was
in stable condition with a fractured left leg and back pain.</TE>
<TE>   Staffon was admitted to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana with
facial cuts and body aches, officials said. A 17-year-old passenger
in his truck suffered minor injuries. Reached in the hospital Sunday
night, Staffon would not comment on the incident.</TE>

<LD>Fueled by steady winds and thick brush, a wildfire continued to burn
out of control on the steep hillsides north of Ojai on Sunday,
charring more than 2,500 acres and destroying several abandoned
buildings, including three old cabins, a garage and a shed, before
continuing east across rugged terrain.</LD>
<LD>   By late Sunday afternoon, the fire had blackened a wide swath of
rolling hills and steep canyons on both sides of California 33 about
12 miles north of Ojai in the Los Padres National Forest, said Kathy
Good, a U.S. Department of Forestry spokeswoman. The blaze was only
5% contained by late Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Good said that the cause remained unknown Sunday but that the
blaze was ignited at the Pine Mountain Inn off the state highway
about 3 p.m. Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a wildfire in the San Bernardino National Forest was
60% contained on Sunday but had grown slightly to 2,650 acres.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 firefighters battling the blaze are expected to
have it fully contained by 6 p.m. Friday, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Padres National Forest, officials said, warm weather
and gusting winds gave the wildfire new strength throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   Two campgrounds near the fire were evacuated Saturday, and
authorities asked campers and hikers in the popular Rose Valley
recreation area east of the blaze to leave the area Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   More than 914 firefighters battled the fire on the ground and in
the sky Sunday, Good said. Five air tankers and three helicopters
were dropping water and chemicals on the blaze, which burned through
an area that has been untouched by brush fires for nearly 70 years,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Crews from the U.S. Forest Service, the Ventura County Fire
Department and the state Department of Forestry were called in to
fight the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures climbed into the mid-80s and a steady 20 mph wind
fanned flames and carried hot embers that ignited additional fires.</TE>
<TE>   One of those set an abandoned wood garage on Felt Ranch ablaze
about noon Sunday, Good said. The structure, one of five on the
property, quickly burned to the ground, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire in the San Bernardino National Forest is about a mile
south of California 18. One firefighter injured a knee and two others
suffered heat exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze singed the Arrowhead Springs resort, a 1930s hotel now
used by a theology school. Flames damaged five outbuildings.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze broke out Friday after the state forestry department
conducted a firefighter training burn.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Deadly Chase to Recover</HD>
<DH>Pursuit: Police have not been able to talk to the
critically injured man, so he has not been booked.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who prompted a high-speed chase through downtown Los Angeles
that left a 4-year-old pedestrian dead is recovering from critical
injuries suffered in the collision, police said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said that because they have not been able to talk to the
man, he has not been booked on any charges. As a result, police
declined to release any information on the driver, including his
name.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't do that until he's formally been arrested," said Officer
Don Cox, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Police also declined to release additional details on the accident
Saturday that took the life of Evelyn Vargas, who was crushed by a
traffic signal knocked over at 6th and Spring streets.</TE>
<TE>   The chase began about 11:30 a.m. at 5th and Wall streets after a
BMW, reported stolen from the Hollywood area, refused to pull over
for officers. The four-minute chase wound through downtown until the
driver ran a red light and struck a minivan, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The impact jolted the minivan onto the sidewalk, slamming into a
traffic signal, which fell on Evelyn, who had been walking with her
mother, police said. The girl died at the scene of her injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Vargas later told a Spanish radio station that he last saw
his daughter before he left for work Saturday morning. "I kissed my
daughter before leaving the house while she was still asleep," he
said. "Who would have known that that would be the last time I would
see my daughter alive?"</TE>
<TE>   Police officials, who have come under criticism in recent months
for conducting high-speed chases in highly populated areas, said
information was not available Sunday on how fast the suspect and
pursuing officers were traveling.</TE>
<TE>   They also declined to release the names of the injured man and
woman in the minivan.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the critically injured suspect will likely be charged
in Evelyn's death.</TE>
<TE>   "When she died, this became a homicide investigation," Cox said.
"He will be booked for homicide."</TE>

<HD>Did Young Richard Nixon Romp Here?</HD>
<DH>House: Preservationists want to save Yorba Linda bungalow,
but no one's certain of its significance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few blocks from the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace sits an old,
wooden house with chipped paint and broken windows, a slightly
worse-for-wear mystery from another era.</LD>
<LD>   Local lore has it that as a child, Nixon romped in the grassy yard
outside the Yorba Linda home. The story goes that a second cousin,
author Jessamyn West, lived in the house for a while and baby-sat
Nixon when he was just a tot.</LD>
<LD>   Others say there is no proof that Nixon, or even West, spent any
time at the house. All of which leaves the two-story bungalow at a
curious crossroads. Its owner wants to rip the place down and replace
it with a larger, more modern building. A historical-preservation
group wants the home preserved, believing it echoes an important
chapter in Yorba Linda's history.</LD>
<TE>   City officials and even staff members at the Nixon library say the
debate has them stumped.</TE>
<TE>   Library officials say they don't know whether the former president
spent any time at the house. City officials are looking through
enrollment records at two local colleges to see whether West, a
novelist and short story writer who died in 1984, ever lived there.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been difficult to ascertain what relationship the house
had to the West family," said Joe Dmohowski, a collections librarian
at Whittier College who has studied Nixon and West since 1985. "It is
even more difficult to identify ties to the Nixon family."</TE>
<TE>   The house, built about 90 years ago, is a handsome wood-frame
bungalow, though in need of some repair. Its owners, Kent and Cathie
Brush, want to build in its place a new house--a mansion, some
neighbors complain. The city has put their plans on hold, deciding to
study the importance of the house before issuing a permit for it to
be razed.</TE>
<TE>   Twice before, the Brushes got permission to renovate their home,
each time letting the permits lapse without doing any construction.
The couple declined to weigh in on the current debate.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy and Ed Rakochy, who live across the street, said they want
not only to see the house preserved, but also to have the
neighborhood declared a historic district, serving as a gateway
between their community and the nearby Nixon library. Rakochy and his
wife have refurbished their Craftsman-style house, keeping the
original wood and brick.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot put a price on that home," Ed Rakochy said of the
Brushes' house. "No matter what condition it's in, you can't replace
it."</TE>
<TE>   Along with other supporters, Rakochy and his wife have formed the
Yorba Linda Historical Conservancy. The group monitors changes in the
neighborhood and tries to prevent other residents from altering their
homes in ways that divert from their original design.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want this neighborhood to become a mish-mash," Wendy
Rakochy said. "I see the future of this neighborhood [as] the crown
jewel of Yorba Linda."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Park Place house should be saved in the name of
Richard Nixon or Jessamyn West is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Nixon lived in the neighborhood as a child. And at some
point--probably her college years--so did West. There's a park
adjacent to the neighborhood named for her.</TE>
<TE>   As a girl in the early 1900s, West moved to then-rural Yorba
Linda, where her family had an orchard, according to biographical
material. She attended Fullerton College and later graduated from
Whittier College, as did Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest link connecting West to the home came in 1979, when
the Yorba Linda Star published a story tracing the writer of
"Friendly Persuasion" to the address.</TE>
<TE>   West responded with a letter to the editor saying that after
looking at the photograph that accompanied the article, she believed
it was the house where she lived during her college years.</TE>
<TE>   But Dmohowski said his research shows that while West mentions
baby-sitting Nixon in her writings and in speeches--sometimes
exalting in their shared Yorba Linda roots--she never specified the
Park Place house. In fact, several other houses have been linked to
the West family in Yorba Linda, including one that was once down the
street from the Brushes'. It was demolished decades ago, and Don
Bigonger, 44, now lives at the site in a modern stucco home.</TE>
<TE>   Bigonger said he suspects that all the talk about history is a
ploy to stop redevelopment in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to have [their own home declared] historical, I have
no problems with it," he said about the Rakochys' renovated
Craftsman. "But they should not include the whole neighborhood in
their plans."</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Haley, Yorba Linda's community development director, said
it will probably be three months before the city finishes its probe
into the lineage of the house. When complete, the findings will be
presented to the City Council, which will determine whether the
Brushes should be allowed to knock the place down.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Leaders Make Powerful Plea for Funds for Victims in
Israel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 350 Jews who gathered Sunday at a North Hollywood temple were
urged in a series of passionate speeches to provide Israel with moral
and financial support and to speak out about the violence in the
Jewish homeland.</LD>
<LD>   The noon rally at Adat Ari El was part of a broad fund-raising
campaign by the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, which hopes
to collect $10 million in aid for Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The funds will support grief counseling and trauma centers, as
well as provide financial assistance to victims of terror and their
families.</LD>
<TE>   Rabbi Moshe Rothblum said that Jews should not "ease up on talking
about the situation in Israel" because it reminds him of the late
1930s, when American politicians told politically connected rabbis
not to worry, and that the situation in Germany would be handled.</TE>
<TE>   "In the everlasting guilt of American Jewry, that view prevailed
and we were silenced," said Rothblum, the spiritual leader of the
Conservative congregation. "American Jewry will not be silenced
again."</TE>
<TE>   Geula Brodutch, director of Tel Aviv's information center for
senior services, told how part of her job includes helping to arrange
funeral services for victims of terrorism. Brodutch spoke of a young
couple who were killed in a Palestinian attack before their wedding
day. The woman's mother carried her daughter's wedding dress to the
funeral and the man and woman were buried beside each other.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, it's dangerous to just walk in the streets, to use the
bus, to sit in the cafes," Brodutch said.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Larry Miller made the financial pitch, saying Israeli Jews
need bulletproof vests, blood and ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   "Your job is to talk to your friends and say, 'You're not my
friend anymore if you're not involved trying to save your people.'"
said Miller, who played the hairdresser in "The Princess Diaries."
"Do you want to meet God and say, 'I was scared?'</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to meet God and say, 'I put tiles in the pool that
summer, so I couldn't give any money'?"</TE>
<TE>   As members of the congregation filled out pledge cards, Miller
urged people to give 10 times more than they initially considered
giving. A tally of the donations made Sunday was unavailable.</TE>

<DH>Recovery: A 1970s starlet who has lived on skid row is
getting her life together again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She arrived by public bus, not by limousine.</LD>
<LD>   Still, her return to Paramount Studios could not have been more
glorious to June Fairchild.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm in heaven," the 1970s starlet said after she stepped from the
No. 10 bus and walked onto the Melrose Avenue movie lot.</LD>
<TE>   Fairchild was at the studio to sign a merchandising contract that
will allow the manufacture of movie souvenirs tied to her role in the
1978 Cheech and Chong cult favorite "Up in Smoke."</TE>
<TE>   It had been a long, difficult journey back to the limelight for
the homeless, 55-year-old former actress--one made possible by
friends she never knew she had.</TE>
<TE>   After appearing in "Up in Smoke" as the "Ajax Lady," a befuddled
character who sniffed cleanser instead of cocaine, Fairchild
disappeared into her own chemical-induced puff of smoke.</TE>
<TE>   She started out by partying and dabbling with drugs, and soon was
drinking heavily. There were two failed marriages and a series of
abusive relationships. She was subsisting on general relief payments
by the end of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   By then she was homeless. She slept in skid row hotels, shelters
and--when things got really tough--beneath borrowed blankets inside
cardboard boxes on filthy downtown Los Angeles streets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From a Life of Glamour to One of Pain, Trauma</TE>
<TE>   It was a far cry from the days when she had roles in a dozen
films, appearing alongside Beau Bridges, Clint Eastwood, Rock Hudson
and Jack Nicholson.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a promising drama career, Fairchild's life was one of
pain and trauma.</TE>
<TE>   She was assaulted on skid row and had tried several unsuccessful
stints in rehabilitation centers by 2001, when The Times found her
trying to sell enough newspapers outside the downtown courthouse to
pay for a $28-per-night hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent story that February chronicled her struggles and
prompted dozens of offers of help. It also got Fairchild arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Police who recognized her from her photograph in the paper picked
her up on a charge of having alcohol in an open container.</TE>
<TE>   Records showed she had not successfully completed probation from a
previous drunk-driving conviction, so she was sentenced to 90 days in
jail.</TE>
<TE>   The two news articles marked a turning point in her life,
Fairchild said.</TE>
<TE>   "It told me, 'Let's stop horsing around, let's get it together.'
If you can't get it together at a shelter or on the street, maybe
jail is best," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A friend from the 1960s, Leon Blinka, made arrangements for
Fairchild to serve out the final portion of her sentence under house
arrest at his Silver Lake home.</TE>
<TE>   Other Times readers helped too.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity photographer Greg Gorman updated Fairchild's portfolio
with new glamour and head shots. Film producer Lou Adler paid for
driving lessons she needed to get her license reinstated. State Sen.
Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) met with her and was persuaded to
seek funding for a woman's dorm at a downtown shelter where she had
once stayed. Cable TV show host Alan Ray escorted her to the premiere
of the movie "Legally Blonde." A gown and a makeup session were
donated for the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Classmates from the old Aviation High School in Redondo Beach,
where Fairchild graduated in the mid-1960s, donated clothes and cash
and invited her to a school reunion last summer in Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had this urge to protect her like my child," said Gail
Barr, a high school friend who tracked down the former actress.</TE>
<TE>   But the struggle continued. Fairchild joined Alcoholics Anonymous.
She fought to reconnect with her 16-year-old daughter, who lives with
friends in Santa Monica. She bounced from one temporary living
arrangement to another.</TE>
<TE>   All along, Fairchild clung to her dream of a return to acting. In
a way, she explained, her talent had served her even on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "You can act your way into safety. I've done that when it's dark.
You better do something smart to save yourself," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to work. I have my Screen Actors Guild card--it's current.
l'm going to be self-sufficient. I'm going to take care of my
daughter. I want to get a little house and do it right. I'm not
thinking small."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to Get Back in Front of the Camera</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Fairchild was delighted when a letter from Paramount
Studios was delivered to a friend's house where Fairchild collects
her mail. It wasn't a job offer, but it was close.</TE>
<TE>   Another 12-step participant, writer Michael Casey, accompanied
Fairchild on the bus to the studio to sign the marketing contract.</TE>
<TE>   "She's back to work after 15 years," Casey said softly after
walking through the Paramount gates.</TE>
<TE>   Outside companies want to do additional action figures, T-shirts,
bobbing-head dolls and the like for fans of Cheech and Chong films,
said Kirsti Payne, director of product development for Viacom
Consumer Products, Paramount's licensing division. People have
requested the Ajax Lady character, Payne said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll get 5%? Two-and-one-half percent? I don't care," Fairchild
told Payne. "I'm in heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Glancing around at the movie posters decorating the studio office
walls as she started to leave, Fairchild spoke of finding an agent
and getting back in front of the camera.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to play a bag lady. Not that I've ever been one. But
I've observed them," she said. "I'm never late. I know my lines. I'm
a bankable girl."</TE>
<TE>   Before getting back on the bus, Fairchild explained that she would
soon be moving from a San Fernando Valley apartment to a place in
Venice.</TE>
<TE>   At week's end, those plans had changed. Venice was out--it was too
expensive for a person still relying on general relief and the
generosity of friends.</TE>
<TE>   Fairchild spent two nights in a Valley motel before landing,
temporarily, at the home of a friend. "I probably won't make much
money from the products," she said of the marketing deal. "But that's
OK. I'll do fine."</TE>
<TE>   She'll bounce back, she promised.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the ultimate show business comeback.</TE>

<HD>Flora Lewis, 79; Foreign Correspondent, Expert on Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Flora Lewis, an American journalist and columnist whose probing
analysis of international affairs appeared in newspapers for nearly
six decades, died Sunday. She was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis died of cancer at her home in Paris, according to the New
York Times, one of several papers for which she worked.</LD>
<LD>   Her other media outlets included Associated Press, the Washington
Post and International Herald Tribune.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis, who was born in Los Angeles, was admired for her deep
understanding of European affairs and her sense of the continuity of
European history.</TE>
<TE>   She moved to Europe at the end of World War II and spent most of
her life abroad, covering the Cold War, the fall of the Iron Curtain
and European reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   She also ventured farther afield for articles on the Middle East
conflict and the Vietnam war. Colleagues said she had a knack for
noticing small, revealing details and then piecing them together into
the big picture.</TE>
<TE>   She was known for her bright blue eyes, her no-nonsense demeanor
and her ability to talk comfortably with anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis continued writing articles for the New York Times Syndicate
and the International Herald Tribune until a few months ago, though
she was ill.</TE>
<TE>   "As she got older she was tough, in the best sense of the word,
and she didn't take any nonsense," said Jonathan Randal, a former
Washington Post correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very courageous about her disease, and she just basically
ignored it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was born in 1922, and studied at UCLA and at Columbia
University's journalism school in New York.</TE>
<TE>   She started her career at Associated Press in New York and went to
London for the agency after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   She married Sydney Gruson, who worked for the New York Times, and
the two traveled the world together until they divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a policy that barred married couples from working for
the paper, Lewis wasn't able to write for the New York Times until
after her divorce in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis wrote five books, including "Europe: Road To Unity" and
"Europe: A Tapestry of Nations."</TE>
<TE>   France named Lewis a Knight of the Legion of Honor, and in 1999
she won a lifetime achievement award from the Overseas Press Club of
America.</TE>
<TE>   The group said her "determination, stamina and courage stand as a
model to all journalists who would seek foreign postings."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is survived by a son, Lindsey, and a daughter, Kerry.
Another daughter, Sheila, died in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Ed Cesar, 55; Pilot, Champion Hang Glider Took Part in Film
'Up'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Cesar, 55, a champion hang glider pilot who with his wife,
Barbara, founded Syncro Aircraft Interiors, died May 24 in Los
Angeles. The cause of death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Born Edison Martin Cesar, he repeatedly won hang-gliding
competitions and piloted a glider for the camera in the inspirational
documentary "Up." The film won an Academy Award and a National
Educational Award, and has been used to inspire children to set high
goals for themselves.</LD>
<LD>   An accomplished pilot, Cesar had ratings to teach flying and to
fly helicopters, jet and seaplanes as well as gliders. He flew more
than 13,000 hours and, with his wife, flew relief missions in their
floatplane to aid Nicaragua and Honduras after Hurricane Mitch in
1998.</LD>
<TE>   With their business, the Cesars designed and built posh interiors
of planes owned by celebrities and others. Always connected to
Hollywood, Cesar sublet part of his hangar space at Van Nuys Airport
to film companies for work on such motion pictures as "Batman and
Robin," "True Lies" and "Air Force One."</TE>

<HD>Francis Takemoto, 89; First Japanese American Promoted to
General</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Francis Shigeo Takemoto, 89, a decorated World War II infantry
officer who later, while serving in the Hawaiian National Guard,
became the first Japanese American to reach the rank of brigadier
general, died May 26 in Honolulu. Takemoto died in his sleep,
apparently of causes related to aging.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Honolulu to Japanese immigrant parents, Takemoto graduated
from the University of Hawaii, where he was commissioned a 2nd
lieutenant through the Reserve Officer Training Program in 1935.</LD>
<LD>   He added a teaching degree from UC Santa Barbara and taught
mathematics until he was called to active duty when the U.S. entered
World War II.</LD>
<TE>   Takemoto fought with the 100th Infantry Battalion of the famed
442nd "Go for Broke" regiment in Anzio, Italy. Wounded in the head by
shrapnel, he earned a Purple Heart, four battle stars, the Victory
medal and a Presidential Citation with cluster.</TE>
<TE>   At war's end, Takemoto returned to teaching and later became an
elementary school principal in Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   But he also joined the Hawaiian National Guard, helped reorganize
it, and rose in the ranks. In 1964, he made history when Hawaii Gov.
John A. Burns pinned the stars of a brigadier general on his uniform.</TE>
<TE>   He will be buried June 11 at the National Cemetery of the Pacific
in Oahu's Punchbowl, with a 21-gun salute, but by his preference,
without the cannon salute normally accorded a general.</TE>

<HD>Big Gun Hired for Analysis of Visitors Bureau</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alarmed by big bills for limousines, four-star hotel suites and
gourmet dinners, City Controller Laura Chick has hired a big gun to
analyze spending at the L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau.</LD>
<LD>   Chick has retained former state Auditor Kurt Sjoberg to go through
the bureau's books to see whether the city's money is being spent
properly. Los Angeles pays the bureau up to $18 million a year to
promote tourism and line up conventions.</LD>
<LD>   The Times has reported in recent weeks that bonuses were paid to
bureau salespeople for booking conventions that later canceled, and
that bureau bigwigs spent thousands of city tax dollars taking VIPs
to a Wimbledon tennis match and dinner at Kensington Palace.</LD>
<TE>   "The reports have been troubling--renting a hall at Kensington
Palace, half a million dollars for limousines," Chick said. "The
taxpayers need to know if their dollars are being spent wisely and
effectively and what they are getting in return."</TE>
<TE>   Sjoberg was the state's top auditor from 1989 to 2000, after which
he went into private practice. His company will be paid $67,300 for
the audit.</TE>

<TE>   Assembly Speaker Takes Advantage of His Perks</TE>
<TE>   While legislators in Sacramento struggle to close a $23.6-billion
hole in the state budget, spending on perks has continued unabated.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Herb Wesson of Culver City was sworn in as Assembly
speaker, the order went out for two new Buick Park Avenues, each
costing about $40,000. One of the vehicles is for driving Wesson
around Los Angeles and the other for travels around Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Each comes with a state sergeant-at-arms as a chauffer and a full
array of security gear, including a CHP radio and flashing police
lights, said Jon Waldie, chief administrative officer of the Assembly
Rules Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "They are both there to use for business in Los Angeles and
Sacramento," Waldie said.</TE>
<TE>   For personal trips, Wesson also has a $40,000 Cadillac Seville
mostly paid for from his $400-per-month auto allowance as a
legislator. A spokesperson for Wesson said the vehicles are necessary
for him to do his job, and noted that previous speakers also have had
multiple cars at their disposal.</TE>

<TE>   Pagans Retract Offer to Libertarian Candidate</TE>
<TE>   You know your campaign is in trouble when the pagans won't let you
speak.</TE>
<TE>   While participating in the Snake Parade in Berkeley in March,
Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Gary Copeland was asked by
organizers to speak at Pagan Pride Day on Sept. 14 in San Francisco.
They later retracted the invitation, explaining that the event is run
as a nonprofit corporation. By promoting political campaigns, it
would risk losing its tax-free status.</TE>
<TE>   "Rejected even by pagans," said Copeland, a self-labeled Druid
existentialist who lives in Trabuco Canyon. "It is amazing how free
speech can be controlled by government."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Lists On-Camera Etiquette</TE>
<TE>   He's known as the biggest ham among Ventura County politicians.
And Supervisor John Flynn of Oxnard didn't disappoint as he and other
supervisors recently discussed transmitting the board's Tuesday
morning meetings live on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   With a vaudevillian flourish, Flynn unfurled a sheet of paper and
asked his colleagues to prepare for the digital debut by following
his rules for behavior:</TE>
<TE>   5. There will be no swearing.</TE>
<TE>   4. Board members will not be disagreeable.</TE>
<TE>   3. Board members will always smile and be cool.</TE>
<TE>   2. Board members will wear makeup.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn's No. 1 rule? Be careful where you scratch.</TE>
<TE>   The tart-tongued Flynn admits he probably will be the first to
break decorum. "I'm getting better. I keep a card in front of me that
says, 'Stay cool,'" he said. "I'll just have to let loose with it
when I go in the back room."</TE>

<TE>   Hahn, Soboroff Finish Rematch in a Dead Heat</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Mayor James K. Hahn hasn't seen much of his mayoral rival
since he took office last July. So when he got together Wednesday
with Steve Soboroff to tout an electric car program at Playa
Vista--the Westside development Soboroff is running--the former
candidate decided to have some fun with the man who beat him.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a race about a year ago and you cleaned my clock then,"
Soboroff told Hahn. "We're going to have a race again here, and this
time I want it to be a tie."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor accepted the challenge, and the two men hopped behind
the wheels of two electric cars the size of golf carts and took a
spin around the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was ahead for most of the course, but Soboroff pulled even as
they reached the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   "Dead heat," Soboroff declared, as they clambered out and shook
hands. "You play fair."</TE>

<TE>   Congressman Stumped by Mystery Vegetable</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Christopher Cox is the kind of guy who reads D'Tocqueville
for fun.</TE>
<TE>   So a group of second-graders witnessed a rare moment when the
Newport Beach Republican was stumped by a word in a book he was
reading to the class about giant vegetables falling from the sky.</TE>
<TE>   The word: arugula. "I've come across a vegetable I don't know,"
Cox said (pronouncing it air-a-gula instead of a-roog-ula).</TE>
<TE>   The leafy green vegetable, which is from the mustard family and
has a slightly peppery taste, stumped the teacher, too. She guessed
that it was the sweet, sliced white vegetable that's great with
dips--also known as jicama.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Democratic state Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento) was not
amused last week when Republican Sen. Ray Haynes of Riverside
criticized her leadership of a budget subcommittee that handles
health issues. Problem is he confused Ortiz, who does not chair the
committee, with former state Sen. Hilda Solis (D-El Monte), who had
previously chaired the panel. "I was close," Haynes said, noting the
philosophical similarities between Ortiz and Solis.</TE>
<TE>   * Angelenos can rest easy knowing the city's FOG (Fats, Oils and
Grease) Control program is working. Fats and grease from restaurants
caused 28% fewer sewer system clogs and overflows during the last
quarter, city officials proclaimed this week in a news release. Does
that mean L.A. is eating more healthfully?</TE>
<TE>   * Holy mackerel! Gov. Gray Davis has hooked the endorsement of the
Fishermen's Union of America, AFL-CIO, according to a campaign news
release. Davis gushed that he was "grateful to have earned the
support of the Fishermen," making them sound more rock 'n' roll than
rock cod. No word on whether Davis will get support from fisherwomen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "You should all know how that name is spelled in this building."</TE>
<TE>   --Los Angeles City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, responding to a
request by a court reporter to spell her name before testifying at a
secession hearing in the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration, which
is named after her father.</TE>

<TE>   Graduation Giggles</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn shares a laugh with high school seniors from
the Los Angeles Police Academy's magnet schools as they stand for
inspection during graduation Thursday. Seniors received their
diplomas from the program, which was created in 1996 by the Los
Angeles Unified School District, the LAPD and 21st Century Insurance
to develop quality future law enforcement officers.</TE>

<HD>More Razor Blades Put in O.C. Park</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>More than 30 razor blades were discovered in a Mission Viejo park
playground Sunday morning, marking the ninth time in a month that
sharp objects have been found in south Orange County parks.</LD>
<LD>   A woman on her way to a softball tournament in Alicia Park noticed
four razor blades near a slide on the playground.</LD>
<LD>   When sheriff's deputies combed the park with metal detectors, they
found an additional 28 razor blades in the area, according to Jim
Amormino, a Sheriff's Department spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   "They were right by the stairs of the slide," Amormino said. "It's
a very small playground area, and 32 is a lot of razor blades. I'm
sure they had the intent to harm children."</TE>
<TE>   The discovery was the latest in a string of incidents across
Orange County in which razor blades and nails have turned up in
parks.</TE>
<TE>   The first razor-blade discovery was in a Laguna Beach park in
April. No injuries have been reported. "We're taking several security
measures," Amormino said. "I'm confident we'll find them. Luckily, no
one was hurt again."</TE>
<TE>   Nails and razor blades have been found at six parks in Mission
Viejo in the last month. There are 46 city parks in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what makes this so difficult," Amormino said. "There are
so many parks to watch."</TE>
<TE>   A wave of razor blade discoveries occurred more than a year ago at
six parks in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Police never caught the culprit or culprits, and the crimes
apparently ended in May 2001.</TE>

<LD>The route for the Suzuki Rock 'n' Roll Marathon had to be altered
Sunday after a naked man driving a sport-utility vehicle ran over and
dragged a police officer while running a roadblock set up for the
marathon, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Several officers fired at the driver, who was then dragged from
his vehicle. The incident occurred at 5:30 a.m. along the route of
the marathon, which attracted more than 20,000 runners.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the officer nor the driver suffered major injuries,
officials said. The marathon route was changed so that officers could
examine the shooting scene.</LD>

<HD>100 Left Homeless in Residential Hotel Fire</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least 100 people were left homeless early Sunday after a fire
ripped through a residential hotel.</LD>
<LD>   No one was seriously hurt in the blaze, but 25 to 30 residents had
to be rescued from fire escapes and the roof. Three people suffered
minor smoke inhalation and were taken to San Francisco General
Hospital, said San Francisco Fire Capt. Pete Howes.</LD>
<LD>   Fire officials were unsure what caused the three-alarm fire at the
Baldwin Hotel just before 4 a.m. It started on a second-floor light
shaft of the 200-room hotel and then spread to the roof and attic,
Howes said.</LD>
<TE>   The American Red Cross set up an emergency shelter for those who
were displaced. It was unknown when residents would be allowed to
return or how much damage was sustained, Howes said.</TE>

<HD>Sacramento Winces as L.A. Roars</HD>
<DH>Cities: Starved Kings fans go away hungry again, denied
sports respectability as Lakers triumph.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN, RONE TEMPEST and LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was like waiting for rain. Overdue in overtime.</LD>
<LD>   A town thirsty for bragging rights took on a city so awash in
transcendent sports moments it can afford to forget them. Sacramento
was left parched.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles had Jerry West, Kirk Gibson, Magic Johnson. Sacramento
had just the hand-me-down memories of other towns--Rochester or
Kansas City, the last places where their Kings were regal.</LD>
<TE>   And after an edge-of-your seat overtime win, L.A. won another
moment for its sports resume.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great feeling," said Veronica Romero, 29, of Pacoima as
she left Staples Center, where she had watched the game on television
screens. "You can't feel this when you're by yourself watching TV.
It's unity."</TE>
<TE>   If Los Angeles was fearful about falling from grace in Sunday's
do-or-die NBA Western Conference final, Sacramento was beside itself
to win something big and come out strutting with civic pride.
Instead, it skulked away to another year of bovine-themed derision.</TE>
<TE>   Over at the packed Marilyn's Bar in downtown Sacramento, the
thrill of the Kings' pushing the mighty Lakers into overtime
evaporated into deep depression in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to go out and celebrate," said one gloomy Kings fan.
"Now I feel like hanging myself."</TE>
<TE>   "This is all the town has," said Jason Brown, 28, an auto glass
company manager. "This is the town. This hurts all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the game, Sacramento fans were sick of the name L.A.
had given them: cow town.</TE>
<TE>   "They call us a cow town, but we are part of the California that
feeds the world," said a peeved Capt. John Golder, pilot of the
Spirit of Sacramento paddle-wheel steamboat that ferried tourists
along the Sacramento River.</TE>
<TE>   Golder's packed pregame sightseeing cruise was festooned with
Kings flags and rabid Sacramento fans screaming "Beat L.A." as the
vessel passed the upriver restaurants. Cowbells may be fine for some,
but not Golder, who casually let a robust blast rip from the
air-diaphragm boat whistle to show his support.</TE>
<TE>   At game time, only a few cars traveled on even the busiest
streets. Parked cars on residential streets were decorated with
anti-Laker graffiti. During breaks, neighbors wobbled between houses,
drinks in nervous hands.</TE>
<TE>   Not one of California's legislators toiled Sunday at the state
Capitol while security guards attempted unsuccessfully to jerry-rig a
TV connection. Already, the cowbells were clanging down at Arco
Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour into the game, and just minutes before the 5p.m. Mass
at Sacramento's Our Lady of Blessed Sacrament Cathedral, Father James
Murphy burst out the doors of the rectory. "I was just watching right
now. The Kings are ahead by one point and I have to say Mass. It just
kills me," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to do it in 30 minutes," about half the usual time for
a Mass, Murphy assured an anxious parishioner.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the one Sacramentan glad to be at work was Robert Dick, a
bounty hunter who was manning the desk at Atlas Bail Bonds, not far
from the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   For the bail bond business, Dick said, the Kings-Lakers series has
been a godsend. Relatives are easy to find to post bond, because most
are at home in front of television sets.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, Los Angeles was so deserted by residents
flocking indoor to television sets that a plane in distress had
little trouble finding a place to land on the San Bernardino Freeway
in Alhambra.</TE>
<TE>   Merchants at the usually bustling Los Angeles City College swap
meet tore down stalls as crowds thinned an hour ahead of game time.
"Everybody's racing out of here," said Daniel Luna, a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Those still packing up at game time listened from cars and
hand-held radios. Tony Ortiz struggled to fix the reception on his
dashboard-rigged, 9-inch television set so that his stepdaughter,
Pamela Zaldivar, 15, could watch the game on their way home to Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   With the screen still dark when Zaldivar returned from the
bathroom, Pamela fumed. "He better hit beyond 65 mph because we live
kind of far and I don't want to miss the second half," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Spurned by the fate of the finals, Staples Center was packed like
a home game, but with all the stars missing. And instead of staring
down at the court, fans stared up at screens.</TE>
<TE>   No cowbell ringing could be heard. "We have more class than that,"
assured Leimert Park resident Linda Young. But there was passion
enough in a town with a reputation for raising sports blase to a
virtue.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Lopez could hardly believe she was inside the Lakers'
cathedral, and for $10 at that. "That's why we can't sit down," said
the Rancho Cucamonga resident, who arrived with her husband, son and
daughter at 9 a.m., and scored seats in the second-to-last row in a
corner.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Jase, 50, sat in the pricey seats normally occupied by VIPs,
having snagged his courtside tickets for him and his fiance Saturday.
"We are Lakers Headquarters," Jase said just before jump ball. "Just
living in L.A. makes you have Laker Love," he said. "I like the
Clippers, but I love the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   It was all too much for Mir Mirrazeghi, who left his family inside
the thunderously loud arena to stand alone in front of a quiet
concession stand with a more modest screen, where he whooped as Kings
center Vlade Divac missed two consecutive free throws in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife and everybody is in there," the 46-year-old Diamond Bar
resident said, pointing to the arena, where video feeds cut out the
Arco crowd and beamed back the Staples scenes instead. "I can't focus
in there, because it's just too loud. I just want to watch."</TE>
<TE>   At half time, the Lakers down, a couple of men wearing yellow
spandex shorts and fake afros strutted out of the arena chanting,
"Keep the funk alive!" Watching the men's antics, Juan Alcantar, 28,
said basketball was one of the few things that could bring Los
Angeles residents of any stripe together. "You don't care who's
around you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dwayne Hearn, 41, a Los Angeles native living in San Jose, came to
watch at the Staples Center. "All you gotta do is look around," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the diversity of this crowd," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People always talk about Los Angeles, how there's no pride in the
city. What kind of event brings people of such diversity together?"</TE>
<TE>   It was a point that fell with nothing but net.</TE>

<HD>Dot-Coms' Bust Is a Boon to Classrooms</HD>
<DH>Education: Laid-off tech employees are rejoining work force
as public school teachers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tera Creech has cracked genetic coding as a researcher for a biotech
firm and taken apart software programs as a skilled technician for a
booming dot-com.</LD>
<LD>   But that's nothing compared to what she plans to do next: teach
high school science.</LD>
<LD>   Creech is one of about 200 laid-off technology workers in
California who are rejoining the work force as public school
teachers.</LD>
<TE>   With help from a $1.6-million state grant, they are bringing their
science degrees and high-tech backgrounds into a public school system
that is facing a severe shortage of qualified math and science
instructors.</TE>
<TE>   Creech, 25, a biology major from California Lutheran University in
Thousand Oaks, used to spend most of her days sitting in front of a
computer in an isolated cubicle. Her job was trouble-shooting
software programs.</TE>
<TE>   She was laid off from Camarillo-based eLabor.com in
September--along with about 90 other workers--just weeks before she
gave birth to her daughter, Abigail, now 7 months old.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, Creech will stand in front of 30 hormone-charged
teenagers and attempt to get them excited about biology and
chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   But she's confident she is up to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little bit nervous, but definitely excited," said Creech,
who also worked as a research assistant at biotechnology giant Amgen
Inc. "Part of the reason I went into science was because I had
teachers who made it fun and interesting. I want to open that world
to kids."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County and four government agencies in the Silicon Valley
were awarded grants from the state Employment Development Department
in March to create the Technology to Teacher program.</TE>
<TE>   Participants can apply for grant money to pay for tuition, books,
testing fees, counseling and other support services, said Suzanne
Schroeder, department spokeswoman. The program is run through local
job centers.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was for the incentives to make the difference for
displaced tech workers who otherwise would not choose to go into
teaching, particularly because the job pays at least $20,000 a year
less than most private-sector technology positions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has been an influence," said Amy Fonzo, who is
coordinating the effort in Ventura County. "Many of them were looking
for another technology position, and decided to go into teaching
instead."</TE>
<TE>   The largest chunk of the state money--$536,000--went to the North
Valley Job Training Center in Sunnyvale, which is the part of the
state hardest hit by the dot-com crash and tech-industry downsizing.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 people likely will take part in the program there, said
Director Mike Curran, including 25 who will start taking classes
toward a credential at San Jose State University later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Those students plan to get internship jobs at schools while they
complete their classes at night, Curran said.</TE>
<TE>   Amy DeMasi, a technical writer who was laid off last fall from
Santa Clara-based Applied Materials, is one of them. With a
bachelor's degree in geology and a master's in geochemistry, she
worked for five years as a technical consultant for the Environmental
Protection Agency's Superfund program.</TE>
<TE>   DeMasi moved to the Silicon Valley from northern Virginia two
years ago, for a job at Applied Materials that doubled her salary.</TE>
<TE>   But the whole time, she said, she felt her career lacked meaning.</TE>
<TE>   When she lost her job and heard about the state's new teacher
training program, she knew it was the right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "They need teachers here, and I really feel like my work
experience is very valuable," said DeMasi, who wants to teach
environmental science in an inner-city high school. "So many people
don't understand basic science to be able to do what's right for our
country."</TE>
<TE>   With thousands of teachers retiring each year and student
populations continuing to grow, K-12 schools across the state are
struggling to fill positions, particularly in specialty science
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Needs are greatest at middle schools and high schools in urban
areas, where percentages of poor and non-English speaking students
are highest, state education officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the state issued nearly 2,700 emergency permits for
science teachers, according to the California Commission on Teacher
Credentialing.</TE>
<TE>   That's about 20% of the entire science teacher work force, and is
the highest number of permits issued for any single subject, said
Marilyn Errett, a consultant with the commission.</TE>
<TE>   An emergency-permit teacher may only be hired if a credentialed
instructor cannot be found, Errett added.</TE>
<TE>   Creech, whose parents and husband are also teachers, said going
into the profession had crossed her mind before.</TE>
<TE>   But when she graduated from college, she said it was tough to
choose a lower-paying job with more hoops to jump through in
education over a higher-paying and seemingly easier job in business.</TE>
<TE>   "Becoming a teacher can be a very daunting process," Creech said.
"I probably would never have done it, and I think what this program
is doing is great."</TE>
<TE>   Creech will enroll in Cal State Northridge's credential program in
the fall, while also teaching in a public school classroom under an

<HD>Rivalry May Catch Up to Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It's tough to decide who needed a worthy adversary more--the NBA or
the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in two years, the league had a team that could
look the Lakers in the eye without blinking. The Sacramento Kings
brought out the best in the Lakers, pushed them to a level we weren't
sure they could reach. This seven-game series, which wasn't settled
until the Lakers prevailed in overtime Sunday, turned the quest for a
third consecutive championship from a bad buddy picture into an epic
equivalent of "The Lord of the Rings."</LD>
<LD>   And after three consecutive playoff meetings, Lakers-Kings can now
stand next to any current rivalry in sports.</LD>
<TE>   You're going to tell me you wouldn't watch these guys throw on the
sneakers and go at it another 10 times?</TE>
<TE>   All they need now is a little staying power. And it might actually
be easier for the Kings to hold up their end of the bargain than the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they're not going anywhere," Laker forward and King
tormentor Rick Fox said. "The Maloofs are going to keep that team
together, and rightfully so. We're not getting any younger. You look
at any rivalry across the ages, the two teams butt heads for a
stretch, one gets the best of the other and it kind of flip-flops
sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully this won't disappear as quickly as Lakers-Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Since that classic Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference finals
the paths of the Lakers and Trail Blazers have gone in completely
different directions, much like the careers of Tom Hanks and Peter
Scolari after "Bosom Buddies."</TE>
<TE>   Now Portland is nothing more than first-round sweep material for
the Lakers as they make their way to the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were feisty upstarts who forced the Lakers to a Game 5
in the first round in 2000, but proved unable to win on the road.
Last year they made it to the second round and then couldn't win
anywhere, as the Lakers swept them.</TE>
<TE>   This series, the Kings easily could have won all three games
played at Staples Center. They dominated Game 3, came within a Robert
Horry three-point basket in the last second of winning Game 4 and
hung in Game 6 until the last minute despite some seriously
home-cooked calls for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "They just showed a quality of poise and their ability to play
under duress a lot better than they had in the last two years against
us," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "They had it in a basketball
club. It wasn't just individually, it was floating between the
players."</TE>
<TE>   The last four games featured three games that came down to the
last seconds, then the first overtime game in conference finals
history. (And the Lakers' 112-106 victory was the first game in the
series in which the officiating crew--Dan Crawford, Bernie Fryer and
Eddie F. Rush-- deserved kudos instead of criticism. They let the
players play).</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers didn't just see the team that will knock them off
their throne, they at least got a look at the blueprint. The Kings
blended a little bit of the old with the new. Take the pick-and-roll
game that Utah used to perfection to win eight of nine playoff games
against the Lakers a few years ago. Add in a center who ranks among
the best of the non-Shaq crowd. Mix in scoring threats at every spot
on the floor and high-energy players off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Is the rivalry on?</TE>
<TE>   "Most definitely," said King guard Bobby Jackson, who was a spark
off the bench throughout the series. "You keep this nucleus together
... we sign Mike [Bibby, who's up for an extension], and that's the
only thing we've got to think about this summer, we sign him. I'm
definitely positive that he comes back."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings just haven't broken through.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess our time's got to come some other year," King Coach Rick
Adelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Rivalries bring out the best in the two teams. The more teams play
each other they become more alike, assimilating whatever
characteristics will enable them to win.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kings, they were playing excellent basketball," Kobe Bryant
said. "They were playing better basketball than we were. And yet we
managed to hang in there and keep on fighting and somehow win the
series. I think that shows a lot about our character.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a gut-check. To be tested like this, and to respond the
way we have, it gives us a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Rivals are like mirrors, which means they also show the flaws.
This series demonstrated the danger of the Lakers' reliance on Bryant
and Shaquille O'Neal. One reason the Lakers were so fearful of foul
trouble on either of those two was that they had no one on the bench
who could serve as a serviceable replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "You see how many minutes we logged as starters," said Fox, one of
four Laker starters to play 48 minutes or more in Game 7. "That's a
credit to their team, it's not a discredit to our guys. We have a
great bench, but Phil is obviously going to go with the guys that
have been here. And it paid off."</TE>
<TE>   There were times throughout the series when even the other
starters couldn't provide scoring threats to bolster O'Neal and
Bryant. Fox, Horry and Derek Fisher went long stretches without
creating their own offense, before they all made solid contributions
in the fourth quarter and overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Laker owner Jerry Buss is going to have to pay extra, probably
even going into luxury tax territory, to get his team the additional
punch it will need to hold the Kings back.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, he at least was in the mood to pay the Kings compliments.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel they're the next best team in the West," Buss said. "And
obviously it's very close between the two teams. I think that has to
create rivalry. They haven't beaten us in any serious playoff
situation, but on the other hand they gave us everything we could
possibly want this time."</TE>
<TE>   A real rivalry?</TE>
<TE>   "They gotta beat us first," Bryant said. "You know the rules,
baby."</TE>
<TE>   More reason for the Kings to anticipate their next shot at the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Can't wait till it gets here.</TE>

<HD>Agoos Finally Gets a Field Day</HD>
<DH>Soccer: After 14 years with U.S. national team, 34-year-old
is expected to play in World Cup for first time Wednesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The moment is almost here for Jeff Agoos. Unless disaster strikes in
the next 48 hours, on Wednesday the United States' oldest and
second-most experienced player will step onto the field for the first
time in a World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   It has taken him 14 years to get here.</LD>
<LD>   To put that in perspective, when Agoos, 34, first put on a U.S.
national team jersey, World Cup teammates Landon Donovan and DaMarcus
Beasley were 6 years old.</LD>
<TE>   To call Agoos the grand old man of U.S. soccer might be pushing it
a little, but if anyone deserves to play here, it's the San Jose
Earthquake and former D.C. United defender who has racked up more
than 10,000 minutes of playing time for the national team.</TE>
<TE>   And not one of those minutes was on soccer's grandest stage.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years ago, Agoos was the last player cut by then-coach Bora
Milutinovic before the USA '94 World Cup. He reacted by setting fire
to his training gear and reconsidering his future.</TE>
<TE>   "What did I burn? It was just a pair of shorts and a shirt, that
was it," he said Sunday. "It was nothing more symbolic than that."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Agoos was selected for the France '98 World Cup by
then-coach Steve Sampson but didn't see any playing time. Not one
second. While others lashed out at that 0-3 debacle, Agoos reacted by
biting his tongue and reconsidering his future.</TE>
<TE>   And in both instances that reconsideration led to the decision to
carry on, to keep plugging away until he had proven that he should
have been there all along.</TE>
<TE>   And now that he's here, poised to be a part of Korea/Japan '02,
the surprising thing is that he doesn't view it as a great
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at this as an individual thing where the spotlight's
on me," he said. "I think it's more important to focus on what my job
is within the team and how I'm going to go about accomplishing that.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe once the tournament's over I'll look at it in a different
light, but right now my focus is just on what my duties and
responsibilities are."</TE>
<TE>   But isn't there a sense of satisfaction to reach a goal he had set
when he made his U.S. debut, against Guatemala in 1988? Not so, said
Agoos.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't an issue for me whether I played or didn't play," he
said. "It wasn't that big of a deal. I've been in the national team
for 14 years now and if I am able to step on the field, then I think
that will be a great thing. If not, then I think I've still
contributed to the national team program. It's not a do-or-die
situation for me."</TE>
<TE>   It is a do-or-die situation for the U.S., which opens in Suwon,
South Korea, against a Portugal team that is viewed as one of the
tournament's strongest. Agoos' role is clearly defined, although it
remains uncertain whether he will play as a central defender or at
left back.</TE>
<TE>   "Simply put, it's to stop them from scoring goals," he said.
"Playing against any team, but especially Portugal, it's not a very
simple job. They've got such a wealth of talent that you've got to be
ready to do a number of things.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we've got an idea of how they're going to play, but when
it comes down to the day, everything could be different, so we just
have to do the problem solving on the field. They're a pretty
creative and talented bunch of players."</TE>
<TE>   Agoos has played 130 games for the U.S., a total second only to
Cobi Jones on the all-time list. He has a couple of Gold Cup
victories on his resume, along with a record four Major League Soccer
titles.</TE>
<TE>   "His greatest quality that he brings to our team is his
consistency," Coach Bruce Arena said Sunday. "Wherever we've played
him, he's been pretty consistent throughout the years .He brings a
lot of quality to the field and certainly some experience as well
with our group. So I'm hopeful that this is a good World Cup for
Jeff."</TE>
<TE>   It was because Arena took over as coach in 1998 that Agoos decided
to stay with the national team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big factor for coming back and trying for another four
years," he said. "I have a long history with Bruce all the way to
[the University of] Virginia and I knew what kind of coach he was,
what kind of person he was, his expectations, and I knew I could fit
that role whether it was on or off the field."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before leaving for the World Cup, Agoos bought a house in
San Jose. It will come in handy for displaying the national team
jerseys that players traditionally swap after games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a home in D.C. and they're all over the place," Agoos
said. "I think I've only got about 15 up [framed and hung on the
wall] and I've got another hundred or so in a bag somewhere. Quite a
lot of Guatemalan and Costa Rican ones. We see those guys quite a
bit. This will be a little bit different."</TE>
<TE>   "This" is the World Cup, where Luis Figo, Rui Costa, Pauleta and
others await on Wednesday. Beyond that are South Korea and Poland in
the first round. And beyond that, who knows?</TE>
<TE>   "There are quite a few [player jerseys] that I would like here,
some that we're going to be playing and some that we're not going to
be playing," Agoos said. "It's great to play against some of the best
players in the world. The nice part about it is being able to get
their jersey. The challenging part for any good player is playing
against the best, and that's what we're doing here."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minus Pedro Martinez and Manny Ramirez, the Boston Red Sox still
looked like a first-place team.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Castillo shut down the majors' most dangerous lineup and,
backed by three home runs, Boston breezed past the New York Yankees,
7-1, Sunday at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Rickey Henderson, Nomar Garciaparra and Doug Mirabelli homered for
the Red Sox, who won two of three at Yankee Stadium in a matchup of
the teams with baseball's best records.</LD>
<TE>   Boston left town with a two-game lead over New York in the AL
East, and improved to 7-4 against the Yankees and 22-5 on the road
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We know as a team we can play with them, and we needed to prove
to everyone that we're for real," Mirabelli said.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees don't need to be persuaded.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like it's going to come down to these two teams battling
all season long," Yankee first baseman Jason Giambi said. "I just
hope we don't look back at the end of the season and say, 'Oh, if
we'd have won one more game.'"</TE>
<TE>   Almost everything went right for the Red Sox, even with Ramirez on
the disabled list and Martinez missing the series for an extra day of
rest.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson was carted off to a hospital after crashing into a wall,
but X-rays were negative. He bruised his lower back, and was OK to
leave with the Red Sox on their trip to Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo (4-5) once again tamed the club that leads the majors
with 91 home runs, holding the Yankees to one run and four hits in
eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 4, Chicago 3--Chuck Finley pitched seven shutout innings
as the Indians climbed back to .500 with a three-game sweep of
Chicago, which dropped its seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Finley (4-6) gave up four hits at Cleveland and didn't walk a
batter as the Indians won their fourth in a row and moved into a tie
for second in the AL Central with the reeling White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Chris Magruder homered and drove in three runs for the
Indians, who have won eight of 10.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 11, Baltimore 8--Bret Boone hit a grand slam and drove in
five runs at Baltimore as the Mariners rallied from a six-run deficit
for a payback victory over the Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   After blowing leads in the late innings of losses on Friday and
Saturday, the Mariners pulled off a stunning comeback of their own to
salvage a split of the four-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle trailed 6-0 after two innings and 7-1 after five before
scoring three runs in the sixth, three in the seventh and four in the
eighth for its biggest comeback victory of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 4, Tampa Bay 2--Mark Mulder won his second start in a row,
and Greg Myers homered as the Athletics won for the seventh time in
nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder (4-4) gave up two runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings at St.

in five starts since returning May 9 from a left forearm strain.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, Detroit 6--Eric Hinske ended Jeff Weaver's homerless
streak with a tiebreaking, two-run shot in the seventh inning for the
Blue Jays at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first home run Weaver has given up this season in 84
innings and first in 105 2/3 innings dating to last season. That

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Wooten Sidelined by Another Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Shawn Wooten could be sidelined until the All-Star break because of
his latest injury but, even as the Angels emerge as a legitimate
playoff contender, General Manager Bill Stoneman said Sunday it is
unlikely he will trade for another hitter.</LD>
<LD>   Wooten has a strained right ribcage muscle, Manager Mike Scioscia
said Sunday. He has not played for the Angels this season after
tearing a thumb ligament during spring training; he suffered the new
injury on a rehabilitation assignment. He was expected to rejoin the
team in about a week.</LD>
<LD>   Over the winter, the Angels had planned for Wooten to split time
with Scott Spiezio at first base. As the Angels stumbled to the worst
start in franchise history, they searched for a right-handed hitter,
but did not acquire one, and their interest cooled as the team heated
up and Wooten's anticipated return neared.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels have since added a right-handed bat, with Benji Gil
activated from the disabled list, and the team has a better record
against left-handed starters (10-4) than right-handed starters
(21-18). But, in addition to playing first base, the Angels wanted
Wooten to back up at catcher and designated hitter and provide power
off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say his role is filled," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff chances do not come every year, so there would appear to
be some urgency for Stoneman not to squander this one. But the Angels
are not likely to increase their player payroll at this time,
particularly to fill what Stoneman sees as a part-time job.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody out there is good and we can get him and he's
affordable, well, we're always looking," he said. "But thinking that
we'll do something right now is probably not very realistic."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, the Angels' decision not to put David Eckstein on
the disabled list appears to have backfired. Eckstein is expected to
return to shortstop tonight, his first defensive appearance since
spraining his left knee 14 days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Angels put him on the 15-day disabled list, they could
have kept reliever Mark Lukasiewicz on the roster for the seven games
against a Minnesota roster overloaded with left-handed hitters. The
Angels went 3-4 against the Twins. Dennis Cook, the Angels' remaining
left-handed reliever, pitched in five of those games.</TE>
<TE>   While his knee prevented him from playing defense, Eckstein
appeared in two games as the designated hitter. The Angels won those
games, 12-2 and 11-3.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever at-bats he gave us in the leadoff spot were worth the
price we had to pay to keep him active," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Garret Anderson, the only Angel to play in every game
this season, is uncertain for tonight's game. As he stole second base
in the ninth inning Sunday, Minnesota shortstop Cristian Guzman
caught the throw and inadvertently stepped on the middle finger of
Anderson's right hand, opening a gash.</TE>

<HD>Angels End Trip on Good Note</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>If fans are a bit lukewarm on the Angels this year, one reason might
be this: No one knows how good they are. They beat up on a bunch of
bad teams, but can they beat the good ones?</LD>
<LD>   It's difficult to tell, since there are so few good teams in the
American League. Of the 14 teams in the league, five have winning
records, the Angels included. They have not played the Boston Red Sox
or the New York Yankees, and they have lost six of seven to the
Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   So Sunday's 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins injected the
Angels with a dose of confidence for the long flight home and the
more challenging schedule ahead. The Angels had lost four of six
games against the Twins before Sunday, when Aaron Sele and a cast of
understudies stole the show.</LD>
<TE>   "It's good for us to win these close ones," Tim Salmon said. "We
really haven't had much of a challenge the past month. We've played
pretty well and won pretty easily at times. Against Minnesota, every
game seems to be a one-run game. That's good for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels set a team record for victories in May, but the Twins
were the only May opponent with a winning record. This month brings a
series against the Cincinnati Reds, another against the St. Louis
Cardinals and two against the Dodgers, and to win those the Angels
will need performances comparable to the ones they got Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   They got an outstanding outing from Sele, who reached the eighth
inning for the first time in 11 starts since joining the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Sele staggered at the start, walking two in the first inning. The
Twins did not score, but Sele escaped a bases-loaded jam.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Sele made his own adjustments, without a word from
pitching coach Bud Black.</TE>
<TE>   "When you walk two guys on nine pitches, it's a pretty simple
thing to figure out," Sele said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it doesn't get better, you're not going to be out there very
long."</TE>
<TE>   In his last start, he gave up 11 hits in five innings. In this
one, with better command of his fastball and much better command of
his curve, he gave up one hit in the first six innings, improving his
record against the Twins to 15-3. Troy Percival, who has given up no
earned runs in 35 innings against the Twins, pitched a perfect ninth
for the save.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won with a 12-hit attack that featured three hits from
Garret Anderson and Orlando Palmeiro and two from Jorge Fabregas.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro, a reserve outfielder, came within a home run of hitting
for the cycle and lifted his average to .347. Fabregas, the backup
catcher, boosted his average from .143 to .179.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel great," Fabregas said. "You feel like you're part of the
team."</TE>

<LD>Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who has been on the disabled list seven
weeks because of a herniated disk in his back, began a rehabilitation
assignment Sunday at Class A Port Charlotte.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez caught four innings and struck out in his only at-bat
Sunday against the Vero Beach Dodgers. The 10-time All-Star said he
didn't have any problems with his back.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez is expected to play four more games at Port Charlotte
and could rejoin the Rangers on Friday when they open a three-game
interleague series against Atlanta. He's been out since April 15.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Umpire Ed Rapuano said Sunday he accidentally bumped shoulders
with Bobby Valentine, prompting the heated exchange that led to the
ejection of the New York Met manager from Saturday night's game at
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The contact occurred after catcher Mike Piazza had already been
ejected for arguing with plate umpire Mark Wegner.</TE>
<TE>   "We both turned in the same direction when I was walking away and
happened to bump shoulders," Rapuano said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no reason or intent for me to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby made a comment after the bumping incident. That's when I
ejected him."</TE>
<TE>   Rapuano declined to say what Valentine said as they stood nose to
nose shouting.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Valentine complained about Rapuano's attitude and
said the umpire had lingering hard feelings about an argument with
the Mets during a game a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "What is this, the Gestapo?" Valentine said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby has his opinion," said Rapuano, who has been a major league
umpire for 12 years. "I've never had the reputation of being like
that. I'm just trying to keep the peace."</TE>

<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Wiseman's Ferry, a colt with the same front-running style as War
Emblem, is a definite for Saturday's Belmont Stakes, trainer Niall
O'Callaghan said at Churchill Downs on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The 134th Belmont lost a horse, however, when Craig Dollase, the
trainer of Tracemark, said that the runner-up to Wiseman's Ferry in
the Lone Star Derby would not run. That leaves the Belmont with a
12-horse field.</LD>
<LD>   Wiseman's Ferry, whose career started in Ireland with trainer
Aidan O'Brien, has won two of three starts in the U.S. He sprinted in
Europe before the Irish-born O'Callaghan tried him in longer two-turn
races as a 3-year-old. The Lone Star Derby, run May 11, was at 11/8
miles.</LD>
<TE>   "I might be pretty stupid to run," O'Callaghan said, "but at least
I'm smart enough to know that I'm stupid. I wish my horse's style
wasn't the same as War Emblem's. I don't have any clue whether my
horse can get the mile and a half. But it's the Belmont, and I think
we have to take a shot."</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Chavez, who won the 2001 Kentucky Derby with Monarchos, will
ride Wiseman's Ferry.</TE>
<TE>   Two Belmont probables had workouts Sunday. Proud Citizen ran five
furlongs at Churchill Downs in 1:00 and Like A Hero covered a
half-mile at Belmont Park in :49. War Emblem galloped 11/2 miles in
humid, 85-degree heat at Churchill.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Baker, David Cornstein and Bill Mack, who own Proud
Citizen, said that they have pledged their potential share of the
Belmont purse to the New York Twin Towers Fund. They have guaranteed
a contribution of $100,000. The Belmont is a $1-million race, with
first place worth $600,000.</TE>

<HD>Horry Expects Lakers to Re-energize</HD>
<DH>Game 7: Forward, like his teammates, is tired after

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Lakers had just won a seventh game on the road for the first time
in their history, they had to go into overtime to do it and they
probably should have been tired. Robert Horry stared straight ahead
to the NBA Finals and checked his schedule.</LD>
<LD>   "What day is it today?" Horry said. "Sunday?"</LD>
<LD>   "What day do the finals start? Wednesday?"</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, we got enough gas."</TE>
<TE>   That would be good news for the Lakers, who may not be as tired as
they are relieved after shedding themselves of those persistent
Sacramento Kings, 112-106, in front of a cowbell-ringing,
decibel-destroying sellout crowd of 17,317 at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Next up, of course, are the New Jersey Nets, and you know all
about them. Horry provided an early scouting report.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a nice little team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It must be comforting for the Eastern Conference champions to hear
they have a nice little team. As for the Kings, the end of their
season didn't end all that nicely, at the hands of the Lakers for the
third consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   It could have gone the other way, but didn't, a circumstance that
can be traced to the usual places--35 points by Shaquille O'Neal and
30 by Kobe Bryant--but also to some unexpected sources, courtesy of
the Kings. There was some classic masonry work done by Doug Christie
and Peja Stojakovic at exactly the wrong time, not to mention 14
missed free throws out of 30.</TE>
<TE>   Horry offered a blunt assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't know what they were doing down the stretch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Lakers knew exactly what they were doing,
coming back from a 3-2 deficit in a best-of-seven series and having
to win the deciding game on the road. So what if they had never done
it before. Maybe it was just like Horry said. He wanted a chance for
another championship ring that would give him five.</TE>
<TE>   "One for each finger," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But before the quest for more jewelry for Horry and the rest of
the Lakers could continue, there was this matter of the Kings to
settle. Rick Fox, who said he had heard more than once that the
Lakers were toast and got upset about it, all but predicted a Laker
victory over the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "It could conceivably come off as arrogance, I know, but I just
knew with our history, we would find a way to win on the road," he
said. "It is not a fluke. We have it in us."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly what Fox had was 14 rebounds, more than anyone on the
court. Fox also had seven assists, more than any Laker except for
Derek Fisher, who also had seven. Horry's 16 points and 12 rebounds,
plus four clutch free throws by Fisher in overtime, should prove the
main point of Fox. The Lakers are O'Neal and Bryant, but they go
slightly deeper than that.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said he had something to get off his chest and this seemed as
good a time as any to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "We were criticized often in this series--'The Lakers can't get it
done'--well, we still have the heart of a champion."</TE>
<TE>   The best way to describe the series, according to Fox, is one
word: "Brutal."</TE>
<TE>   It's also the best way to describe the Kings when the game was on
the line.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of tension and you could see it when those jumps
shots that didn't draw iron. There is tension for both teams. But if
someone has never been here before, you just don't understand it,"
Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   What Fisher understood was the bottom line, which each Laker
clearly understood.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fortunate to get out of here with a win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Horry picked up where Fox left off, on the Laker underdog theme,
as implausible as that may sound since this is a two-time
defending-champion team you're talking about. But Horry should be
allowed to have his say, on an occasion such as this.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a lot of people saying we couldn't do it. We couldn't do
it in Sacramento's house. We stayed calm and did it," Horry said.</TE>
<TE>   And what of another issue, the entire Laker bench producing a
total of five points? The Lakers promise to stay calm this time, too,
Horry insists.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care about that," he said. "We like it that way. Then we
can come up and bite you ... and feel a lot better about it."</TE>

<LD>Mitch Albom in the Detroit Free Press: "Here we go again. Happens
every four years. Somewhere on the planet they are playing the World
Cup of soccer. So we in America must get a lecture.</LD>
<LD>   "Why isn't soccer popular the U.S.? What's the matter with you?
It's the biggest sporting event in the world!</LD>
<LD>   "With all due respect, no it isn't. Because the world when it
comes to sports, is defined by where your world begins and ends....</LD>
<TE>   "Three out of four Americans couldn't care less. Does that make us
pompous? On the contrary, it suggests we have other things to do."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the record for most three-point field-goal
attempts in an NBA playoff game?</TE>
<TE>   Don't care enough: Bob Kravitz in the Indianapolis Star: "You know
what? We say we care and at a very visceral level, I'm sure the
latest steroids-in-baseball revelations do inspire some outrage.</TE>
<TE>   "But for the most part, we don't care, not enough to force a
change in the culture of sports.</TE>
<TE>   "If we really cared, if we were truly outraged and completely fed
up, we'd stop going to games and stop watching games on television,
and stop buying merchandise."</TE>
<TE>   Math major: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "Phillies'
catcher Mike Lieberthal had this to say about the accusations of
rampant use of steroids in Major League Baseball: 'Fifty percent?
That's ridiculous! Fifty percent would mean half our guys.'</TE>
<TE>   "You've go to get up pretty early to get anything past Mike."</TE>
<TE>   More Greene: "In the June 3 issue of Sports Illustrated, Evel
Knievel is asked what it was like to have been in a coma.</TE>
<TE>   Answered Evel: "How the .... do I know? I was in a coma."</TE>
<TE>   He'd rather sleep: Steve Hummer in the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution on the early TV times for the World Cup: "The
only good reason to watch a soccer game is if you have a kid playing
in it. And even then it pretty much has to be a first-born child, not
one of the sequels."</TE>
<TE>   Saluting baseball: Mike Lopresti in USA Today: "Take me out to the
ballgame. Take me out to the crowd. Give me some hormones, andro will
do. If I take enough, I'll make $10 million, too."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1932, Yankee Lou Gehrig hit four home
runs in a game at Philadelphia and John McGraw retired after 31
seasons as manager of the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   It's a mad world: Bob Knight is being courted for the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, Texas Tech's basketball coach, is scheduled to appear with
actors Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler in the upcoming movie "Anger
Management."</TE>
<TE>   The film, scheduled for a June 2003 release, is about a
mild-mannered man (Sandler), who is mistakenly sent to an anger
management help group.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Rex Chapman of Phoenix, 17 against Seattle on April
25, 1997. He made nine.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News: "Sam
Snead wasn't above a hustle of two.... At his home resort courses in
Virginia, Sam bet he could beat a guest using only a tree branch for
a club.</TE>
<TE>   "He actually had a hickory limb that he had honed and balanced on
his workshop lathe, and it worked beautifully for him."</TE>

<LD>   What: "SportsCentury: Kobe Bryant"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN Classic, tonight, 5 and 8</LD>
<TE>   It has become apparent that documenting Kobe Bryant's life is not
easy. "Beyond the Glory" had moderate success. Now "Sports Century"
has learned how tightly Bryant guards his private life.</TE>
<TE>   This one-hour show, which will be repeated on ESPN a week from
today at 1 p.m., is worth watching. But there's not much new.</TE>
<TE>   Comparisons to Michael Jordan are dealt with in the opening
segment. Then comes a look at his childhood in Italy, his high school
years in suburban Philadelphia, his decision to forego college, and
his learning to fit in with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you didn't speak to Kobe first he may not even speak," Derek
Fisher says. "And at first I was kind of taken aback by that and
almost offended."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher and Rick Fox offer brief perspectives, but Shaquille O'Neal
is seen only talking at news conferences and Phil Jackson is seen
only in old clips.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry West, a willing participant in the show, says of Bryant:
"What impressed me the most was his ability to articulate the reasons
he wanted to play in the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant says, "What I found out is that the game of basketball has
really been a great teacher of life as far as unending challenges,
teamwork, doing things together."</TE>

<LD>Brazil was dealt a major setback when team captain Emerson dislocated
his shoulder in practice and was ruled out of the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The Roma midfielder was hurt while playing goalkeeper at an
informal scrimmage at Munsu Stadium in Ulsan, South Korea, where
Brazil plays Turkey today in the opening Group C match. Diving to
make a save on a shot by Rivaldo, Emerson fell heavily and his right
shoulder popped out of the joint team doctor Jose Luis Runco said</LD>
<LD>   Emerson's immediate sub is Vampeta, though Kleberson and Gilberto
Silva also play the position. The roster spot will be filled by
Ricardinho from Corinthians.</LD>

<TE>   While ABC showed taped-delayed coverage of the 1-1 tie between
England and Sweden throughout the nation at 12:30 p.m. PDT Sunday,
KABC Channel 7 in Los Angeles preempted the network's World Cup
coverage in favor of a Children's Miracle Network special.</TE>
<TE>   The special had been planned ahead of time, but some program
listings, including those in The Times' sports section Sunday, had
ABC's soccer coverage being shown by Channel 7 at 12:30. The station
reported it received hundreds of complaint calls from angry soccer
fans.</TE>
<TE>   Coverage of the England-Sweden game, which was played live in
Japan at 2:30 a.m. PDT on Sunday, was eventually shown by Channel 7
at 12:30 a.m. today, 22 hours later.</TE>

<LD>   "I'm not even a big footballer, I'm more of a rugby man," said

<HD>Tightrope Act Works for Ishii</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He struggles again, improves to 9-1 with 6-3 win
over Diamondbacks, whose lead is cut to one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kazuhisa Ishii did it again with the Dodgers' help, rolling along
despite his continuing command problems Sunday in a 6-3 victory over
the Arizona Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The left-hander followed a familiar pattern in improving to 9-1
and helping the second-place Dodgers take two of three from the
National League West leaders, overcoming five walks and two home runs
in an inefficient six-inning outing before a sellout crowd of 53,474.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii added to his growing reputation as an escape artist, making
enough timely pitches to win for the third time in as many starts
despite seemingly facing jams in every inning.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers did their part to help Ishii maintain a charmed life
in his first season in the major leagues, scoring three runs in the
sixth and seventh to rally from a 2-0 deficit. Arizona first baseman
Mark Grace committed a costly error in the sixth, and Eric Karros'
three-run home run in the seventh against Diamondback starter Miguel
Batista (2-3) provided the knockout punch.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne overwhelmed Arizona in the ninth after setup man
Paul Quantrill struggled, striking out pinch-hitter Steve Finley to
record his 20th save in 21 opportunities and completing a 5-1 home
stand for the Dodgers, who pulled within a game of the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Everything held to form with Ishii pitching, meaning the Dodgers
were on the edge of their seats throughout and smiling at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I've been saying all year long in the case of Kazuhisa
Ishii: There were a couple of situations that you would not like to
see him get himself into," Manager Jim Tracy said. "And yet, every
time I've seen that happen, he makes a quality pitch and gets the man
out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the formula that you prescribe for anybody ... but he
has a tremendous ability of making quality pitches and getting big
hitters out in big situations. Some of those situations, he has
created for himself, but he has an uncanny ability to be able to
[escape jams]."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii gave up five hits, including homers to Arizona starter
Batista, the second of his career, and Greg Colbrunn's third this
season. He also had six strikeouts while throwing 62 strikes in 104
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ishii would prefer to make things easier for himself and
the Dodgers, he is enthusiastic about the results.</TE>
<TE>   "I think more than being lucky, I just try to give my team the
best chance there is to win," Ishii he said through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks helped, stranding 11 runners and opening the door
for the Dodgers. They capitalized in the sixth when Grace, a
four-time Gold Glove winner, watched Shawn Green's grounder go off
his glove and into right field with none out, enabling Paul Lo Duca
to score from second after his leadoff double.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also got run-scoring singles from Dave Hansen and Mark
Grudzielanek to go ahead, 3-2. Arizona left runners on the corners in
the seventh against Giovanni Carrara, setting the stage for Karros.</TE>
<TE>   Green and Brian Jordan had consecutive two-out singles, and then
Karros hit his fifth homer into the left-field pavilion on a 1-and-1
count.</TE>
<TE>   Karros was more interested in Ishii's day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been pretty amazing," Karros said. "He gets himself in some
tough situations, but he always seems to get himself out.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was happening once or twice or three times, then you'd say
it was just coincidence or it was luck. But that seems to be the
pattern for him. You're on edge all the time, but so far it has
worked."</TE>

<LD>Manager Jim Tracy gave struggling third baseman Adrian Beltre some
time off Sunday, using him as a defensive replacement in a 6-3
victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Beltre, who batted only .207 in May, replaced Dave Hansen in the
seventh with the Dodgers leading, 3-2. Although he struck out
swinging in the eighth, Beltre said the break helped.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought it was going to be all day off, but I'm always ready if
Trace needs me," said Beltre, batting .245 overall. "He told me I was
going to have a day off just to clear my mind before we go on the
road trip.</LD>
<TE>   "He just wanted me to relax, and get me out of that whole thinking
about struggling right now. I enjoyed my half-day off."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Kevin Brown (sprained right elbow) won't be activated
from the disabled list when he is eligible to pitch June 11. Tracy
said Brown still "has the inflammation in the back of his elbow,"
prompting the club to proceed cautiously.... Left-handed reliever
Terry Mulholland (strained lower back) had another bullpen session
and is close to being activated from the disabled list, Tracy said.
Mulholland, not expected to go on a rehabilitation assignment, is
scheduled to pitch a simulated game Tuesday at Coors Field....
Right-hander Darren Dreifort, rehabilitating from elbow surgery,
continued his throwing program. Tracy said the club does not have a
target date for Dreifort's return.</TE>

<HD>Thoroughly Bred Now</HD>
<DH>War Emblem's success goes back to Our Emblem</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DARLINGTON, Md.</DL>
<LD>Four days after the Preakness, late in the afternoon at Murmur Farm,
the phone rang in Audrey and Allen Murray's office. On the other end
was a man with a mare in Georgia, wanting to breed her to Our Emblem.</LD>
<LD>   A sire that had not even been a singles hitter for two years in
Kentucky, Our Emblem became an overnight slugger with the victories
by his son War Emblem in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and the
Murrays, who bought the then-unwanted stallion cheaply last November,
were by mid-May accustomed to a deluge of calls. But this entreaty
from Georgia was especially pushy.</LD>
<LD>   Softly and politely, Audrey Murray told the man that Our Emblem
was booked up for the rest of the current breeding season, which ends
July 1. About five different ways, she told him that this was the
case.</LD>
<TE>   "How many mares will he wind up having?" said the man, making one
more desperate try.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-five," Audrey Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he said, "that's an odd number, an unlucky number. Why
don't you make my mare No. 96?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, if I counted them again," Murray said, "I'd probably find
that I have 96 already. Look, I'm doing a [newspaper] interview and I
have to get off. It's just impossible to add one more mare. Just the
other day, we had to turn down a mare from Kentucky, and she was a
producer of a Grade I winner. The poor horse can only do so much. We
have to protect him."</TE>
<TE>   While Murray was taking this call, her husband was with a
contingent from Kentucky that included Doug Cauthen of WinStar Farm.
They were watching Our Emblem breed to his third mare of the day.
Less than a week later, WinStar and its partner, Taylor Made Farm,
announced that they had bought Our Emblem for $10.1 million. The
11-year-old stallion's next breeding season, which begins Feb. 15,
2003, will be back in Kentucky, where he flopped the first time
around.</TE>
<TE>   "We were probably going to sell," Allen Murray said, "but unless a
very good offer came along, we were going to wait until after the
Belmont. But this was a very good offer, an offer we couldn't
refuse."</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, one of four stakes winners by Our Emblem this year
after the sire had accounted for only one minor stakes winner from
his first crops, can become the first Triple Crown winner since
Affirmed in 1978 if he wins the Belmont Stakes on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Selling the horse is not going to change our lives," said
69-year-old Allen Murray, a retired electrical engineer who designed
tank armor for the U.S. government. "Five months out of the year, we
work very hard, seven days a week. The rest of the year, we back off,
and while still caring for the farm we're only really working hard
about one day a week. We take time off to go on vacations, like a
cruise to Spain a year ago. Selling this horse is not going to change
all that."</TE>
<TE>   The Murrays are believed to have paid $200,000 last year for Our
Emblem, who raced for Ogden Phipps--winning five of 27 starts, no
stakes and earning $366,013--and first stood at aristocratic
Claiborne Farm near Paris, Ky. Estimates of what the Phipps family
got for the stallion have ranged from $40,000 upward, and the Murrays
will say only that they bought him for a six-figure sum.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised Claiborne gave up on him so soon," a Kentucky
breeder said. "Usually you wait at least three crops to get the feel
of what a stallion can do."</TE>
<TE>   Claiborne, where Derby winners Johnstown (1939) and Swale (1984)
were bred, is doing no second-guessing.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, we thought it was a good move," said Gus Koch,
assistant manager of the farm. "We still do."</TE>
<TE>   Our Emblem's first 31 foals, from the 1998 breeding season, earned
only $498,808 and the only stakes winner was Uncle Punk, who won an
added-money race at Arapahoe Park near Denver. At auction, Our
Emblem's progeny averaged only $9,000 a horse in 2000. Until this
year, Our Emblem's second crop was also undistinguished. At
Claiborne, his stud fee was only going down.</TE>
<TE>   The Murrays, high-school sweethearts who have been married for 47
years, usually keep six or seven stallions at Murmur Farm, a
well-kept 133-acre spread that from one rise affords a magnificent
view of the Susquehanna River. They had owned a farm about 10 miles
from here, and in 1988, looking for a larger property, they bought
and renamed (repeating the first three letters of their last name)
the old Ardmore Farm. It had been owned by the estate of Thomas
Barry, who trained Belmont Stakes winners Cavan in 1958 and Celtic
Ash in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   The Murrays, who breed to race and sell, hadn't added a new
stallion since Crypto Star, the 1997 Arkansas and Louisiana Derby
winner, and last fall they visited several Kentucky farms.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for something that we might be able to
re-syndicate," Audrey Murray said. "Then when we looked at Our
Emblem, we saw that he had no soundness problems and had bloodlines
that might be attractive to Marylanders."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Taylor, one of the owners of Taylor Made Farm in
Nicholasville, Ky., says that Our Emblem "is probably the best-bred
horse currently at stud." Bred by Ogden Phipps, who died in April,
Our Emblem is a son of the late Mr. Prospector, who was a hallmark
sire, and Personal Ensign, undefeated in her 13 races and producer of
three Grade I stakes winners.</TE>
<TE>   Having closed the deal in Kentucky, the Murrays brought Our Emblem
to Maryland, where he was largely received with indifference. At
$7,500 a share--a share being the right to breed to a stallion once a
year for life--only 15 shares were sold, mostly to longtime friends
and clients of the Murrays. The Murrays retained 25 shares and a
majority ownership in the stallion.</TE>
<TE>   Our Emblem began his second career at stud for a fee of $4,000,
which is the amount a non-shareholder would have to pay for a
one-time breeding. The Murrays had sold 40 of these breedings before
War Emblem's breakout win, in the Illinois Derby on April 6. The next
week, three things happened: Ahmed Salman, the Saudi Arabian prince,
bought a 90% interest in War Emblem for $900,000; Our Emblem's stud
fee was raised to $7,500; and the phone at Murmur Farm started
ringing ... and ringing. By the time War Emblem won the Kentucky
Derby, most of the 95 breeding slots had been sold. But 100 calls a
day to Murmur was not uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   On Derby day, many of the 15 original shareholders gathered at
Murmur Farm, in the 150-year-old stone house where the Murrays live.
When War Emblem protected his lead to win by four lengths, the crowd
jumped up and down. Champagne corks popped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unbelievable thing," Audrey Murray said. "It's just a
phenomenal thing. It's been something that's helped all of Maryland
racing, and it's a romantic story that can be an inspiration to
others in the business."</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, the result of a mating between Our Emblem and Sweetest
Lady, a Lord At War mare, was bred by Charles Nuckols Jr. and his two
sons, who operate Nuckols Farm in Midway, Ky., about 60 miles east of
Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Midway is a one-stoplight, one-main-drag town of about 1,600, but
in horse circles its reputation is well-served. Three of the last
four Kentucky Derby winners--Charismatic, Monarchos and now War
Emblem--have Midway ties. John Oxley, who owns a farm just across the
road from Nuckols Farm, raced Monarchos, last year's Derby winner.</TE>
<TE>   The day of the Illinois Derby, Charles "Nucks" Nuckols III, his
father's older son, was standing next to Oxley as they watched on TV
from the Keeneland track. After War Emblem cantered home by more than
six lengths, Oxley said to Nuckols:</TE>
<TE>   "Refresh my memory, Nucks. Did I buy 50% of that colt, or the
whole horse? I can't remember."</TE>
<TE>   Oxley was chiding himself. He and his trainer, John Ward Jr., had
turned down War Emblem, because of ankle and knee chips, before
Prince Salman came along.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem was foaled at 6 p.m. on Feb . 20, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Reineman, a Chicago businessman whose relationship with
Charlie Nuckols goes back more than 40 years, leases his broodmares
to Nuckols Farm. On behalf of Reineman, War Emblem was consigned to a
yearling sale at Keeneland in September of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked plain and immature," Nucks Nuckols said. The bidding
never took off, and Reineman bought the colt back for $20,000. War
Emblem ran seven times, winning four, for Reineman before he was
sold.</TE>
<TE>   The well-known story by now is that Reineman, Nuckols Farm's major
client, has been left with only 10% of War Emblem, and the Derby
winner's dam, Sweetest Lady, is no longer around. In foal to
Distorted Humor, she died from massive hemorrhaging after foaling a
colt last year. A month later, the foal also died. Sweetest Lady, who
was 11, had produced only four foals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the business," Nucks Nuckols said last Friday. "Today we
had a 3-month-old foal, one of Mr. Reineman's, drop dead. We found
another foal with an abscess on the lung. These are the things that
happen. They bring you back to reality real quick."</TE>

<KH>Charting the Lead: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>Game 7 Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First Quarter</LD>
<LD>   LAKERS 22  SACRAMENTO 21</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: After a while, the din inside Arco Arena is simply
meaningless. Crowd noise isn't going to settle this thing. That DMV
worker in the 10th row behind the basket or that waiter in the 12th
row behind the Laker bench with the cowbell isn't going to stop
Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant any more than they're going to guide
a jumper from Mike Bibby or Chris Webber into the basket.</LD>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The heart rates of the 10 players and three
refs to start the game. Everyone seemed a little too eager at the
start. Shots missed the mark. Passes had too much on them. Fouls were
harder than they needed to be.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: O'Neal's three-for-four shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Bryant's three-for-nine shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 7, Bryant 6; Kings--Bibby 7,
Webber 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal and Rick Fox 4; Kings--Vlade
Divac 5, Doug Christie 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second Quarter</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS 52  SACRAMENTO 54</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Kings went on a 10-3 run to build a 47-42 lead
late in the quarter. The Lakers closed within two by halftime,
sending a message back to the Kings. The Lakers were not going to
disappear. They would tail the Kings to the concession stands, if
necessary, if it meant staying in touch before the final buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The tension began to build, and there's no
sign of it troubling either team. They're circling for the moment,
looking for a weakness, trying anything to land a knockout blow.
There are none forthcoming, however. It's tighter than imaginable.
And there's still a half to be played.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Bryant had 19 shots by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Bryant made only eight.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 12, O'Neal 11; Kings--Webber and
Bobby Jackson 8.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Bryant 4, Fox 2; Kings--Webber and
Peja Stojakovic 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third Quarter</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS 73  SACRAMENTO 74</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Divac picked up his fourth foul with 5:29 to play.
The Kings led, 65-58, at that point, but the lead didn't last. Bryant
made one of two free throws, then swished a three-pointer and fed
Slava Medvedenko (!) for an easy layup. Suddenly, Bryant had led the
Lakers within 65-64. Pulling away from the Lakers would be harder to
do than the Kings could ever have imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Much of anything from Webber. He took one
shot and made it. He did have four assists, so it wasn't as if he
wasn't handling the ball. He was looking to pass instead of shoot-
ing, though, and you had to wonder about it.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Two fouls against O'Neal and none against Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Kings' three-for-nine free-throw shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 6, O'Neal and Fox 4; Kings--Hedo
Turkoglu 6, Divac 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Fox 5, Horry 3; Kings--Christie and
Divac 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fourth Quarter</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS 100  SACRAMENTO 100</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Bibby is in the playoffs for the first time, but
it sure didn't seem that way. Without him, the Kings would have been
lost. He scored 10 of their last 12 points, making jumpers after
coming around screens. The Lakers never caught on to the play and
paid a steep price in getting forced to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Points from Christie. He was a factor on
both ends of the floor during this series, but perhaps his dogged
play against Bryant had taken its toll. He was never in a position to
take a shot. He missed an open three-pointer, his only attempt of
this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Bibby's tying free throws came with 8.2 seconds
left, the same time on the clock for his winning jumper in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Divac's sixth foul with 46.3 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Horry 8, O'Neal 7; Kings--Bibby 12.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 6, Horry 3; Kings--Jackson 3,
Turkoglu 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Overtime</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS 112  SACRAMENTO 106</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Nothing spectacular. The Lakers plugged away, made
their free throws, muzzled the Kings for the last 2:17 and lived to
play another day. Bibby ended the game by scoring 14 of the Kings'
last 18 points, a rare display of imbalance that hurt in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Bibby and Webber were the only Kings to
score in overtime, giving them a predictable look that the Lakers
easily contained down the stretch. The Kings ran the pick-and-roll
again and again and the Lakers finally caught on. The Lakers must
play it better when they face the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.
Scary thought: Jason Kidd is even better with the ball than Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Lakers' eight-for-eight free-throw shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Kings' three-for-12 shooting from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 6, Derek Fisher 4; Kings--Bibby 4,
Webber 2.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry, Bryant 2; Kings--Christie,
Turkoglu 2.</TE>

<HD>French Kiss-Off for Hewitt; Kuerten Falls Too</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Top-ranked Australian draws ire of crowd in loss to
Canas, while defending champ exits more graciously.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>One man waved to the crowd, relinquishing his stage with a smile,
ending his two-year reign at the French Open by blowing a kiss. The
French responded by showing Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten a little love
on the way out the door.</LD>
<LD>   About half an hour earlier, the world's top player exited with
baggage, a loss and a chorus of Parisian boos. He had tossed his
racket a few times, and in fairness, so did his opponent, but
Australian Lleyton Hewitt drew their ire, by, heaven forbid, taking a
healthy whack at the courtside red geraniums, a French no-no.</LD>
<LD>   Where have all the flowers gone?</LD>
<TE>   A better question: Where did all the top male players go on
Sunday?</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the top-seeded Hewitt and two-time defending champion
Kuerten depart, but so did No. 3 Tommy Haas of Germany, dismissed by
Andrei Pavel of Romania, 6-1, 7-6 (9), 6-4, in another fourth-round
match.</TE>
<TE>   Clay-court veteran Albert Costa of Spain never allowed the
seventh-seeded Kuerten to get comfortable, winning, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of doubts about coming here," said Kuerten, who had
hip surgery in February. "I made a good run.... I think I'm pretty
close to my best level again, so that makes me more happy on the
court."</TE>
<TE>   The highest-seeded player left in the upper half of the draw is
No. 15 Guillermo Canas of Argentina, who beat Hewitt in a marathon,
6-7 (1), 7-6 (13), 6-4, 6-3, in 4 hours 14 minutes, as the Australian
dropped the final six games.</TE>
<TE>   It was a busy day at Roland Garros, so much so that defending
champion Jennifer Capriati requested to be moved to Court 1 because
matches were running long. Capriati avenged an earlier defeat this
year to Patty Schnyder of Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very difficult match for me, just so much more mentally
and physically," said Capriati, who won the fourth-round match, 6-4,
6-4. "She's a tough player to play."</TE>
<TE>   Advancing in straight sets were No. 2 Venus Williams, No. 6 Monica
Seles and No. 7 Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   There were three upsets--2000 champion Mary Pierce of France
defeated No. 9 Silvia Farina Elia of Italy, 6-1, 6-2; Clarisa
Fernandez of Argentina beat No. 11 Elena Dementieva of Russia, 3-6,
6-2, 6-3, and Paola Suarez of Argentina outlasted No. 10 Amelie
Mauresmo of France, winning, 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how she could stop this from happening again here,
Mauresmo, a first-round loser here last year, said, "Clear my brain,
have a brain graft. With an empty brain, perhaps it would be better."</TE>
<TE>   Confidence-wise, No. 3 Serena Williams is at the other end. She
started slowly and finished in top form, defeating Russian qualifier
Vera Zvonareva, 4-6, 6-0, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get scared," Williams said. "It's definitely not an
emotion I feel on the court."</TE>
<TE>   Once again, she was asked about Indian Wells. Last year, Serena
was treated harshly by the crowd in the final there and did not come
back in 2002. Nor did Venus, who had withdrawn from a semifinal
against Serena about five minutes beforehand because of an injured
knee, drawing the ire of the spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously you're saying I'm a Christian, I should turn the other
cheek," Serena said. "Obviously, Jesus did that and stuff. We've been
oppressed a long time. We've been turning our cheek a lot. I'm just
not ready now."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, she left the door open, ever so slightly,
saying: "Maybe next year."</TE>
<TE>   In the quarterfinals, Capriati will play Dokic, Serena Williams
will face Pierce, Seles will meet Venus Williams and, in an
all-Argentine match, Fernandez will face Suarez.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the result, I think this is going to be something
beautiful for Argentina," Suarez said.</TE>
<TE>   It was that kind of day for Argentina, starting with a World Cup
victory, two women reaching the quarterfinals and finishing with
Canas knocking off No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Canas defeated Hewitt for the first time in six matches, and
showed uncommon stamina and resilience. In the third round, he needed
five sets to defeat Carlos Moya of Spain. The 24-year-old Canas has
been on the court 8 hours 42 minutes his last two matches.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty strong," Hewitt said. "There's times where you think
he's looking a bit tired and then he bounces back pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional high point of the passion-filled match was the
second-set tiebreaker. Canas won it, 15-13, fighting off five set
points. Hewitt staved off five set points before the tiebreaker and
four more in the tiebreaker when Canas won it with a forehand winner.
In all, the set lasted 91 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's the most unbelievable, but the most exciting
tiebreak I ever played," said Canas, who avenged a five-set
fourth-round loss to Hewitt here last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt looked to push it to five sets, leading, 3-0, in the
fourth, but unraveled in a litany of errors. He had 105 unforced
errors and double faulted 15 times.</TE>
<TE>   Canas had some insight into why the crowd booed Hewitt. They
aren't close, Canas said, but they have practiced together.</TE>
<TE>   "We play many times in the last year," Canas said. "I think
[Hewitt] is nice guy off the court. I think, maybe [he] is a little
bit tough inside of the court. But everybody know this."</TE>

<HD>Gagne Says Secret Is Hard Work, Not Steroids</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Surprising Dodger closer doesn't want his success
to be tainted by recent revelations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Becoming the first Dodger to address speculation about his own
possible steroid use, first-year closer Eric Gagne said Sunday his
surprising success this season "has nothing to do with any steroids."</LD>
<LD>   Gagne acknowledged he added muscle during the winter and throws
harder than he did last season, attributing his physical improvement
to an intense off-season workout program. The converted starter is
frustrated that allegations of rampant steroid use have cast a shadow
over the major leagues and possibly tainted the accomplishments of
some players, saying he did things the old-fashioned way.</LD>
<LD>   "I know what I did, I know how hard I worked in the off-season,
and it didn't have anything to do with [steroids]," Gagne said. "Now,
because of all this stuff, people are going to look at players who
hit 50 home runs, or guys who throw hard, and say, 'Oh, he's using
steroids.' That's ridiculous.</LD>
<TE>   "As soon as you do good they're going to say, 'OK, steroids,' and
that's just wrong. Like I said, I'm not worried because I know what I
did and didn't do."</TE>
<TE>   Players have come under the microscope recently in the wake of
comments made by retired stars Ken Caminiti and Jose Canseco. In a
Sports Illustrated story, Caminiti claimed that 50% of big leaguers
use steroids, and Canseco put the number at 85% in a radio interview.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne said those figures have nothing to do with him.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at me, I'm bigger now [than in 2001] because I
worked out with a guy in Montreal, a hockey player, all winter," he
said. "My legs are much bigger, but I've always been a pretty big
guy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really not a big deal; it's not like I gained 40 pounds or
something. I gained what, maybe 10 pounds. I lost some weight and I
gained some muscle. I just worked out hard."</TE>
<TE>   Pitchers have not come under much scrutiny because steroids are
commonly associated with batters adding muscle to increase power.
However, although there have not been studies on the effects of
steroid use on baseball players, sports physicians said the drugs are
believed to help pitchers increase velocity.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne reported to spring training heavier than last season and
having increased the velocity on his fastball to consistently 97 mph,
from 94 mph, prompting some to wonder about the secrets of his
success.</TE>
<TE>   He has emerged as one of the majors' top closers after struggling
in the rotation for parts of two seasons, converting 20 of 21 save
opportunities with a 1.53 earned-run average. Gagne, who does not
have a decision in 27 games, has 39 strikeouts in 29 1/3 innings and
has limited opponents to a .155 batting average.</TE>
<TE>   Again, Gagne wants to set the record straight.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw 94 to 95 [mph] last year, so it's not a great
difference," he said. "Two miles an hour harder. That's a lot?</TE>
<TE>   "There are guys who have worked really hard their whole careers.
There are guys who have always had power and throw hard."</TE>
<TE>   The Major League Baseball Players Assn. historically has opposed
drug testing, but it might be forced to change its stance on steroids
because of public opinion. Gagne fears that the reputations of some
players have been forever damaged.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, nobody is going to care about how hard you
work because of this," he said. "They're just going to say, 'Oh, he's
on 'roids,' because he's throwing harder and hitting home runs.
That's it."</TE>

<HD>Estes Takes Safe Way to Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playing a conservative and steady game while playing partner Bob
Burns, Rich Beem and others bounced up and down a crowded
leaderboard, Bob Estes won the Kemper Insurance Open on Sunday at
Potomac, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Estes' round of 17 pars and one birdie for a 11-under total of 273
gave him his fourth PGA Tour victory in a tournament where difficult
conditions made the course play like a major.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a U.S. Open kind of setup and round," said Estes, who beat
Beem by one stroke and Burns and Steve Elkington by two. "That
experience helped me out a lot today. It was really a smart round of
golf for the most part--there weren't a lot of birdies out there."</LD>
<TE>   There was drama. Burns took the lead with a hole in one at the
11th hole. Five holes later, Estes played a shot to the fat part of
the green, then watched Burns take a risky approach shot that
eventually rolled onto a drainage grate. Burns ended up with a double
bogey, and Estes was back in the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Estes acknowledged he didn't take a single risky shot during his
one-under, final-round 70, which earned him the winner's share of
$648,000 and broke the tournament's three-year streak of first-time
winners.</TE>
<TE>   Elkington, Justin Leonard and Beem were all in the hunt until
hitting into the bunker at the back of the par-three 17th.</TE>
<TE>   Elkington and Beem each lost a shot on the hole to fall to 10
under, and Leonard dropped two shots to go to eight under.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament was also notable as the final one for Ken Venturi,
a former U.S. Open winner turned golf analyst who retired from the
broadcast booth after 35 years.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll always be in my thoughts," Venturi said. "It's been a long
time. I don't know where the time went--35 years. It's unbelievable.
I've really been very lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Many players paid tribute to Venturi as they finished their
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Chris DiMarco looked to the broadcast tower and clapped as he
walked off the 18th green. Leonard doffed his cap. Greg Norman
pointed toward Venturi and threw his ball toward the booth, despite
coming off a three-putt bogey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No record seems safe from Annika Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a year after shooting the first 59 in LPGA
history, Sorenstam matched the best 54-score on the tour in winning
the inaugural Kellogg-Keebler Classic at Aurora, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam fashioned a 21-under 195 with a sizzling finish to win
by 11 strokes, the largest margin on the tour this year.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth tour victory of the season and 35th overall for
Sorenstam, who closed with a seven-under 65, and it set her up for a
strong run at the tour's second major, the LPGA Championship starting
Thursday at the DuPont Country Club in Wilmington, Del.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, she matched the best 54-hole winning score in relation to
par. Wendy Ward was 21 under in the 2001 Wendy's Championship.
Danielle Ammaccapane (71), Michele Redman (68) and Mhairi McKay (70)
tied for second at 10 under.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James Mason, the 51-year-old teaching pro from Dillard, Ga., who
had to qualify for the tournament, shot a three-under 69 to win the
NFL Golf Classic by two strokes at Clifton, N.J. Mason made an eagle
with an iron from the second fairway and a birdie from the bunker on
the sixth hole in becoming the first qualifier to win on the senior
tour since Jim Ahern in the 1999 AT&amp;T Canada Senior Open. Mason is
the eighth qualifier to win a senior title.</TE>
<TE>   Mason, who earned $195,000 and a one-year exemption, had a
nine-under 207 total on the Upper Montclair course. Dave Eichelberger
(72), Bruce Fleisher (67) and Morris Hatalsky (67) tied for second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's Lorena Ochoa, a sophomore who left the University of
Arizona to play in her first pro tournament, tied for second, one
stroke behind winner Melinda Price in the Futures Tour's Aurora
Health Care Charity Golf Classic at Sussex, Wis. Price finished with
a two-over 218.</TE>

<HD>Kings Have Little Reason to Feel Discouraged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>One town, one team, one dream....</LD>
<LD>   Well, two out of three aren't bad.</LD>
<LD>   The city is still intact, the Kings are unbowed, but the dream,
which came so close to coming true, died Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers, who hadn't led this series since Game 1, prevailed
over the Kings, as they always seem to prevail over the Kings. King
fans began streaming out in the closing seconds, deprived even of an
obvious bad call to boo.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, after Game 6, when the Lakers shot their now-famous 27
free throws in the fourth quarter, there's no question King fans feel
they were cheated, even worse than usual.</TE>
<TE>   And it isn't just the fans who feel that way.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just extremely disappointed for our team," said a
still-steaming Coach Rick Adelman. "They just played their hearts out
in this series. Just seemed like they had their hearts ripped right
out of them....</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say enough about how proud I am of this group, the way
they approached every series and this series. I guess our time's got
to come some other year."</TE>
<TE>   Not that this game bore any resemblance to Game 6. The crew of
Danny Crawford, Bernie Fryer and Ed F. Rush seemed intent on letting
the players decide, letting a lot of jostling on both sides go as
non-calls. They put Mike Bibby on the free-throw line with eight
seconds left in regulation, giving him a chance to tie the score,
after Kobe Bryant bumped him as he came to the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, someone still had to lose, meaning they wouldn't feel
too good about things in general.</TE>
<TE>   And the team that lost was called for six fouls in overtime, to
none for the winners.</TE>
<TE>   "That probably had something to do with it," said Adelman,
laconically. "It's a pretty good number. Of course, we did have to
foul 'em a few times [three times in the last 14 seconds, after the
Lakers went ahead]....</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's obvious what happened in Game 6, that's all I have
to say. It was very obvious. The game changed, the way it was
officiated the last two games. It's as simple as that. I mean, Shaq
gets in foul trouble. The last two, he doesn't come close to it."</TE>
<TE>   Well, look at it from their perspective. You can't play as well as
the Kings did, come as close as they did, go through what they went
through and exit smiling.</TE>
<TE>   In two weeks, they grew into a legitimate power, capable of
playing the mighty Lakers on even terms under any circumstance, on
the Lakers' floor, with O'Neal on top of his game.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest lead the Lakers had after Game 1 was seven points.
Meanwhile, the Kings led by 15 in Game 2, 27 in Game 3, 24 in Game 4,
10 in Game 5, seven in Game 6 and nine in the third quarter of
Sunday's Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, who just turned 24, happened before the Lakers' eyes, and
the Kings turned into Bibby's team. Short and slight at 6-0, 185,
Bibby is no physical prodigy but he had always been cerebral and
efficient. In the last three weeks, however, he added something new
to his game: stardom.</TE>
<TE>   He averaged 23 points in this series, winning Game 5 with a
20-foot jumper, coming back with 29 Sunday, including 10 of the
Kings' last 12 in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Then he made two more shots in the overtime, giving the Kings
their last two leads at 104-102 and 106-104.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike had a coming-out party in the playoffs," Laker Coach Phil
Jackson said. "He's a bona fide star and he's getting bona-fide-star
calls. But he played great and he hit clutch shots."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who isn't one to shower opponents with praise, even went
so far as to observe the Kings "deserved to win" Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Funny, that's how the Kings saw it, too.</TE>
<TE>   Until very recently, they were Chris Webber's team, but the series
suggested, as had Webber's career, that while he may do many
things--he had 20 points, 11 assists, eight rebounds and two blocks
Sunday--making shots at the end of the game isn't one of his
strengths.</TE>
<TE>   Since he now has the cold-blooded, sharp-shooting Bibby to help,
this isn't the problem for the Kings that it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been worn out, OK?" bristled Adelman when asked about
Webber's six points after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Webber's the reason we're here and the reason we could win
this series....</TE>
<TE>   "We had so many guys grow up during this time frame. You know,
we're not going away. I guarantee that. We're not going away."</TE>
<TE>   However, like the good East teams that kept running into Michael
Jordan's Bulls in the '90s, the Kings are a promising young
powerhouse in the same conference with a budding dynasty, so good
luck.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Kings are really up for the challenge now.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody could have won this series," said Adelman. "If you want
to say they're the better team, you say it but I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   See you next year, same place, same time, it looks like.</TE>

<HD>Kona Gold Sharp</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The national sprint division got a big boost Sunday at Hollywood Park
with the return of Kona Gold.</LD>
<LD>   Making his first start since Nov. 17, the 8-year-old gelding
looked like his old self in capturing the $107,500 Los Angeles
Handicap, beating 2-1 second choice No Armistice and four others.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-5 favorite and 125-pound highweight, Kona Gold earned his
first Hollywood Park victory in only his second start at the track.
He hadn't been seen in Inglewood since he was a distant second to
Regal Thunder in his career debut more than four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Taking advantage of an extremely quick pace (21 2/5 and 43 4/5 for
the half-mile), the son of Java Gold and jockey Alex Solis moved up
along the rail around the turn, swung out into the stretch and from
there it was only a question of how much he was going to win by and
the final time. The margin was 1 1/4 lengths, but Solis had taken a
hold of the veteran approaching the wire and the six furlongs were
completed in 1:08 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Bruce Headley for a partnership that includes himself
and Andrew and Irwin Molasky, Kona Gold earned his 13th win in 24
starts and pushed his earnings to $2,133,864.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on how the horse came out of the race, Headley indicated
Kona Gold could make another appearance at Hollywood Park in the
$300,000 Triple Bend Handicap at seven furlongs July 6.</TE>
<TE>   If not, he will head to his favorite track--Del Mar--with the
primary goal being another win in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. Kona Gold
won the race in 2000, then was seventh as the 7-2 favorite in last
year's renewal at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   "He proved that he wasn't losing a step," said Headley. "He had
tailed off last year, he'd had enough racing. Freshening him up did
do him good. There's nothing like the pressure of a race to see if he
will run really truly run in the stretch, which he did."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. had gone a long time between victories in
the Cinderella Stakes at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Before an upset win on 11-1 shot Magic Smoke on Sunday earlier in
the Sunday card, the world's winningest rider had not won the
ungraded race for 2-year-old fillies since scoring with Tourulla in
1978.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Cinderella did disappear from the Hollywood Park
stakes schedule for 14 years before being resurrected in 1996, but
Pincay's win did continue a trend.</TE>
<TE>   A different rider has now won the Cinderella the last seven years,
thanks to Magic Smoke winning by 1 1/4 lengths over 5-2 second choice
Little Bit Of Swiss in 1:04 3/5 for the 5 1/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Global Finance, the 13-10 favorite won the Nursery Stakes three
weeks ago, finished last.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>They once were a national joke, a civic disgrace.</LD>
<LD>   Well, they would have been a civic disgrace except the locals
followed them with a collegiate-like passion, selling out Arco Arena
night after night in spite of the bad basketball they was played
there.</LD>
<LD>   But the snickering (and an eight-season playoff drought) soon
ended when Geoff Petrie became the King general manager before the
1994-95 season. It took time, but Petrie assembled the cast of
characters that pushed the Lakers to a Game 7 in the Western
Conference finals.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings lost Sunday to the Lakers, but there was a sense that
this is only the beginning for Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest thing about it is seeing these guys have this kind
of success," Petrie said. "I've told this story before, but at the
beginning, you're just trying to get better, then you trying to win
with some guys you hope you can keep together for a while. You try to
grow and you go from there. How do you imagine that [the team is
fighting for a chance to play in its first NBA Finals in more than 50
years?]"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Rick Adelman sounded a defiant tone in his closing news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going away, I can guarantee you that," he said. "You
saw how much we grew this season. You saw how we grew individually.
We had so many guys grow up this year."</TE>
<TE>   When someone asked if he believed the Kings had proved they are as
strong as the Lakers with their showing in the series, Adelman grew
testier.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't think we have enough quality?" Adelman asked. "I think
we played that team right down to the wire. You want to say they're a
better team, go ahead."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now that Mike Bibby has had a taste of playoff experience, he
wants more.</TE>
<TE>   "This loss really hurts big, but I think that we have many more
years of this to come," he said after scoring 29 points, including 14
of the Kings' last 18. "We played a great series. We should have
closed it out when we had a chance to close it out. We played the
best we could, but it wasn't enough."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was only one reason the Kings lost Sunday, according to
center Vlade Divac--16-of-30 free-throw shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't recall ever having a night like tonight, where we
collectively as a team missed so many free throws," said Divac, who
made five of 10 before fouling out.</TE>
<TE>   Added guard Bobby Jackson: "Nobody is going to win a game when you
are shooting 30 free throws and make only 16 of them. That's how the
ball rolls sometimes."</TE>

<LD>After several days of debate regarding the officiating, Shaquille
O'Neal was called for three fouls in 51 minutes. Vlade Divac fouled
out in 27 minutes and Scot Pollard had four in 20 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal declined comment on the officiating afterward, and it was
not a topic in the postgame locker rooms. Danny Crawford, Bernie
Fryer and Eddie Rush called 25 fouls on the Lakers, 30 on the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   While dozens of shady media personnel filed into the Laker locker
room before Game 7, General Manager Mitch Kupchak stood outside,
looking sheepish.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak had misplaced his credential, and the security guard would
not allow him to pass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five times the Lakers had the drawstrings on their Nike shorts
break during the series, lately with nearly disastrous implications.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry played several possessions in Game 5, a one-point
loss for the Lakers, with his shorts nearly falling off him. First he
held the shorts up with one hand, then had them taped.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 7, Kobe Bryant's drawstring snapped in the second quarter,
forcing him out of the game for nearly one minute. Also, in the third
quarter, Horry's broke again, and he changed them during free throws
by Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the Nike shorts, rather than having one
drawstring, the company made them with two, each sewn into the back
of the waist. One tug and one or both sides can break free, and the
waist is not sufficiently elastic to keep them up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker owner Jerry Buss sat in the first row on the baseline next
to the Laker bench. Next to him, a man in a purple and black jersey
rang a cowbell, non-stop.</TE>
<TE>   In an Arco Arena hallway after Sunday's victory, Buss was ready to
rank it as one of the best in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been at this 23 years now, I've had some good ones, some bad
ones, mostly good ones," he said. "They have been in the final 12 of
the 23 years. That tells you how many of these I've watched. Just for
an even game, not knowing who's going to win one way or the other,
you'd have to say this ranks up there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker assistant Frank Hamblen, 55, is being mentioned as a
coaching candidate in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Nugget General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe has not yet asked the
Lakers for permission to speak to Hamblen, who served on Phil
Jackson's staffs in Chicago from 1996-98, and in Los Angeles since
1999.</TE>

<HD>An Epic Hurdle</HD>
<DH>It takes overtime in Game 7 for Lakers to get past the
Kings and into Finals again</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>After the minor dramas, the bouts with boredom, and the many nights
they limped when they could not run, the Lakers not only returned to
the NBA Finals, they were only five minutes late.</LD>
<LD>   They defeated the Sacramento Kings, 112-106, in overtime Sunday
night at Arco Arena, won the Western Conference finals in seven games
and will play the New Jersey Nets in a best-of-seven series beginning
Wednesday night at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   When it appeared these Lakers would not leave the wake they did in
their previous two championship seasons, they became the first Laker
team to win a Game 7 on the road, in the first overtime Game 7 ever
played in the conference finals.</LD>
<TE>   They'll play the Nets to become the fifth team to win at least
three consecutive championships, after Shaquille O'Neal scored 35
points and Kobe Bryant scored 30.</TE>
<TE>   It was, as it turned out, still about the Lakers, still about what
they do to the NBA, not what it does to them. Down, three games to
two, in the series, the Lakers won the next two games, both behind a
resurgent O'Neal. Afterward, when the Lakers had eliminated the
Kings, perhaps the best team they'd seen in their 11 consecutive
postseason series, O'Neal said there are truths to understand.</TE>
<TE>   "They felt it was their time," O'Neal said. "It was not their
time."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers scored the final eight points of overtime, on a short
turn-around jumper by O'Neal and then two free throws each by O'Neal,
Derek Fisher and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   From a 106-104 lead, the Kings missed five shots and committed two
turnovers, the first when Hedo Turkoglu forced a pass that Bryant
poked away from Chris Webber, the second when Robert Horry deflected
another pass. Already the Kings had missed 14 of 30 free-throw
attempts, could not hold a one-point lead with 38 seconds left in
regulation or a two-point lead with two minutes left in the overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Already they had been overrun by O'Neal for going on two games,
and by the end he was being defended by Webber, Vlade Divac having
fouled out. One win from eliminating the Lakers for two games over
five days, the Kings went out hard, with their heads fallen and their
shoulders sagging.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great feeling, because we were able to fight back,"
Bryant said. "The Kings, they were playing excellent basketball. They
were playing better basketball than we were."</TE>
<TE>   And then one of the great--and longest--series in NBA history was
done, and Bryant fell into O'Neal's arms. He had played 52 minutes,
equaling his career high. O'Neal played 51.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant found Mike Bibby, who all but wrecked them all for 16 days,
and held him too, and whispered what a wonderful player he was, and
told Bibby that he knew what made him take big shots, and make big
shots, in the biggest moments.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby scored 29 points, four in the overtime, 12 in the fourth
quarter. With 2:58 left, Bibby made an open jumper from about 19
feet. He brought the Kings to within 91-90. Coach Phil Jackson
stormed from the Laker bench and shouted for a timeout and then
screamed at his players twice.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant threw a towel at the bench, and Horry and Jackson stood
tensely for a moment on the floor, Jackson punctuating his words by
pointing to the spot where Bibby made his shot, Horry doing the same.
He had that effect on them, until he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he a free agent?" Rick Fox asked, laughing. "Can we get him?
Dr. Buss, can we spend the money? That cat is good."</TE>
<TE>   Horry, who had made the game-winning three-pointer in Game 4 and
had 16 points and 12 rebounds here, stood at mid-court and fired a
salute into the crowd, his smile as crooked as his gait.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who had called out the Kings in the days before the series,
pulled his jersey over his head and whipped it in the air. He had a
playoff career-high 14 rebounds, and was aggressive to the basket on
a few late possessions when the Lakers leaned toward timid.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew eventually it was going to turn into a dog fight," Fox
said. "I've had a lot bottled up for the last seven games. In the
sense that I've had to listen to a lot of comments about where the
Lakers were, the fact that we've been outplayed. And, at times, we
have been. But in this locker room, we believed that we could gather
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, who had a difficult series defending Bibby and shooting,
made all four of his free throws in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   And that was it. The Lakers were back in the Finals. Half an hour
later, the only people in the arena wore gold, and they leaned over
ropes held by security guards, and yelled happily at Lakers as they
walked past and waved.</TE>
<TE>   Seven games hadn't been enough to drive an NBA Finals stake
between them. They needed five more minutes, one more period in a
season that wouldn't go easily, wouldn't die without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   The sweat soaked through everything. During timeouts, one Maloof
or another, the Kings' owners, would dart a few feet from their
front-row seats to pluck scraps of paper from the floor. Laker owner
Jerry Buss would lean slightly forward, then rock backward.</TE>
<TE>   No one sat and no one laughed and almost no one made eye contact.
In the final two minutes of regulation, the lead changed hands four
times. Bibby made a jumper for a 94-93 lead, and then Horry made a
three-pointer from the top for a 96-94 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Divac made a put-back of a Turkoglu miss for a 96-96 tie, and then
Bryant made one of two free-throw attempts with 46.3 seconds left,
for a 97-96 lead. Divac fouled out on a loose-ball scramble, sending
Bryant to the line, forcing the Kings to defend O'Neal with Webber
for however long it would take to determine a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby then made a 20-footer, even as O'Neal and Bryant charged at
him, for a one-point King lead, and Bryant made two free throws for a
Laker lead. O'Neal made one free throw and Bibby made two, tying the
score at 100, giving the ball to the Lakers with 8.2 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal missed a 14-footer and Bryant and Horry both missed taps
around the rim before the buzzer sounded.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say," O'Neal said later, "that it was grueling."</TE>

<TE>   Lakers vs. Nets</TE>
<TE>   Two games between New Jersey and the Lakers this season:</TE>
<TE>   MARCH 5, 2002: at Lakers 101, New Jersey 92--Shaquille O'Neal had
40 points and 12 rebounds and Derek Fisher scored 16 points off the
bench as the Lakers won without Kobe Bryant, who was serving the
second game of a two-game suspension for fighting with Indiana's
Reggie Miller. The Lakers' starting backcourt was Lindsey Hunter and
Mitch Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   APRIL 3, 2002: at New Jersey 94, Lakers 92--The Nets took
advantage of Shaquille O'Neal's injury-related absence and led by as
many as 19 points in the first half. But they trailed, 86-80, with
6:45 remaining before going on a 9-2 run to take the lead for good.
The Lakers started Samaki Walker at center and Slava Medvedenko at
forward.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forwards: The Lakers got clutch shooting from power forward Robert
Horry to win Game 4 against the Kings, but he is averaging only nine
points in the playoffs. He did a credible job of defending
Sacramento's Chris Webber. Small forward Rick Fox also is averaging
nine points. They will be asked to muzzle the Nets' forwards, mainly
Kenyon Martin and Keith Van Horn. Martin is a physical presence who
has a short fuse. He will be a handful for Horry. Fox will have a
tougher time with Van Horn than he did against the inconsistent Hedo
Turkoglu and the injured Peja Stojakovic in the conference final. Van
Horn runs hot and cold, but had a fine series against the Boston
Celtics.</LD>
<LD>   Center: Shaquille O'Neal should throttle Net center Todd
MacCulloch, a 7-footer from Canada who has neither the savvy nor the
skills of Sacramento's Vlade Divac. O'Neal is, as ever, the key to
the series. The Nets must find a way to at least keep him from
scoring 40 or 50 points. New Jersey will probably have Aaron Williams
beat up on him when MacCulloch is on the bench or, more likely, in
foul trouble. Williams is 6-feet-9 and weighs 225 pounds, which would
leave him at a disadvantage against the 7-1 and probably closer to
375-pound O'Neal.</LD>
<TE>   Guards: The intrigue in this series is in the backcourt. Derek
Fisher did an OK job on Portland's Damon Stoudamire, then was run
ragged by San Antonio's Tony Parker and shredded by Sacramento's Mike
Bibby. New Jersey's Jason Kidd was the pick of many MVP voters, if
for no other reason than he improved the Nets to the point that they
are in their first NBA Finals since joining the league in 1976-77.
The Nets' deal to get Kidd from the Phoenix Suns for Stephon Marbury
was the steal of last summer. Fisher won't have to worry as much
about Kidd pulling up for jump shots. He plays a different style from
Bibby, preferring to drive and pass to open teammates when the
defense collapses on him. Kerry Kittles is having a career season,
but he's no match for Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching: The Zen-master meets the former Laker. Phil Jackson has
the Lakers poised for a three-peat. Byron Scott, having dispatched
the hated Celtics, has the Nets where they haven't been since Julius
Erving was leading them to the American Basketball Assn. title in
1976, when the franchise was in Uniondale, N.Y. Jackson's teams have
won eight NBA titles. A season ago, Scott's team won 26 games.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis: The Lakers would seem to have all the edges except at
point guard, but what else is new? Their experience helped them carry
the day against the Kings and should do so again against the upstart
Nets. O'Neal cannot be stopped by the Nets, although they will
probably beat on him in an attempt to throw him off his game. Bryant
will prove to be a handful.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Lakers in six.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Los Angeles, the land of high-priced real estate, it is all about
location, location and location.</LD>
<LD>   For L.A. Laker fans, there is no more valuable piece of real
estate than five feet from the basket, with the ball in Shaquille
O'Neal's hands.</LD>
<LD>   So the Lakers, and their coach, Phil Jackson, finally closed
escrow on the Sacramento Kings on Sunday by creating clever ways to
get O'Neal to the spot, get him the ball and make sure that he was
able to establish, beyond anyone's doubt, that this was his domicile.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers got the ball in to O'Neal in a variety of ways:</TE>
<TE>   * With the pick and roll;</TE>
<TE>   * By swinging it from side to side and entering in to O'Neal from
the second, or even, third side;</TE>
<TE>   * By starting him up high, then having him hand off and dive low
for the return pass.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were creative and patient, especially in the second
half. This way, they beat the Shaq Pack, the Sacramento collapse that
had Vlade Divac behind him, Chris Webber in front and everybody else
close by collapsing. Part of it is making sure that you stretch the
defense, and every time Robert Horry made a three-pointer or even
Derek Fisher sank one at the end, the Shaq Pack has to stop packing
so much and stretch out to go get the shooters.</TE>
<TE>   With O'Neal moving constantly to that valuable piece of real
estate, the Lakers, once they settled down and got patient and used
more of the clock, would pass the ball in, get it back out and then
pass it in immediately. There would be a passing cadence, almost like
a dance step. Like this: In, back out, back in. In, back out, back
in. Then, when that started to be defended, the cadence would change
to: in, back out, swing to the other side, in, back out, in.</TE>
<TE>   This was a series that left both teams breathless, not to mention
the fans of both teams. It was a series that tested both coaches, and
both clearly passed.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Adelman did his best to get the Lakers to play too fast, out
of their tempo. And he got great results from his picking and rolling
and two-man games, all triggered by Mike Bibby, who came of age in
this seven-game endurance test. I was especially impressed that
Adelman did not play the Peja Stojakovic card, that he did not make
the injury to a key player an issue, or an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson countered and adjusted nicely every game. He never let his
team get caught up too long in Sacramento fastball. And, at moments,
like the one Sunday in the timeout where he yelled at Horry, Jackson
was really the Zen Master. He was angry at O'Neal, so he yelled at
Horry, who yelled back. The message was passed, although not directly
to the person needing to receive it. But think about it. Would you
yell at O'Neal? Would any sane person?</TE>
<TE>   Here is perhaps a key difference, or maybe THE key difference, in
this series. O'Neal is a franchise player who is the fulcrum of his
team, who passes when appropriate but looks to shoot every time it is
needed. Webber is a designated franchise player, who is paid to be
one and expected to do what one does, but one who looks to pass
before he looks to shoot and who is content with sharing the ball,
rather than scoring at the key moments. NBC's Peter Vescey calls him
the "Fake Franchise Player," which may be a bit harsh.</TE>
<TE>   This was a series of ifs, ands and buts. Let's toy with the order.</TE>
<TE>   "If" Stojakovic were healthy throughout ...</TE>
<TE>   "But" for horrible free-throw shooting by Sacramento in Game 7 ...</TE>
<TE>   "And" despite all the cow bells and close games and talk about
dynasties ending, the Lakers are still the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Majerus, Utah basketball coach, will be The Times' guest
analyst on the Lakers for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the
fourth-winningest active coach in major college basketball, will
begin his 14th season at Utah this fall.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Learns From Mistakes</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rookie Jimmie Johnson redeemed himself for errors that probably cost
him a victory a week earlier, winning the MBNA Platinum 400 on Sunday
at Dover International Speedway in Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   Despite dominating the middle part of the race, Johnson was 10th
after most of the contenders stopped for gas for the last time with
92 of 400 laps remaining. But Johnson passed four-time Dover winner
Ricky Rudd to take the lead on lap 363.</LD>
<LD>   Then, Johnson stayed on the track when a final caution waved for
Ken Schrader's blown rear end with 28 laps left.</LD>
<TE>   The others pitted for tires in hopes of catching Johnson, but he
drove away in his Chevrolet on the restart and beat the Dodge of
four-time Dover winner Bill Elliott by a half-second.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize Elliott was coming that hard, and I had to step
it back up to stay up there," Johnson said. "These guys gave me a
great race car."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second victory of the season for Johnson, whose car is
owned by Jeff Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson also had the strongest car last week in the Coca-Cola 600,
but lost after making mistakes--including overshooting his pit
stall--late in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson also moved ahead of Gordon and Mark Martin in the series
standings, and now sits second behind leader Sterling Marlin. Marlin
finished 13th Sunday and leads Johnson by 136 points after 13 of 36
races.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tracy, who lost a disputed finish in the Indianapolis 500 a
week earlier, dominated the Miller Lite 250, leading 184 of the 250
laps at the Milwaukee Mile in West Allis, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the 19th of Tracy's CART career and the first
since September 2000 in Vancouver, Canada--a span of 28 races. The
Canadian took the lead for good on lap 180 on the 1.032-mile oval
when defending race winner Kenny Brack made his final pit stop.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy finished 0.638 seconds ahead of Adrian Fernandez. Max Papis
was third, followed by Christian Fittipaldi and Michel Jourdain.
Jourdain took a 42-35 lead over Dario Franchitti in the season
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy's team owner, Barry Green, is considering filing an appeal
of his driver's second-place finish to Helio Castroneves today in
Indianapolis. Tracy's team is arguing that he passed Castroneves a
split second before a caution light blinked on and froze positions on
the next-to-last lap at Indy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dixon raced to his sixth Top Fuel victory of the year,
winning the NHRA Nationals at Route 66 Raceway at Joliet, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon defeated Kenny Bernstein in the final with a quarter-mile
run of 4.580 seconds at 319.37 mph. Bernstein finished in 4.620 at
317.72. In other division, Del Worsham topped the Funny Car
competition and Bruce Allen took the Pro Stock title.</TE>

<TE>   Drag racer Jerry Gannon died Sunday, a day after crashing at
Atlanta Dragway in Commerce, Ga. He was 50.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, of Franklin Furnace, Ohio, was driving a jet-powered Funny
Car on Saturday when his car hit a wall, then spun around and hit
another wall before flipping and bursting into flames.</TE>
<TE>   Track officials told Atlanta TV station WAGA that their fire truck
hose snapped off and got caught on an ambulance tire as they
responded.</TE>

<HD>Red Wings Wary of Favorites Role</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The nine Stanley Cup championship banners that hang in Joe Louis
Arena don't represent all the history the Carolina Hurricanes are up
against in facing the Detroit Red Wings.</LD>
<LD>   Featuring at least a half-dozen players bound for the Hall of
Fame, and a coach who's already there, Detroit has been favored all
season to capture the Cup for the first time since 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The Hurricanes, in the Stanley Cup finals for the first time,
haven't won in Detroit since the 1989-90 season, when they were the
Hartford Whalers.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Wings have won five in a row over Carolina at home and are
16-3-0-1 against the Hurricanes the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The best-of-seven series opens at Detroit on Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily for us it's 0-0 right now and that's how we're
approaching it," said Carolina's Arturs Irbe, San Jose's goalie in
1994 when the Sharks upset the heavily favored Red Wings in the
opening round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Red Wings don't expect to win in a walk--not with the
overachieving Hurricanes standing in their way.</TE>
<TE>   "Carolina's done a lot of good things to put themselves in this
position," Detroit's Kris Draper said after Sunday's practice.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not lucky to win a playoff series. And that's what they've
done in the East."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings clinched the Cup in the minds of many when they
eliminated defending champion Colorado in the Western Conference
finals--winning Game 7 on Friday, 7-0.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think what you did before has any bearing on what you're
going to do," Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman said, noting that Carolina
has won five consecutive road playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   Each team has played 18 games this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina reached its first finals by eliminating New Jersey,
Montreal and Toronto, each in six games. The Hurricanes beat the
Devils twice in overtime, the Canadiens once and the Maple Leafs
three times.</TE>

<HD>Phillie Pitcher Person Makes Grand Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Person's elbow injury sure didn't affect his swing.</LD>
<LD>   Making his first start since April 29 after going on the disabled
list because of tendinitis in his right elbow, the Philadelphia
Phillies' pitcher drove in seven runs with a grand slam and a
three-run homer in an 18-3 rout of the Montreal Expos on Sunday at
Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Person also pitched five innings for his first victory of the
season.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm still coming back to earth," he said. "I'm glad I was in that
situation. I've left a lot of guys on base before."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Burrell hit a three-run homer and a run-scoring single in a
10-run first inning for Philadelphia. Burrell finished with three
hits and five RBIs, Bobby Abreu had four runs batted in, and Marlon
Anderson had three hits and three runs scored.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies, swept in Montreal last weekend, took two of three to
win their fifth consecutive series at home. They are a major
league-worst 5-22 on the road, but 18-10 at Veterans Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Atlanta 1--Elmer Dessens pitched seven shutout
innings and Barry Larkin sparked a late rally at Cincinnati with a
three-run double off Damian Moss (2-2).</TE>
<TE>   After getting outscored, 14-1, in the first two games of the
series, the NL Central leaders relied on Dessens (4-3), a handful of
nice defensive plays and a seventh-inning rally to salvage one game
in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, St. Louis 2--Abraham Nunez drove in three runs,
including a tiebreaking RBI single in the seventh inning to lead the
Pirates at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Lowe (1-2) got two outs for the victory and Mike Williams
pitched the ninth for his 17th save.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Houston 2--Matt Clement pitched 7 2/3 strong innings,
and Moises Alou hit his first homer in a month to lead the Cubs at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Clement (4-3) gave up two runs, five hits and two walks. He struck
out six. Antonio Alfonseca gave up an RBI single to Lance Berkman in
the eighth, but got four outs for his ninth save in 10 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, New York 3--Preston Wilson drove in two runs with a
homer and a triple at Miami, and the Marlins sent Al Leiter to an
early shower for the second time in a week.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 4, San Diego 3--Jeffrey Hammonds hit a tiebreaking homer
leading off the eighth inning, and the Brewers completed a three-game
sweep at San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Ties Robinson in Giant Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds is honored his name is right up there on the home run
list with Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Willie Mays and Frank Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   But what matters now, he said, is wins.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds hit his 586th home run to tie Robinson for fourth place on
the list, and the San Francisco Giants beat the Colorado Rockies,
9-2, Sunday night at San Francisco to end a losing streak at four
games.</LD>
<TE>   "This victory means more to us right now," Bonds said. "Every team
goes through a spell where they're not hitting the ball. Today we
came together."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit a high-arching solo shot, driving a 3-2 pitch from Brian
Fuentes into the right-center bleachers in the seventh inning for his
19th homer of the season, matching the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa for
the major league lead.</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago added a three-run homer and Jason Schmidt (1-1)
pitched seven strong innings for the Giants, who beat the Rockies for
the first time in six tries this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to play to win. Right now, were in a little down
spell," Bonds said. "Hopefully we'll pick it up."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies, who won the first two games of the weekend series,
have never swept the Giants in San Francisco. Colorado lost for just
the third time in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the first inning, David Bell and Bonds singled.
Bell scored on Jeff Kent's double before Santiago's shot off John
Thomson (6-4) into the left-field bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   Kent scored Bell with a double in the third to make it 5-0.
Schmidt doubled in the fourth and scored on Reggie Sanders' single.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt gave up one run on five hits. He struck out nine. Fuentes
said he left a fastball against Bonds "a little up."</TE>
<TE>   "I got too much of the plate and he drove it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reigning National League most valuable player hit a
single-season record 73 home runs last season. With one more to go to
surpass Robinson, Bonds' next target on the list is his godfather,
Mays, who has 660. Ruth hit 714, and Aaron holds the record with 755.</TE>
<TE>   "I really appreciate what they've done for the game and I'm
honored to be in the same class," Bonds said.</TE>
<TE>   Damon Minor doubled in the fifth inning to score Bonds. Tsuyoshi
Shinjo added an RBI grounder. Thomson gave up a season-high eight
runs and 10 hits over 4 1/3 innings. He walked one and struck out
three. The Rockies scored in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Walker, back in the lineup after missing two games because
of a sore elbow, walked and scored on Todd Helton's double.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>This time, for the first time, their greatness didn't come from the
sky.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the Lakers of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal could
jump no higher, stretch no farther.</LD>
<LD>   This time, as a stomach-turning Sunday afternoon became evening,
they reached down.</LD>
<TE>   Down past the ego. Down past the glitter. Down past everything the
sports world has come to believe about a pretty basketball team that
had yet to show its soul.</TE>
<TE>   Down to a spot that perhaps even the Lakers weren't sure existed.</TE>
<TE>   "Deep," said Derek Fisher. "Deeper than we've ever dug before."</TE>
<TE>   Deep enough to find something faded, scuffed and absolutely
splendid.</TE>
<TE>   Something that looked not like a flowery Bryant jumper, but a
scrambling Bryant rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Something that sounded not like a rattling O'Neal dunk, but a
swished O'Neal free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Something that today ranks as the greatest win of their era
because, as the Lakers reminded everyone, greatness is more than just
a pretty face.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, it was a 112-106 overtime victory over the host
Sacramento Kings in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, amid Arco Arena's deafening jeers, it was a comeback
from a nine-point second-half deficit, then a comeback from a
last-second miss that would have won the game in regulation, then a
comeback from a quick King basket in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   It was Rick Fox chasing. It was Robert Horry diving. It was Fisher
on the ground and, most amazing of all, it was Phil Jackson on his
feet.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't like anyone thought it would be. It was not the power of
that Game 7 comeback against Portland, nor the style of the clinchers
against Philadelphia and Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   There was not one alley-oop. There was, in fact, a lot more alley
than oop.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, greatness was a three-hour task that left the Lakers
too breathless to smile and too weary to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't been pretty, it's not going to be pretty," said Fox.
"But we still have the heart of a champion."</TE>
<TE>   A heart that will now be transplanted to the NBA Finals, where the
Lakers will begin the final leg of their quest for a third
consecutive championship by playing, well, um, somebody.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey who? Where? When?</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   This was the title here. The winner of one of the best NBA playoff
series ever deserves at least that much.</TE>
<TE>   It was a seven-game series so spectacular, seven games couldn't
decide it.</TE>
<TE>   After 17 lead changes and 13 ties, they needed five extra minutes.
It was five minutes that finally uncovered one difference.</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings dug their deepest, they came up with only lint.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Christie threw up two awful, hesitant, clanging three-point
attempts. Chris Webber threw up four tentative misses and lost the
ball on one tentative dribble.</TE>
<TE>   Only Mike Bibby seemed to really want the ball, and even he
finally collapsed under the weight of it all.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers stood strong, there being so many of them.</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell, the Kings finally felt the pressure," said Fox.
"For us, it was different. It was like, we were right where we wanted
to be."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers wanted to be at the foul line, where the jittery Kings
missed 14 of their 30 chances while the Lakers missed only six of 33.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty sure that was pressure right there," said Samaki
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers wanted to be on the floor, where they outhustled the
Kings in nearly every important late-game situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil is over there shouting, 'Rebound! Rebound!' and we're all
getting after it," said Fox. "We realized, it was our last hurrah, if
we didn't win, we couldn't three-peat for, what, another four years?
We had to leave it all out there."</TE>
<TE>   Fox, left out for much of the series, led the third-quarter
comeback with a sequence of plays that included two offensive
rebounds, two layups, an assist and a lunging grab of a ball held at
the time by Hedo Turkoglu.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I told Chris Webber," said Bryant. "Our guys don't
budge."</TE>
<TE>   Horry, who essentially disappeared after his game-winning
three-pointer in Game 4, reappeared to grab 12 rebounds and hit the
exact same shot during one Laker run.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been playing together for five years," Horry said. "If we
don't understand what to do by now, something's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Even Fisher, obliterated by Bibby for most of the series, shoved
him to the ground during the overtime, then stood up to drive the
ball into two fouls worth four free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to believe," said Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone to do otherwise would now seem foolish. In hopes of
understanding the complex power that is the Lakers, critics,
including this one, have searched far and wide.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, there are times they need only to look deep.</TE>

<HD>Laker Arrogance Could Mean Bliss for the Nets</HD>

<LD>Jason Kidd expects that the New Jersey Nets will be huge underdogs
when the NBA Finals begin. Kidd said it didn't matter who the Nets
played, the Lakers or Kings. It didn't matter because whoever it was,
they would automatically be crowned NBA champions by most basketball
fans west of the Delaware River.</LD>
<LD>   "That would be a mistake," Kidd said. "But it's what's been
happening to us all year so what's the difference? We weren't
supposed to be the best team in the East. We weren't supposed to beat
the Celtics. We were supposed to go home after Game 3," the infamous
afternoon when the Nets blew a 26-point third-quarter lead to Boston.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got guys on this team nobody wanted or that people wrote
off," Kidd said. "We remember this stuff and we'll keep remembering."</LD>
<TE>   It is the Lakers the Nets will play. The Nets have been made
immediate 9-1 underdogs. And they should be. The Lakers won two
pressure-packed games against another great team, games that make a
team a true champion.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the problem. The Lakers will come to Staples Center
Wednesday having heard three days of noise about how the three-peat
has been three-peated, that by beating the Kings in the toughest,
most emotional and hard-fought series the NBA has been presented with
in many years, the heavy lifting is over and the victory tour is
beginning.</TE>
<TE>   This would be a mistake because the Nets have taken on Kidd's
personality.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd is the most unemotional--meaning totally controlled on the
court--leader around. Kidd will not flop or whine about foul calls,
will not frown at a missed shot, will not pump a fist or leap for joy
after a great play. Everything he feels, Kidd lets flow through his
arms, his hands, his heart and into the basketball. Mr. Triple-Double
has an unbendable will and unbreakable concentration.</TE>
<TE>   Whether his teammates can make the best use of his passes, whether
the Nets can find someone to guard Shaquille O'Neal, whether Kerry
Kittles and Keith Van Horn will hit the open jump shots Kidd will get
them, whether the bench players like Lucious Harris, Richard
Jefferson and Aaron Williams will be as productive as they were in
New Jersey's six-game Eastern Conference finals victory over the
Celtics ... all that remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   But don't dismiss the Nets. There has been an arrogance about the
Lakers this season, a feeling that playing hard all the time wasn't
necessary or worthwhile, that another title was a birthright. The
Kings proved that it isn't. The Kings showed the Lakers that a team
must play hard and well every night--and every minute.</TE>
<TE>   Will the Lakers remember this by Wednesday?</TE>
<TE>   The Nets aren't tokens. They have come together and decided the
world is against them and that the only thing to do is to keep
winning. They have gained confidence through the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd will not take it as a moral victory that the Nets doubled
their regular-season win total, from 26 last season to 52, or that
they beat the hallowed Celtics and made it to the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   He celebrated very little Friday night when the Nets clinched the
East on Boston's home court. Some players would have been
extravagantly pushing their triumph into the faces of the Boston
crowd at the FleetCenter. Members of that crowd had harassed Kidd's
wife into staying home for Game 6 and chanted ugly references to
Kidd's past.</TE>
<TE>   Some players would have danced and shimmied, jumped on a table and
waved his Net jersey in their faces.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would I want to celebrate now?" Kidd said later. "Our
business isn't finished. We've got more to accomplish. No matter what
people say, we are going to the Finals expecting to win even if no
one else thinks we can."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets will have to contend with so much doubt. Kidd is right.</TE>
<TE>   There is the history. The Lakers are Showtime, the team of bright
lights and big stars and history, great history, both distant and
recent. The Lakers are Primetime, TV darlings, the playground of Shaq
and Kobe and movie stars and glamour girl cheerleaders.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets play in an arena built on a swamp and are burdened with
so much failure. They opened their NBA history by selling Julius
Erving, the great Dr. J, to the Philadelphia 76ers for $3 million and
a handful of beads. At least that's what it seemed like. And they
sold Dr. J so they could pay off the rival Knicks for the honor of
competing in the same NBA vicinity as the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Until this season, the Nets had won only nine playoff games in
their NBA time and never a series.</TE>
<TE>   This will all be noted by Laker fans. This will all be rehashed on
talk radio this week. The Nets will be mocked. They'll be mocked for
drafting Kittles instead of Kobe Bryant. They'll be mocked for
playing just off a New Jersey turnpike exit, for having no identity
except as bottom feeders.</TE>
<TE>   It might be wise for the Lakers to listen to others. Listen to
Kenyon Martin, Net forward, talk about Kidd:</TE>
<TE>   "He is going to give you everything he has. He might go out and
not make his shots but he'll lead us in rebounding and get the big
steal and then, right at the end, make the key shot."</TE>
<TE>   When Martin talks about Kidd, he is talking about himself too. And
his teammates. A tough bunch and not to be ignored.</TE>

<KH>FIGURE SKATING</KH>
<HD>Officials Consider Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KYOTO, Japan</DL>
<LD>The International Skating Union took the first step toward reforming
figure skating's judging and scoring systems by unanimously agreeing
Monday to consider all 49 "urgent proposals" put forth by the ISU
itself and member federations.</LD>
<LD>   The extent and nature of those reforms, however, will be hotly
debated as the organization's biennial Congress continues this week.
The full congress is expected to decide Wednesday morning, Japan
time, whether it will go forward with dramatic change. If the
Congress agrees to a reform proposal, figure skating delegates would
meet separately from their speedskating counterparts to discuss the
nature of the changes. "If not, I say, 'OK, it is a sad moment," ISU
President Ottavio Cinquanta said.</LD>
<LD>   In a 14-page speech to representatives from 53 nations, Cinquanta
acknowledged "there is a problem" with figure skating's current
judging system. But he disputed the perception that a judging scandal
at the Salt Lake City Olympics had undermined the sport's integrity.</LD>
<TE>   "This, dear delegates, is not only an accusation, it is also a
grave insult, since we know by far that the majority of the
competitions are judged with fairness," he said. "Of course, we
cannot exclude that there are mistakes, but being accused of lacking
credibility is certainly not the way to say that a judge has made a
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "What has become evident, and I would like to stress to you today,
is that it is not possible to maintain a system of judging created
decades ago ... that is no longer comparable with today's standards
of skating. We cannot sacrifice the effort and dedication of skaters,
coaches, clubs, federations, families by maintaining an outdated
system of judging that does not reflect the merit of the on-ice
performance and unfortunately, in some cases, can permit misconduct."</TE>
<TE>   In the first sign some change is imminent, the Congress adopted
without dissent a proposal to have judges renominated by the ISU at
the end of their terms, based on a rating of their performance by the
ISU technical committee. Previously, judges were renominated by their
respective national federations. That created an opportunity for
federations to pressure judges, because nominations and assignments
are considered perks. A similar proposal was rejected two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first positive step," said Fredi Schmid, the ISU's
general secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Any changes must be approved by a two-thirds vote of members
present. Such consensus might be difficult to achieve on major
issues, such as the notion of discarding the traditional 6.0 perfect
score, as advocated by the ISU.</TE>

<TE>   Update--There are two players from the Sparks' 2001 WNBA
championship team that have not received their rings yet. Ukari
Figgs, who was traded in the off-season to Portland, is supposed to
receive hers tonight. Figgs is hurting after losing a front tooth as
a result of a collision with teammate Jackie Stiles during Sunday's
loss to Seattle. (The other player, Rhonda Mapp, is suspended because
of a contract dispute and will probably have her ring mailed to her.)
Los Angeles is hoping to rebound from Saturday's overtime loss in
Charlotte. The 94 points were the most the Sting has scored against
the Sparks. The best news out of North Carolina was the announced
engagement of rookie Nikki Teasley--who has replaced Figgs in the
Sparks' lineup--to Collis Arrick, a banker in Raleigh, N.C. Arrick
proposed last Friday when the couple was watching the Laker game.</TE>

<HD>A Second-Half Disappearing Act</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>At the end, he was all but invisible, a victim (perhaps) of point
guard Mike Bibby's success and (certainly) of center Vlade Divac's
foul trouble. The Sacramento Kings sure could have used more from
power forward Chris Webber when it counted Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   They didn't get it.</LD>
<LD>   Webber scored 20 points, took eight rebounds and had 11 assists in
what otherwise might have been hailed as a fine game. Trouble was,
Webber went poof! in the second half. And the Kings did, too, falling
to the Lakers, 112-106, in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals at
raucous Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   In the second half plus overtime, Webber scored six points on
three-of-10 shooting, took four rebounds and, remarkably enough,
turned into a playmaker with seven assists. He took one shot in the
third quarter, four in the fourth and five in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, Webber had the look of a beaten man, wondering
where it all went wrong. The trouble began when center Vlade Divac
went to the bench with his fourth foul with 5:29 remaining in the
third quarter. The Kings had a 65-58 lead at that point, but it would
not last.</TE>
<TE>   Backup Scot Pollard couldn't handle Laker center Shaquille O'Neal
in the low post after Divac went out. When Divac returned, he picked
up his fifth and sixth fouls and was gone. Webber was asked to shadow
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our big guys got in foul trouble and I started checking
O'Neal," Webber said, trying to explain his sudden lack of shooting
after halftime. "I'm not going to post him up. I'm going to try to
move my feet and set up my other guys. It was working. It just didn't
work enough."</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, Bibby became the Kings' only option with the ball.
Bibby and Webber ran pick and roll after pick and roll, with Webber
freeing Bibby repeatedly for open shots. Against increasing pressure
from the Lakers, he kept hitting, scoring 14 of the Kings' final 18
points.</TE>
<TE>   Webber was a non-factor, although he did make a jumper for the
first points of overtime. Webber missed his next four, including a
three-point attempt that could have brought the Kings within,
110-109, in the closing seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not concerned about who is taking shots," Sacramento Coach
Rick Adelman said when asked about Webber's inactivity late. "That's
for somebody else to discuss. Chris Webber was the reason we were
here."</TE>
<TE>   Webber wasn't the only reason the Kings are on vacation today
while the Lakers prepare to meet the New Jersey Nets in the NBA
Finals, which begin Wednesday at Staples Center. He was only the most
noticeable reason. Plus, his second-half disappearance served to
underscore the Kings' lack of experience in crunch time.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Kings, only reserve forward Chucky Brown has won a
championship ring, earned with the Houston Rockets in 1995-96. Webber
asked Brown to show off his ring to the Kings before the playoffs
began, as a way to displaying what it was that they were after in
this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, on the eve of Game 7, Webber spoke of the pressure he
might face. Sunday, he was almost tearful as he spoke of what the
experience meant to him.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be back here again," he said. "Positives are going to come
out of this. Flowers grow from manure. Anything can grow from
anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll keep playing and stay positive. I'll be proud of my effort.
I know the Kings came to play. I know the Kings deserved to win the
series."</TE>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Bruce Arena, the U.S. coach, said he would make up his mind Sunday
night about whether to start Kasey Keller or Brad Friedel in goal in
the opening game against Portugal and let the players know his
decision today.</LD>
<LD>   That doesn't mean anyone else will find out until game time on
Wednesday, however. "We are very close to finalizing our lineup,"
Arena said. "No, we will not be disclosing our lineup."</LD>
<LD>   He did give a broad hint that midfielder Claudio Reyna could be
involved in more of a defensive role than an offensive one, which
suggests that Reyna might take on the defensive midfield position
once occupied by injured Chris Armas, thereby freeing John O'Brien to
start in left midfield in place of DaMarcus Beasley.</LD>
<TE>   Such a move might also open a place for Landon Donovan in the
starting lineup, either as the attacking midfielder or as an
out-and-out forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Claudio has grown considerably since 1998," Arena said. "One area
where he is clearly now an outstanding player is on the defensive end
of the field.</TE>
<TE>   "He positions himself well, he is good in the tackle and he is
very responsible on the defensive side of the ball. [And] obviously,
he is a good player in helping us keep position, he is a good passer
and he helps settle our team down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Portuguese are champing at the bit to get started, according
to forward Nuno Gomes.</TE>
<TE>   "Watching other teams playing on television just increases the
anxiety and the will to start our World Cup campaign," he told
Reuters. "We know we are the favorites [to win Group D, which also
includes South Korea and Poland], but we have to prove it on the
field."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arena does not believe FIFA's system of ranking teams should be
taken seriously, at least not as an indicator of what might happen
when the U.S. plays higher-ranked Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "If we based everything on rankings, then there is no point in
playing," he said. "If I understand it correctly, this time around at
the World Cup we still have to go on the field and play."</TE>

<BD>From the Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Liberty turned up its defense in its home opener to fuel
a late run that beat Miami, 58-52, Sunday at Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   With the game tied, 52-52, New York forced two turnovers and a
shot-clock violation to hold the Sol scoreless in the final three
minutes. Crystal Robinson led the Liberty (3-1) with 16 points.
Tamika Whitmore had 12 points, including four in the final 6-0 run.
Sandy Brondello, who sat out the preseason with foot and quadriceps
injuries, led the Sol (0-3) with 17 points. Miami center Ruth Riley
will sit out at least four weeks because of a broken right finger.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle 57, Portland 47--Sue Bird had 14 points and five assists
as Seattle (1-1) held on to beat host Portland (0-3), which got one
point from Jackie Stiles. Sylvia Crawley's 16 points led the Fire
(0-3).</LD>
<TE>   Indiana 78, Detroit 65--Tamika Catchings scored 27 points and
Nikki McCray added 21 as the Fever (2-0) spoiled the Shock's home
opener at Auburn Hills, Mich. Catchings was 12 for 12 from the
free-throw line. Wendy Palmer's 16 points led Detroit (0-3).</TE>

<HD>England Starts on Bad Foot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner; Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With England needing 90 minutes of David Beckham against Sweden and
nothing less, the most famous foot in Britain balked at about the
hour mark Sunday in Saitama, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   What that left England, in a 1-1 World Cup-opening draw, was
everything England had feared since that foot was broken seven weeks
ago.</LD>
<LD>   In the 24th minute, Beckham curled in a perfect corner and Sol
Campbell rose to head the ball powerfully past Sweden goalkeeper
Magnus Hedman. England was in the lead and comfortably in control of
the match.</LD>
<TE>   But as the second half rolled on and Beckham began to tire,
England fell back on its heels. Sweden began attacking in surges,
English defender Danny Mills botched a simple clearance and when the
ball fell to Niclas Alexandersson at the top of the penalty area, the
score was suddenly tied in the 59th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Four minutes later, England Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson substituted
Beckham--and soon the rest of the world realized why all of England
had been so hysterical about the condition of that fractured
metatarsal.</TE>
<TE>   Without Beckham, England looked in disarray--unable to maintain
possession, unable to get the ball to striker Michael Owen, unable to
do much of anything, including basic defending.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden swarmed, again and again, and only two outstanding saves by
England goalkeeper David Seaman kept Teddy Lucic from winning the
match for the Swedes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a draw is a fair result," Eriksson said after his players
staggered off the field, still without a victory over Sweden since
1968.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mixed feelings about the result," Sweden Co-Coach Lars
Lagerback countered. "We created some good chances in the second half
and with a bit of luck we could have won it ... It's an OK result."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Penner</TE>
<TE>   Argentina 1, Nigeria 0--Another African nation tried to take down
a tournament co-favorite, but Argentina, unlike France against
Senegal, had all of its best attackers on the field against
Nigeria--and one, Gabriel Batistuta, at the right place at the right
time.</TE>
<TE>   Batistuta's angled header from a 63rd-minute corner provided the
difference in Argentina's 1-0 victory at Irabaki, Japan, and moved
Argentina alone atop the Group F standings with three points. England
and Sweden are tied for second with one point each.</TE>
<TE>   The corner, delivered by Argentine captain Juan Veron, enabled
Batistuta to maintain his goal-a-game pace at the World Cup.
Batistuta has now scored 10 goals in 10 World Cup games--and has
scored in each of the 1994, 1998 and 2002 tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Argentina Coach Marcelo Bielsa was less than excited. "It
should have bigger," he said, referring to the one-goal difference.</TE>
<TE>   Bielsa had a point. The only thing depriving Argentina of a
deserved two- or three-goal victory was the exceptional play of
Nigerian goalkeeper Ike Shorunmu.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can do better," said Nigeria midfielder JayJay Okocha.
"It was the first game and it wasn't easy. We lost by 1-0, which is
not a disgrace. I think we should be proud of it."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Penner</TE>
<TE>   Spain 3, Slovenia 1--Spain got its World Cup off to a confident,
if controversial, start Sunday with an impressive 3-1 victory over
Slovenia in front of 28,598 fans in Gwangju, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Raul, one minute before halftime, and Juan Valeron, in
the 74th minute, put the Spanish in command. But Sebastijan Cimirotic
pulled one back for Slovenia in the 82nd minute and it was not until
Fernando Hierro netted a penalty kick five minutes later that Spain
was safe.</TE>
<TE>   The victory marked the first time in more than half a century that
Spain had won its opening World Cup match. The last time it did so
was against the United States in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Slovenia, making its World Cup debut, was left angry by two
decisions made by Moroccan referee Mohammed Guezzaz late in the game,
first when he denied Slovenia a penalty kick after Milenko Acimovic
was knocked down in the box by Spanish defender Miguel Angel Nadal
and second when he awarded Spain a penalty for an innocuous challenge
on Fernando Morientes by Sasa Gajser.</TE>
<TE>   Hierro scored his 28th goal for Spain as a result of the latter
call.</TE>
<TE>   Grahame L. Jones</TE>
<TE>   South Africa 2, Paraguay 2--South Africa left it until the last
minute before completing a surprise comeback to tie Paraguay in front
of a disappointing crowd of only 25,186 in the South Korean port city
of Busan.</TE>
<TE>   Quinton Fortune's goal off a rather generously awarded penalty
kick in injury time secured a point for South Africans in the Group B
encounter that appeared to be going the South Americans' way.</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay took the lead after 39 minutes when Roque Santa Cruz
headed a cross from Francisco Arce past South African goalkeeper
Andre Arendse.</TE>
<TE>   In the 55th minute, Arce scored on a superb curling free kick into
the upper left corner of Arendse's net and Paraguay, playing without
suspended goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, appeared set for victory.</TE>
<TE>   Things came unraveled when Paraguay defender Estanislao Struway
accidentally deflected a shot by Aaron Mokoena into his own net in
the 63rd minute, and Fortune saved South Africa after referee Michel
Lubos of Slovakia ruled that Paraguay goalkeeper Ricardo Tavarelli
had fouled Sibusio Zuma and awarded a penalty kick in the 90th
minute.</TE>
