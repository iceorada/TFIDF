<HD>The Money Game</HD>
<DH>Bowl games covet teams such as Notre Dame because they
'travel well,' meaning lots of free-spending fans in the stands</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone's fighting over the Fighting Irish.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind all the sports polls and rankings naming the University
of Miami as the nation's top college football team. Anyone planning a
bowl game in California this year knows that Notre Dame is No. 1 --
because the real action is in tourism, not football.</LD>
<LD>   To bowl organizers and economic development officials, it's the
players in the grandstands -- rather than the ones on the gridiron --
that matter most.</LD>
<TE>   They want teams from cold weather climes and ones that have ardent
followers who will jam hotels and restaurants as they swarm the
Golden State to take in the sunshine as well as the battle on the
field.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame, with a nationwide network of wealthy and rabid fans,
is one of the dream teams, along with Nebraska, Ohio State, Michigan
and some of the football-crazy schools of the South.</TE>
<TE>   College football teams will play in 28 bowl games this season, up
from 25 last season. The first matches two mediocre teams from
lesser-known conferences in the New Orleans Bowl on Dec. 17.</TE>
<TE>   The action builds to a six-game New Year's Day bonanza that
includes the granddaddy of them all, the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The season ends with a matchup of the two top-ranked teams in the
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame is not a member of any conference, but the bowl system
makes allowances for that. During a winning season, Notre Dame will
always get some bowl bid. If it wins nine games -- as it has this
season -- and is one of the top teams in the nation, it's guaranteed
to get in one of the four big-money Bowl Championship Series games.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if Notre Dame beats USC on Saturday, it would win a berth
in either the Rose, Orange or Sugar Bowl. In the end, chances are
slim that Notre Dame will appear in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But Rose Bowl officials remain giddy at the prospect. "Clearly
there is an economic component working to have Notre Dame in a bowl,"
said Mitchell Dorger, chief executive of the Tournament of Roses,
which puts on the Rose Bowl and the Rose Parade. "They bring a lot of
fans, they fill hotels, they fill restaurants, and they buy a lot of
bowl merchandise and other goods."</TE>
<TE>   That's in contrast to what happened last season. Miami is a
perennial powerhouse when judged by wins and losses.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a bust for Pasadena when its team played in the 2002
Rose Bowl, thumping the University of Nebraska, 37 to 14, to win the
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   "If you looked at overhead shots of the game, all you saw was
Nebraska red in the stands," said one Rose Bowl official. "The Miami
fans didn't turn out."</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, the Rose Bowl can generate $60 million to $80
million in direct spending for Southern California over a three-day
period, depending on which teams are playing and how well the economy
is doing.</TE>
<TE>   Attracting teams that, in the parlance of the bowl business,
"travel well," was the primary reason behind San Francisco's push
this year to create its first college bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Dwelling in the tourism doldrums for the last year, Bay Area hotel
owners and the city's Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau turned to the San
Francisco Giants for a quick boost.</TE>
<TE>   They persuaded the baseball team to turn its scenic waterfront
ballpark into a holiday gridiron, and after acquiring corporate
sponsorship, the Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl was born.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural game will be played on New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole goal with this game is to bring people to San Francisco
during what is historically the slowest week of the year for our
hotels," said John Marks, who heads the visitors bureau and the San
Francisco Bowl Game Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Marks estimates that 10,000 out-of-town fans will generate as much
as $10 million in direct spending on hotels, meals, local
transportation, shopping and game tickets over a three- or four-day
period.</TE>
<TE>   But Pac-10 Conference teams need not apply. To ensure that only
out-of-towners attend, and that the matchup will be geographically
diverse enough for a national ESPN broadcast, organizers have focused
on getting teams from outside the region.</TE>
<TE>   They crafted an agreement to take the No. 3 team from the Mountain
West Conference -- which includes Colorado State, Air Force Academy
and Brigham Young University -- and pit it against the third-,
fourth- or fifth-ranked team from the Big East, which counts football
powers Pittsburgh, Miami and Virginia Tech among its members.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a special provisional nod to Notre Dame, which is a
member of neither the Mountain West nor Big East but could be invited
by San Francisco depending on national rankings and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame has "a phenomenal following," said Marks, who added
that the bowl's $750,000 payout to each team would be attractive to
the Fighting Irish only in a year when they had four or five losses.</TE>
<TE>   The team typically rakes in millions for starring in other bowls,
and a single Rose Bowl appearance usually means about $14 million.</TE>
<TE>   One Pasadena hotel manager was elated over the chances of an Irish
New Year, remote as they are.</TE>
<TE>   "Notre Dame would be just great!" said Ray Serafin, general
manager of the Sheraton Pasadena Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The top six hotels in the Pasadena area could bring in about $2
million in revenue over New Year's weekend if two teams with loyal,
high-spending out-of-town fans get the bowl bid.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in the season, the most likely Rose Bowl matchup is
Iowa and Washington State, which should make for an excellent three
or four days for Pasadena hotels, restaurants and shops, tourism
officials say. Iowa last played in the Rose Bowl in 1991. Big gaps
between appearances usually bring out the fans, said John Luke,
general manager of the Hilton Pasadena. (Notre Dame hasn't been to
the Rose Bowl in 78 years.)</TE>
<TE>   Washington State, which last played in the Rose Bowl in 1998, has
the advantage of being one of the four Pac-10 school in the Pacific
Northwest, a relief to the local hospitality community, which doesn't
like to see UCLA and USC in the big game.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday's college football scores gave pause to the Pasadena
tourism industry. USC's 52-21 thrashing of UCLA combined with the
University of Washington's triple overtime victory over rival
Washington State increased the chances of the dreaded local-team
scenario. A UCLA upset over Washington State on Dec. 7 would hand USC
the Pac-10 championship and an automatic Rose Bowl bid.</TE>
<TE>   "When it is a local team, people come out for the game," said
Leann Lampe of the Pasadena Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, "but they
don't fill the hotels."</TE>

<HD>More Strings Now Attached to Online Deals</HD>
<DH>Plenty of sites still offer free shipping and other
customer perks, but with conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's beginning to look a lot like a conditional Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   All purchases at the discount Men's Wearhouse Inc. Web site --
including a $279.99 black Evan-Picone suit helpfully described as
"appropriate for a funeral" -- come with free shipping. But unlike
the early years of electronic commerce, when sites fought to outdo
each other by lavishing perks on customers, "free" comes with strings
attached this holiday season.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, Men's Wearhouse will ship the purchase at no cost -- to one
of its 475 stores, where the customer must pick it up.</LD>
<TE>   "They might call that shipping," said David Schehr, who follows
online retailing for market research firm GartnerG2. "I call it
distribution."</TE>
<TE>   Customers can have their suits shipped directly to their homes,
although that costs extra.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere you go on the Net, promotions such as free shipping for
life and coupons that never expire have melted away. Now there's a
catch lurking in the fine print.</TE>
<TE>   "You think you are going to get free shipping," said Lauren
Freedman, president of research firm E-tailing Group Inc. "But then
you find out that you have to buy a minimum amount and only from
certain categories. You get a coupon, but it's only good for like
five minutes."</TE>
<TE>   The extras "are still there," she added, "but they come with
conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The trend began in earnest last year.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 2000, 28% of major e-commerce sites offered free shipping
on all purchases, according to a survey by E-tailing. Last year, it
was down to 4%.</TE>
<TE>   The golden age of freebies was the late 1990s. Since then, the
extraordinary deals have died out with the companies that offered
them.</TE>
<TE>   More.com, a site that sold health and beauty products, offered its
customers "free shipping for life" and locked in the prices of some
items forever. As it happened, most customers outlived More.com,
which folded in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere online, similar great deals included a $15 coupon from
Pets.com with no minimum purchase, which amounted to $15 worth of
free merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the three CDs or videos for $1 from 800.com and
free overnight shipping from computer retailer Outpost.com.</TE>
<TE>   "These were way too aggressive promotions," said Kate Delhagen,
retail research director for Forrester Research. "There was no way a
good business model could sustain it. You want promotions to attract
a customer, but you have to make sure that relationship has a
potential to be profitable. We've returned to good old marketing 101,
if you ask me."</TE>
<TE>   This holiday season, online retailing leader Amazon.com Inc. is
offering free shipping for purchases of more than $25, though if a
customer has purchased multiple items, they must all be grouped
together in one shipment. Also this holiday season, Amazon has been
offering a $30 coupon to shoppers who place a $50 order, but there's
a catch: The $50 must be spent in Amazon's new apparel store.</TE>
<TE>   The conditions are everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   L.L. Bean Inc.'s site offers free monogramming in addition to free
shipping. But to qualify, customers must purchase their goods with an
L.L. Bean credit card.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site for the Chico's chain of women's clothing stores
offers free shipping to members of its Passport Club. What does it
take to join? Simply spend $500 in the stores or at the site.</TE>
<TE>   At Men's Wearhouse, about 20% of the orders placed on the
company's site are sent to the stores under the free shipping policy,
said Ralph Briskin, the Houston-based clothier's director of
e-commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "The customer gets a call from the store when it arrives," he
said. "So it's a nice personal touch."</TE>
<TE>   If the customer chooses to have his funereal suit delivered to his
home, the shipping costs a minimum of $3. But Briskin said the
in-store pickup option has its advantages. For instance, if the suit
doesn't fit, the customer can exchange it right away. Of course, he
also might spot a coordinating tie or pair of socks and make an
impulse purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "We love it that he might consider that," Briskin said. "It could
only work in our favor."</TE>

<HD>Some Beekeepers Are Gathering Sweeter Profits</HD>
<DH>Restrictions on imports and a drought are lifting prices
being offered for honey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kim Baca</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>Some of the nation's beekeepers are buzzing about profits after
having been offered higher prices for honey this year, ending a
multiyear slump.</LD>
<LD>   Beekeepers are being paid about $1 to $1.20 a pound, about twice
as much as in recent years. The increase is due to restrictions on
cheaper imports and a shortage of honey amid a nationwide drought.</LD>
<LD>   "The price on the store shelf is still very affordable, it's still
within a buck or two, but we are getting our share finally," said
Richard Adee of the American Honey Producers Assn.</LD>
<TE>   California is one of the top honey states in the nation, producing
30,800 pounds in 2000. Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota also
rank high.</TE>
<TE>   Tariffs were placed on Argentine and Chinese exports last year,
helping U.S. producers in their battle against cheap foreign honey.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the United States put an immediate stop on all honey
shipments from China, one of the leading exporters, after the
antibiotic chloramphenicol was found in the honey.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibits chloramphenicol in
food because of concerns about the potential for serious blood
disorders in humans. Chloramphenicol is used to control disease in
shrimp, crawfish and bees.</TE>
<TE>   However, not all beekeepers are reaping profits. Some have been
stung by the nationwide drought, causing less wild foliage for bees
to pollinate. Bees gather pollen as they go from plant to plant
seeking nectar, which is carried back to the hive to turn into honey.</TE>
<TE>   The Honey Producers Assn. estimates a 27% decrease in production
this year, with a total of about 160 million pounds, down from 186
million pounds in 2001. Honey production two years ago was 220
million pounds.</TE>
<TE>   To make ends meet, some beekeepers move to California in the
winter to prepare bees for the second part of their business,
pollination. Beekeepers start feeding bees in December in
anticipation of the pollination process that starts in February.</TE>
<TE>   Lyle Johnston, a Colorado resident, has been coming to the San
Joaquin Valley for 20 years with his bee colonies to rent hives for
$52 each to farmers for pollination. But he warned that there may be
a shortage of colonies to rent this year.</TE>

<HD>7 Latin Stocks Could Be Delisted in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Declining share prices mean the firms don't meet
requirements for the NYSE or Nasdaq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew J. Barden</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Grupo Iusacell and at least six other Latin American companies may be
about to lose their listings on U.S. stock markets because of
declining share prices.</LD>
<LD>   Investor interest in Latin American shares has waned amid currency
devaluations, political unrest and a regional economic slump.</LD>
<LD>   Losing a listing in the U.S., where the shares trade as American
depositary receipts, would shrink a company's pool of shareholders
because many U.S. investors probably wouldn't make the added effort,
and take the added risk, to buy the stocks in their home markets.</LD>
<TE>   "Having the ADR listing means it is more attractive," said Graham
Makohoniuk, who manages $650 million in Latin American stocks at
Globalvest Management Co. in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. "It tells us
more people are looking at the company, and for our exit strategies,
it gives us many more options."</TE>
<TE>   Companies from Mexico to Chile began listing on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market in the 1990s, when the region's
economy was growing and investment there was soaring.</TE>
<TE>   Of 108 Latin American companies with shares trading on U.S.
markets, seven currently don't meet listing requirements, according
to Bloomberg data. Those include Grupo Iusacell, Mexico's
third-largest mobile phone company; Net Servicos de Comunicacao,
Brazil's biggest cable-television operator; and Corimon, a Venezuelan
paint maker.</TE>
<TE>   The others are Madeco, a Chilean copper company; Brazilian
long-distance firm Embratel Participacoes; Supermercados Unimarc, a
Chilean supermarket company; and Empresas ICA Sociedad Controladora,
a Mexican construction firm.</TE>
<TE>   The number is eight if Florida-based America Online Latin America
Inc. is included.</TE>
<TE>   Of the eight, all trade on the NYSE except Net Servicos and AOL
Latin America, which trade on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Companies can lose their listing on the NYSE for a number of
reasons, including if their average global market capitalization
drops below $15 million or if the average closing price of the shares
is less than $1 for 30 consecutive trading days.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq has similar listing rules.</TE>
<TE>   Madeco is considering swapping current shares, which trade for 33
cents each, for new shares via a so-called reverse split, which
reduces the total shares outstanding and boosts the price.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to maintain our commitment with U.S. investors," said
Jorge Tagle, chief financial officer of Madeco. "One option is a
reverse split, and we are studying all the alternatives in order to
maintain our listing."</TE>
<TE>   Trading in Latin American shares has declined this year even as
overall trading on the NYSE has climbed.</TE>
<TE>   The value of trading in Latin American equities for the first 10
months of the year was $58.9 billion, compared with $82.9 billion
last year and $141.4 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. listing is the only window left for many Latin American
firms to raise funds, some investors said. Private financing has
dried up as global investors seek higher potential gains in Asia and
other regions.</TE>
<TE>   Investment in Latin America soared in the 1990s as international
companies sought to tap into the region's growth. Since then,
concerns about government debt defaults, currency devaluations and
corporate bankruptcies have boosted borrowing costs and cut
investment.</TE>
<TE>   For companies such as Corimon, keeping a U.S. listing is critical
as the company's home market slumps. The value of daily trading on
the Caracas Stock Exchange has dropped to $800,000 from $7 million
five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. listing "will keep the window open for further
opportunities in accessing the capital markets," said Carlos
Moctezuma, head of investor relations at Iusacell.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Stocks rose overseas Thursday, with Japan's main index hitting a
two-month high, as investors grew hopeful that economic growth will
speed up in the months ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said many markets got a lift from Wall Street's big rally
Wednesday, when the Dow Jones industrial average surged 255.26 points
to 8,931.68, posting its best-ever day before Thanksgiving.</LD>
<LD>   European investors also were encouraged by data showing a jump in
French manufacturing confidence.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. markets were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. They will
reopen today, but for a shortened session that will end at 10 a.m.
PST.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei stock index rocketed
300.90 points, or 3.4%, to 9,176.78. It was the Nikkei's highest
close since Sept. 30, when it was at 9,383.29.</TE>
<TE>   Technology and other export-dependent blue-chip issues led the
market's advance. Advantest and Kyocera were among the day's biggest
gainers, and Sony, NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Toshiba, and automakers
Toyota and Honda also finished higher.</TE>
<TE>   Traders said in addition to Wall Street's gain Wednesday -- which
followed a raft of encouraging economic data -- Japanese investors
took heart from reports that an economic plan expected from Japan's
government today will inject public funds into the nation's
struggling banks.</TE>
<TE>   The banks are saddled with massive bad loans at a time when many
corporate borrowers are struggling.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 203.25
points, or 2%, to 10,147.84.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean stocks climbed on heavy buying by foreign investors.
The composite index rose 6.47 points, or 0.9%, to 714.54.</TE>
<TE>   Australian shares posted strong gains, led by mining companies,
amid hopes that a stronger U.S. economy will boost demand for
Australian commodities. The All Ordinaries index surged 39 points, or
1.3%, to 3,007.20.</TE>
<TE>   But Taiwanese shares closed slightly lower amid uncertainties over
the stance taken by the newly appointed finance minister toward tax
policy. The benchmark index dipped 20.43 points, or 0.4%, to
4,612.60.</TE>
<TE>   In European trading, the CAC 40 index, the benchmark for French
stocks, added 16.23 points, or 0.5%, to 3,329.99, after a survey of
2,000 companies showed that manufacturers' confidence grew in
November for the first time six months, according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, the FTSE-100 index jumped 41.20 points, or 1%, to
4,185.40.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's DAX index gained 14.62 points, or 0.4%, to 3,360.76, its
advance muted somewhat after Munich Re, the world's largest
reinsurer, reported a large third-quarter loss.</TE>
<TE>   In Canada, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index rallied 30.01
points, or 0.5%, to 6,634.26.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, stocks were mostly flat in thin trading after the IPC
index surged 3.5% on Wednesday, tracking Wall Street's gains.</TE>
<TE>   Most major markets worldwide would have to rally dramatically
between now and Dec. 31 to erase their year-to-date losses.</TE>

<HD>Investors Seek Share of Brokers' Penalties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities regulators and Wall Street firms still are haggling over
how much brokerages should pay for the sins of the 1990s bull market,
but questions are being raised about whether small investors who lost
billions when the bubble burst will see any of that money.</LD>
<LD>   It's a debate that centers on people such as George Wolfberg.</LD>
<LD>   The 64-year-old Pacific Palisades resident figures he lost
thousands of dollars in recent years by following the advice of Jack
Grubman, Henry Blodget and other now-disgraced stock analysts. If the
major brokerages are forced to pay fines to settle charges that their
analysts' recommendations were tainted by conflicts of interest, the
money should go to those who suffered, Wolfberg said.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be great to get some of my money back," said Wolf- berg,
a retired Los Angeles city budget supervisor. "If there's a
restitution fund, the money should go to people who were harmed by
the bad behavior of the Wall Street analysts."</TE>
<TE>   State and federal officials are negotiating with a dozen Wall
Street investment banks to settle probes of stock analyst conduct
during the 1990s bull market. The firms, including Citigroup Inc.'s
Salomon Smith Barney unit, Bear Stearns Cos. and Credit Suisse First
Boston, are expected to agree to pay $1 billion or more in fines to
avoid battles with regulators. They would shell out an additional $1
billion to fund an effort to distribute independent research.</TE>
<TE>   What to do with the money -- return it to aggrieved investors or
pad the coffers of cash-strapped governments -- is becoming a highly
charged issue.</TE>
<TE>   Paying restitution to investors is critical, some experts contend,
because it could be the only way for many people to recoup any of
their stock market losses.</TE>
<TE>   The payback would cover only a sliver of each investor's losses,
according to James Newman, executive director of Securities Class
Action Services, which follows class-action lawsuits. Still, Newman
added, "if you get a check in the mail for a few hundred dollars ...
it's better that investors get something."</TE>
<TE>   But regulators in many states, which collectively would receive
about half the money paid by the firms, plan to keep it rather than
hand it to investors.</TE>
<TE>   A possible exception could be New York, where Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer has indicated that he would be amenable to reimbursing
investors. After Spitzer reached a deal with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. this
year that required the firm to pay a $100-million penalty, he was
criticized for not giving those funds to investors.</TE>
<TE>   The temptation to keep the money is sure to be strong among state
governments grappling with budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   In California, which is facing a river of red ink, settlement
money would go to the general fund or to the Department of
Corporations to be used for investor education and for beefing up the
enforcement unit of its securities division. Gov. Davis would make
the final decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to help investors protect themselves, as opposed to
getting pennies back on their dollars," said Andre Pineda, deputy
commissioner of the California Department of Corporations. "Investors
would be better served by getting the tools to prevent them from
losing money in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Budget issues aside, setting up a restitution fund would be a
logistical nightmare, some state officials say. Theoretically,
everyone who owned stocks, even those who invested indirectly through
401(k) accounts, could claim to be eligible.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, it would be difficult to determine how much investors
relied on analyst advice when buying stocks. Did people invest based
solely on a research report, or did they simply watch a 30-second
interview on a financial news show?</TE>
<TE>   Even if the number of claimants were whittled down, that would
still leave millions of investors who would receive minimal amounts,
state officials say.</TE>
<TE>   At least one lawmaker says shareholders deserve the money. Rep.
Richard H. Baker (R-La.) said he plans to introduce a bill next year
to force states to pay funds collected in actions against brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   If fines are withheld "simply to fatten up government coffers, and
no effort is made to reimburse" those who've been wronged "I think it
would be really difficult to interpret this whole process as anything
close to a victory for individual investors," said Baker, who chairs
the House subcommittee on capital markets.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfberg agrees. Encouraged in part by the bullish spoutings of
analysts, Wolfberg said he invested in telecom and technology stocks
in the late 1990s. Walt Disney Co. and Home Depot Inc. were among
other stocks he said he either bought or held on to -- based in part
on analyst recommendations. Once highfliers, these stocks lost more
than half of their value during the current bear market.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials, Wolfberg remarked, are certainly not shy
about raising taxes when they need to plug budget deficits. "They're
always happy to come to us when they screw up," he said. "So why,
when we screw up and get some recompense, should we share it with
them?"</TE>
<TE>   State governments are only part of the equation. Federal
regulators would get about half of any Wall Street settlement, and
it's unclear what the fate of that money would be.</TE>
<TE>   A major securities reform law passed this summer allows the
Securities and Exchange Commission to create restitution funds for
investors. But the agency isn't required to do so, explained John
Coffee, a Columbia University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, Coffee said, the settlement would have to establish
a "disgorgement" fund in which firms gave back illicit profits. Civil
fines then could be added to the disgorgement pot, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The restitution fund has taken on added significance because of
uncertainty about how investors would fare in the class-action
lawsuits that have been filed against brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   State regulators say the best way to help shareholders would be to
release detailed findings of brokerage wrongdoing as part of a
settlement. Investors could then use that information, which would
include incriminating e-mails and other documents, in the
class-action suits, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Investors historically have received only a fraction of their
losses in class actions, however. Since 1990, the average securities
class action has been settled for 12 cents on every dollar in claimed
losses, according to National Economic Research Associates Inc., a
White Plains, N.Y., consulting firm. That excludes attorneys' fees,
which can lop 30% or more off a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   To Wolfberg, that's all the more reason to parcel out settlement
funds to investors.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes the pain a little less," he said.</TE>

<HD>Record Labels Grapple With CD Protection</HD>
<DH>The industry again vows this will be the last holiday
season without anti-piracy measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey and Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For three straight holiday seasons, record executives say, Internet
piracy has been the Grinch of the music business, undercutting album
sales and labels' year-end profits.</LD>
<LD>   So how did the labels open the biggest music-buying period of the
year? By shipping an estimated 250 million albums to retailers
without any protection against digital piracy.</LD>
<LD>   Music and technology executives vow that this will be the last
holiday season without widespread use of technology that prevents
songs from being transferred from CDs to the Internet. Of course,
they've made that prediction before.</LD>
<TE>   Top executives at Vivendi Universal, owner of the largest record
company, said last year that every CD they released this Christmas
would have anti-copying technology. Each of its rivals, meanwhile,
was testing ways to produce CDs that resisted piracy.</TE>
<TE>   So far, though, the only commercial U.S. releases with copy
protection have been four comparatively obscure discs from Universal.
Think rapper Pretty Willie, not rap star Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most striking about the labels' failure to lock down CDs
is that they have taken a particularly aggressive stance abroad,
where copy-protected discs are increasingly common.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of new titles have been released overseas with copy
protection, including the latest efforts by hit makers such as Celine
Dion, Robbie Williams and the Foo Fighters. Many, including those
from Sony Corp. and Bertelsmann subsidiary BMG, can't even be played
on a computer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people will be surprised in January when they hear the
number of releases that came out with copy protection" overseas, said
Adam Sexton, vice president of marketing for Macrovision Corp., a
Santa Clara, Calif.-based supplier of anti-piracy technology.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, executives are clamoring to shut off the stream of
music flowing online in the United States, where album sales have
declined an unprecedented 10% this year. Although other factors have
helped drive down demand -- including complaints about the price and
quality of CDs as well as the rising competition from DVDs and video
games -- the global reach of online piracy is undeniable.</TE>
<TE>   So why haven't more copy-protected discs been released in the
world's biggest CD market?</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that three years after Napster Inc. demonstrated how
easily an ordinary CD can be shared by consumers around the globe,
label executives don't think the technology for copy-protected CDs is
foolproof enough to release domestically. They also worry that
American consumers are so enamored of "ripping" music onto their
computers that they would reject CDs with copy protection and rebel
against artists who record such albums.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, the cry for protection at any costs turned into
an 'Oh, my God, we might lose the people that are left' kind of
fear," said Chief Executive Peter Jacobs of SunnComm Inc., a
Phoenix-based developer of copy-protected CDs.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. consumers have more legal freedom to make copies for personal
use than listeners in Europe or Japan, and they're more likely to sue
when their expectations aren't met. Two California consumers already
have filed a class-action lawsuit against the five major record
companies, alleging that copy-protected CDs are defective products
that shouldn't be allowed on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The labels also face opposition from some artists who argue that
copy-protected CDs will drive away fans. Said Jim Guerinot, who
manages such acts as No Doubt and Beck, "We build this nice wall
around our music so people can't steal it, but how many people are we
blocking from actually using it?"</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, even label executives agree that copy-protection
technologies can't stop every would-be pirate from breaking the locks
on the songs. And all it takes to fuel global copying on a
file-sharing network is one person with an unlocked version of the
CD.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, executives at SunnComm and Macrovision say they're
close to completing work on new versions of anti-piracy technology
that will satisfy the labels' demands for U.S. releases. The latest
approach will allow songs to be copied to computers, transferred to
portable devices and even recorded onto CDs -- with some limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, SunnComm said it's already installing its anti-copying
gear in a CD manufacturing plant in North Carolina owned by
Bertelsmann subsidiary Sonopress. By next year's holiday season,
executives at the two companies say, a sizable percentage of the
major labels' releases will be copy-protected.</TE>
<TE>   CDs were introduced in 1982, when consumers weren't equipped to
make digital copies and piracy was largely the work of professionals.
The discs' vulnerability didn't become evident until the late 1990s,
when millions of consumers with powerful personal computers could
convert CDs into compressed data files that were easily copied, and
affordable high-speed Internet connections could distribute those
files in a matter of seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Now, much of the music recorded during the last four decades is
available free online -- a notion that terrifies record labels whose
bottom lines rely on continuous sales and reissues of artists' older
work.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the price of the equipment used to duplicate CDs has
plummeted, fueling a rise in copying. Label executives say this kind
of copying takes place on a smaller scale than that enabled by online
file-sharing networks, with consumers making copies for a few friends
instead of the entire Internet. Yet it's become so widespread in
parts of Europe, some executives argue, that it's a bigger problem
there than online piracy.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Sony, SunnComm and Midbar Tech Ltd., among others,
produced discs that couldn't be read by computers, CD duplicators and
other devices with CD-ROM drives but that still worked in standard CD
players. But the initial discs confounded many DVD players, high-end
car stereos and other portable devices with CD-ROM drives, generating
a storm of criticism that sent the engineers back to the drawing
board.</TE>
<TE>   Later versions of the technology improved the discs' compatibility
with DVD players, although they sacrificed some degree of protection
against copying. The industry also created "dual session" discs that
presented the songs in two copy-protected formats: one that could be
played by basic CD players and another that could be played by a
computer.</TE>
<TE>   These changes were more than enough to satisfy the record
companies' demands for foreign markets. They also convinced Universal
to proceed with four copy-protected U.S. releases. While Pretty
Willie ("Enter the Life of Suella") and Los Toros Band ("Serenatas")
have sold less than 40,000 discs combined, two copy-protected
soundtracks have done surprisingly well, according to sales figures
compiled by Nielsen SoundScan: "Brown Sugar" has sold about 280,000
copies, and "More Music From the Fast and the Furious" about 263,000.</TE>
<TE>   A Universal spokeswoman said a tiny percentage of the four discs
has been returned, matching the rate for conventional CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with Napster demonstrating how eager U.S. consumers are to
copy songs onto computers and create custom playlists, Universal and
its rivals want one more change for the U.S. market. They have asked
tech companies to supply dual-session discs with songs that can't be
transmitted over the Net but can be ripped onto a computer and
transferred to portable devices.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs at SunnComm said his company's latest technology fits the
bill, and it's being tested by three of the five major record
companies. Sexton of Macrovision, which bought Midbar in early
November, said his company will have a similar offering early next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, Sexton said, is to enable all the personal uses
consumers expect from an ordinary CD, just in a more limited fashion.
In particular, the dual-session discs being developed by SunnComm and
Macrovision don't allow consumers to convert songs to MP3 files, the
most popular format for music on computers and portable digital
players.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, when consumers copy one of the new discs onto their
computers, they end up with a set of scrambled song files in
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Media Audio format. Those files can be
transferred only to portable devices that support Windows Media.</TE>
<TE>   The labels also want copy-protected discs to support CD burning,
but only if it can be limited to a few homemade CDs that can't be
duplicated, officials say. William H. Whitmore, SunnComm's chief
operating officer, said his company is working with Microsoft to
enable this kind of restricted burning, but "we're probably about 30%
to 40% through the design issues on that."</TE>
<TE>   The new SunnComm discs also would let consumers share music with
friends via the Internet, albeit in a tightly controlled manner. Disc
buyers would be able to send an e-mail with a link to a song, which
the recipient could download and play for a limited time, Whitmore
said.</TE>
<TE>   David Munns, vice chairman of EMI's recorded music division, vowed
that the 2002 holiday season would be his company's last without the
widespread use of copy-protection technology on its new releases.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Munns cautioned that record companies face a massive task
in seeking to lock songs onto CDs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to educate our people and our artists, and we've got
big factory issues," Munns said. "It's a big workload, and we've got
to get through it."</TE>
<TE>   Although artists have diverged on the merits of copy-protected
CDs, some say the labels must start releasing them to stem the flow
of unprotected music onto the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Manager David Sonenberg said he had endorsed a plan by Sony Music
to release his client Wyclef Jean's latest album in Europe with
encryption technology. But he said, "I'm not sure it isn't having an
adverse effect on some sales."</TE>
<TE>   If Sony decided to release the album with encryption in the U.S.,
he said, "I would certainly be for it, but I would hope that
everybody else was doing it too.... If it works, there's no question
in my mind that every one of these record companies will be doing it
in America in short order."</TE>

<HD>Tenet Shifting Its Formula for Reimbursement</HD>
<DH>It is close to signing a deal that reduces its reliance on
payments based on a hospital's retail charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp., trying to clean up its image after admitting
that it aggressively raised hospital charges that inflated Medicare
payments, is overhauling the way it is reimbursed for hospital
services from managed-care companies.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of negotiations, Tenet is close to signing a two-year
contract with Health Net Inc. that sharply reduces Tenet's reliance
on payments based on a hospital's retail charges.</LD>
<LD>   The shift signals that Santa Barbara-based Tenet, the nation's
second-biggest hospital chain, is backing away from its
much-criticized policy of ramping up hospital prices.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement, expected to be announced early next week, may be a
harbinger of broader changes and more turmoil in the health-care
industry as insurers and providers battle for an advantage amid
soaring medical-care and drug costs, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, Blue Cross of California said, Tenet has asked
it to reopen contracts covering dozens of Tenet hospitals, and some
health insurance companies have given notice to other hospitals that
they may want to restructure reimbursement methods in the wake of
what has happened at Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Two managed-care firms "say they are auditing Tenet and will come
back and renegotiate with us," said Ann Pumpian, chief financial
officer at Sharp Healthcare, a nonprofit operator of seven hospitals
in the San Diego area.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp is not in a position to accept lower reimbursements, Pumpian
said. But if Tenet, the state's biggest hospital chain, retreats from
rapidly raising its retail or list prices, "my expectation is that
other hospitals will be keeping hospital charges lower than they
have," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Few patients ever pay full retail charges, and Medicare and
insurance companies generally pay hospitals fixed rates for certain
procedures and services. But Tenet came under fire in the last month
for sharply raising its retail prices because that enabled the
company to collect a large share of Medicare reimbursements for
expensive procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet has said that it did not break any Medicare rules. But the
administrator of the Medicare program has accused Tenet of
inappropriately gaming the system, and federal regulators are
auditing the company's Medicare reimbursements known as "outlier"
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Outlier fees are paid to hospitals for unusually costly cases and
are based on a hospital's costs and retail charges. So the more a
hospital raises its list prices -- from X-ray charges to patient room
rates -- the more it gets in outlier payments.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet revealed this month that outlier payments were the source of
about half of its stellar earnings growth in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, rapid increases in retail prices have allowed Tenet and
some other hospital companies to collect more reimbursements from
managed-care firms.</TE>
<TE>   Most health insurers pay hospitals a flat, negotiated daily rate
for patient care -- usually a fraction of the retail charges. But as
with the Medicare system, hospitals also receive "stop-loss" payments
from insurers for special cases that can be very expensive. And like
outliers, these stop-loss payments are calculated as a percentage of
retail charges.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet declined to say how much revenue the company collected from
stop-loss payments. But Adam Feinstein, a hospital analyst at Lehman
Bros. in New York, estimates that stop-loss fees generally account
for 10% of a hospital's commercial reimbursements. In Tenet's case,
that would translate into about $800 million of its $13.9 billion in
revenue in its last fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's chief executive, Jeffrey C. Barbakow, has initiated a
review of the company's pricing practices at its 113 hospitals
nationwide. This month he pushed out his top two managers, and he has
all but said that Tenet will back away from its aggressive pricing
strategy. But that shift has raised concerns among analysts about
Tenet's future earnings growth.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview this week, Barbakow brushed aside those concerns.
He and other Tenet officials declined to elaborate, saying they
expect to comment on managed-care contracts as well as the company's
new pricing strategy at a conference in New York on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   With 40 hospitals in the state, mostly in Southern California,
Tenet still has considerable clout when negotiating rates with health
insurers. Tenet is bargaining with PacifiCare Health Systems and will
be starting talks with Blue Shield of California soon. If Tenet can
negotiate much higher fixed daily rates from insurers -- enough to
offset diminished stop-loss payments -- the hospital company could
sustain the strong growth in reimbursements from managed-care firms.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts are skeptical. "It's going to be tough for the
company to exert the kind of leverage they've had," said Sheryl
Skolnick, a managing director at Fulcrum Global Partners, which
provides investor research.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Tenet's problems, Skolnick cut in half her forecast
for the company's earnings for its next fiscal year. Tenet will lose
about $750 million in Medicare outlier payments and face a lower rate
of growth in reimbursements from health insurers, she estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Skolnick's revised forecast also includes legal fees and expenses
for Tenet's other troubles, including a medical fraud investigation
at a Tenet hospital in Redding involving two doctors who allegedly
performed unnecessary heart operations.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's turmoil in the last month has erased about 70% of the
value of the company's stock. Its shares have nudged higher in recent
days -- they rose 65 cents Wednesday to $18.15 on the New York Stock
Exchange -- but remain well below the 52-week high of $52.50 in early
October.</TE>
<TE>   Other stocks in the sector have slid as well, in part because
investors are worried that hospitals will be reluctant to boost
retail charges in light of the scrutiny that Tenet has drawn.</TE>
<TE>   "That has a certain chilling effect," said Noah Rosenberg, a
Beverly Hills attorney who represents many hospitals and medical
groups in negotiations with managed-care companies.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, health insurers in California -- which have been
aligning with employer groups to pressure hospitals to lower their
charges -- are likely to use the opportunity to try to extract
concessions from hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Max Brown, a senior vice president at Blue Cross of California,
would not comment about the upcoming contract talks with Tenet. He
said, however, that Blue Cross has been concerned that hospitals have
been raising retail charges sharply to maximize their stop-loss
payments from insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Some hospital operators deny that this is the case, saying their
charges reflect the rising costs of hiring nurses, adding new
technologies and reinvesting in hospitals. Moreover, said Rosenberg,
"the kinds of increases hospitals get pale in comparison to what
insurers are getting from employers in premiums."</TE>

<HD>Tower Records Hopes to Shake the Retail Blues This Holiday</HD>
<DH>The chain tries to tackle discount rivals, changing buying
habits and its debt problems. Shoppers will see more non-music
products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Wasserman</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tower Records, the storied 1960s music chain that launched the music
megastore and became a cultural retailing icon, strolls into its 43rd
holiday shopping season this weekend struggling with debt and on the
ropes.</LD>
<LD>   The West Sacramento, Calif.-based Tower hopes four weeks of strong
sales will reverse a new image as the tottering giant inside a
stumbling music industry. Among the chain's troubles:
deep-discounting rivals, changing consumer habits, lack of hits and
its own missteps in the 1990s as the music business began a
significant shift.</LD>
<LD>   Tower exemplifies the even deeper woes in a recording industry
beset by piracy, computer CD burners and fans who download from the
Internet rather than buy from stores.</LD>
<TE>   As 2002's countdown to Christmas begins, the family-held chain of
113 stores in 21 states -- known for steep prices, deep selection and
superstore band appearances -- is in the hands of a corporate
restructurer.</TE>
<TE>   The company that grew up on rock 'n' roll and matured into a hip
center of world music recently cut 90 jobs and sold 51 profitable
stores in Japan. More closings are imminent. Tower also has
overhauled management, begun experimenting with non-music merchandise
-- and has reported its first sales gain over last year: up 2% for
the first two weeks of November.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its restructuring, the company has even begun reviewing
its CD prices, which often prompt mainstream record buyers to scoff
and buy elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Where Tower prices, where they've historically priced, to be
perfectly honest, is not competitive," said Colin McGranahan, an
investment analyst at Sanford Bernstein in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Tower's typical CD can cost as much as $18.99, compared with
$13.99 or $14.99 at Best Buy Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Amazon.com
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But the chain has a loyal base of older, more-affluent customers
who spend heavily on music and appreciate its wide selection. "It
seems to me," said Lee Landenberger, 46, of Atlanta, a former radio
DJ who spends $2,000 a year on music and liberally burns CDs for
friends, "their rationale all along has been, 'We charge a lot and
always have, but we have such a huge catalog of stuff that's going to
bring you in.' "</TE>
<TE>   After $167 million in losses over four years, Tower aims to keep
its brand alive, regroup and rebuild. And in the season when record
retailers typically rack up 30% of their annual sales, Tower's
managers see a chance for new life.</TE>
<TE>   Under the eyes of watchful creditors, they're fast remaking Tower
into a "full entertainment" store.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for things that can move the needle quickly," said
Betsy Burton, 50, a corporate turnaround specialist hired Sept. 18.
Alongside Tower's mix of Eminem and Pavarotti, Burton is blending
"fun things for the holidays, unique toys and collectibles, pop
culture and offbeat things."</TE>
<TE>   She's pushing gift cards while moving in DVDs, small electronics
and more video games, which are seeing double-digit sales growth
again this year.</TE>
<TE>   A similar 1980s Burton strategy -- adding major-brand beauty
products to Supercuts stores -- turned around that ailing chain.</TE>
<TE>   "You can generate some momentum, and everything feeds on itself
with new energy in the store," she said. "It's important to do some
things and do successes early on."</TE>
<TE>   Music purists may sigh, but Burton says it's the path to the
corporation's one true goal at the moment: to reach the end of 2003
earning more money than the interest payments on its $200-million
debt.</TE>
<TE>   Tower's troubles started in 1998, when it borrowed $110 million to
fuel an expansion drive in Asia, South America, Canada and Britain.
In 1997, Tower's founder, Russ Solomon, now 77, boasted in a magazine
interview that his company "can compete with anybody." Solomon also
predicted an industry shakedown in which companies would die and "the
good ones will get bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Not long after, Tower began its four-year streak of losses in a
market turned upside down by free music downloads on Napster and
successors such as Kazaa.</TE>
<TE>   Today, music fans such as Eric Chu, 17, increasingly are turned
off by the prices for CDs. Although record industry officials call
CDs a bargain compared with other entertainment options, Chu browses
at Tower Records for hip-hop, rap and rock music and then downloads
at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to support the music industry," the San Francisco
high school senior said. "But I'm young and I don't have much money."</TE>
<TE>   Investment analysts consider comments like that when they look at
Tower's restructuring strategy and competitive struggle and view
retail stores as long-run losers in the paradigm shift to cyberspace.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, New York-based Nielsen SoundScan, which tracks music
shipments, reports that the recording industry shipped 22.3 million
fewer CDs, cassette tapes and albums in 2001 than in 2000. The
Recording Industry Assn. of America reports that CD shipments fell 7%
in the first half of 2002, after declining 5% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, RIAA estimates that music fans illegally download more
than 2.6 billion music files a month on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrestrial retailers of music have seen their best day,"
said Phil Leigh, digital music analyst with Raymond James Associates
in St. Petersburg, Fla. "What Napster did during its season in the
sun was demonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that the consumer is
ready for music to be distributed over the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein's McGranahan agrees. Tower has done a "decent job"
digging out of its problems, he said, but "regardless of what works,
it's not going to be selling packaged material in stores."</TE>
<TE>   But RIAA Chairwoman Hilary Rosen said, "I'm not that pessimistic.
I think that shopping is a social experience and learning about new
music is a social experience, and you don't get that on Kazaa.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe retailers have to re-energize music stores as social
destinations," she said, and Tower "set the bar for the in-store
experience" where people wander aisles "checking stuff out."</TE>
<TE>   Burton, agreeing that a big shift to digital distribution is
underway, notes that Tower's Internet site now offers paid downloads
from the Universal Music Group catalog. But she says people will
always enjoy the ambience of big music stores and seeing bands
perform.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a place to go, to find fellow enthusiasts and discover new
music," Burton said. "That will always have a place."</TE>
<TE>   This Christmas, 3,400 Tower employees are banking on it.</TE>

<HD>United Mechanics Reject Pay Cut</HD>
<DH>The union's decision could jeopardize other workers'
concessions and potentially lead the airline to file for bankruptcy
protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy Fieweger</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Mechanics at United Airlines said Thursday that they rejected their
portion of $1.5 billion in proposed pay cuts over 5 1/2 years, which
could lead to a filing for bankruptcy protection unless the No. 2
U.S. airline can hammer out a new deal with the union workers
quickly.</LD>
<LD>   The International Assn. of Machinists, District 141M, said its
13,000 members rejected the deal by a 57% margin.</LD>
<LD>   Some 24,000 other IAM members, including public service workers
and baggage handlers, part of a separate bargaining unit called
District 141, approved their portions of the cuts.</LD>
<TE>   United, a unit of UAL Corp., is the largest operator at Los
Angeles International and San Francisco International airports.</TE>
<TE>   Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based United said Thursday that it would
immediately begin new talks with the mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   The mechanics' rejection jeopardizes pay-cut agreements made by
sister unions, including those for pilots and flight attendants,
which said the givebacks were contingent on every union taking part
in the sacrifices.</TE>
<TE>   United posted massive financial losses in 2001 after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and again this year as revenue remained weak. The
airline recently secured $5.2 billion in wage cuts from its
employees, including five separate unions, as part of a financial
recovery plan put before the Air Transportation Stabilization Board.
That is a new federal agency created after the Sept. 11 attacks and
charged with doling out as much as $10 billion in loan guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   United has asked the agency to back $1.8 billion of a $2-billion
loan. It has met with staffers every week recently after the board
said more labor wage concessions were needed than those the carrier
originally outlined.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts say a decision from the ATSB will determine the
near-term fate of United as it tries to avoid restructuring through
the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure on United to present a broad package of labor concessions
has intensified in recent weeks. The airline now faces a debt payment
of $375 million Monday for which it needs new capital.</TE>
<TE>   The ATSB has been a tough sell for many airlines. Some have gotten
their financial plans approved, but others, such as National
Airlines, have been rejected and stopped flying after they ran out of
money.</TE>
<TE>   The powerful IAM represents a variety of United workers. A
committee of leaders agreed to the pay cuts only after months of
intensive negotiations, after winning this year their first pay
raises since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   United faces an imminent bankruptcy filing unless it can persuade
the government to grant the loan guarantees very soon as part of the
landmark aviation bailout package passed last year. The government
wants broad labor cost reductions and a viable business plan.</TE>
<TE>   Mechanics, distrustful of management they say has misguided the
company in the past, apparently disagreed with the need to cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Each employee measured the costs and benefits of participating in
United's recovery plan," Scotty Ford, District 141-M president, said
in a statement. "In the end, some thought the risk was worth taking,
and others felt they had sacrificed enough."</TE>

<DH>They don't come to Gennifer Flowers' New Orleans nightclub
just to hear her sing. And that's OK with her. She's happy to cash
in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>New Orleans</DL>
<LD>New Orleans</LD>
<LD>   It all feels so '90s. So of a bygone era -- when stocks were
climbing and presidential indiscretions were still a matter of
national importance. Or at least prurient interest.</LD>
<LD>   But here in the heart of the French Quarter, where ghosts walk the
iron balconies alongside the living, and characters with tales to
tell are cultivated like hothouse blooms, Gennifer Flowers still
stokes the flame of her fast-fading notoriety.</LD>
<TE>   She was the first of Bill Clinton's bimbo eruptions, and the last
time most of us saw her was in the pages of the Star. Or on "Larry
King." Or detailing the president's preferred sexual positions in
Penthouse. This month she was in the news again when a federal
appeals court ruled that Flowers may pursue a libel and conspiracy
case against Hillary Rodham Clinton and two former presidential
aides, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the country, Clinton's onetime paramour is an
occasional blip in our collective consciousness. But here at 720 St.
Louis St., the legend of Gennifer Flowers lives on.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers has returned to her career as a lounge singer, belting out
standards Thursday through Sunday at the Gennifer Flowers Kelsto
Club. Far from putting the purported pain of the Clinton scandal
behind her, she works it for all it is worth, weaving it into her
nightclub act and seizing any media attention that comes her way.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows why people come -- titillation? a firsthand brush with
scandal? a way to keep their rage against Democrats alive? -- but
night after night, they sit and watch Flowers lean against her gold
grand piano and croon into her mike.</TE>
<TE>   And they eat her up.</TE>
<TE>   You don't go for the music</TE>
<TE>   The club is just off Bourbon Street, right across from Antoine's,
the legendary French Creole restaurant that caters to new wealth and
old New Orleans. It opened a year ago, and, in a city full of crazy
stories, it still makes some locals shake their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't go to see Gennifer Flowers for the music," says a
cabdriver, who confesses he has never been to the club and doesn't
plan to go. "That's like saying you read Playboy for the articles."</TE>
<TE>   "How long is she going to ride this thing?" asks a local merchant,
who says he has never been either.</TE>
<TE>   The sign outside is adorned with a giant lipstick kiss. A head
shot of Flowers hangs in the window.</TE>
<TE>   The club was once a stable for a rich slave owner and most
recently housed Lucky Cheng's, staffed by Asian drag queens. Before
that, in the early '90s, it was a bar called Bogie and Me, run by a
former Hollywood hairdresser who claims to have been Humphrey
Bogart's mistress. The focal point of the room is that great gold
piano, purchased in Las Vegas and said to have once belonged to Bugsy
Siegel. (It's nicknamed "Virginia" after the mobster's starlet
girlfriend, Virginia Hill.)</TE>
<TE>   Flowers takes the floor at about a quarter to 10. She is
accompanied by pianist Mimi Gustd, a feisty woman with a sultry voice
who pounds away on the keys like a mad Muppet and has a face more
expressive than a silent film star's. Tony Seville, bald and bereted,
pulls out assorted instruments like a magician with a hatful of
tricks.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers wears a white tuxedo jacket and a lace camisole. Her
bottle-blond hair is piled atop her head in her trademark up-do. Her
eyes are turquoise. Her lips are red, luscious, always freshly
painted.</TE>
<TE>   When she receives a business card from a patron she smiles, then
tucks it into her cleavage. "I don't have anywhere else, baby," she
drawls.</TE>
<TE>   She sings jazz, blues and R&amp;B. She sings Billie Holiday and some
Patsy Cline. Always, she sings about love gone wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our sentiment to any guy out there who happens to do us
wrong," she says to the ladies in the bar. "Hey, did you happen to
see, the most beautiful guy in the world who walked out on me," she
croons. "Say it, ladies, 'Love gone wrong ... ' "</TE>
<TE>   She's singing "Just One of Those Things" when she breaks into a
playful patter. She includes herself in the great American pantheon
of Women Scorned and celebrates herself as an icon of mistress
culture. She talks about Tammy Faye Bakker and Ivana Trump. Then she
talks about herself: "Gennifer whispered in the president's ear,
'Wanna face the facts, my dear?' "</TE>
<TE>   A collective intake of breath. She said it. The crowd titters,
then goes crazy.</TE>
<TE>   The patrons are a mix of locals, tourists and Quarter characters.
It's a place where everyone seems to be on a first-name basis with
Bill and Hillary.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night this girl was in here," Finis Shelnutt, Gennifer's
husband of five years and her greatest admirer, whispers to Rush
Biossat, a neighborhood regular. "She paid $10 to get her picture
taken with Gennifer. She was a major liberal, a big-time Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   "But this girl met Gennifer," he says proudly. "Now, this girl,
she is one of Gennifer's major fans."</TE>
<TE>   The club seems to be a magnet for disgruntled Republicans, for
whom the Clinton years were the best and worst of times. They come to
reinvigorate their moral outrage and to pay homage to one of the
women who took Slick Willie down.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine with Flowers, who says she votes Republican now
because of her pocketbook but does not identify completely with
either party. She says her campaign was never about Republicans or
Democrats, it was about telling the truth and being called a liar.</TE>
<TE>   On Democrats: "I think the people who want to be angry at me,
after all that has come down the pike, are the dyed-in-the-wool
Democrats who see me as a threat to their party."</TE>
<TE>   On Republicans: "I did have more Republicans come to my aid
because they are not Clinton supporters. I was invited to attend
inauguration balls by some Republicans, and invited to debates by
some Republicans, but they simply wanted to use me as a vehicle to
destroy Clinton. I wouldn't say that they cared about me."</TE>
<TE>   At one table sit some well-heeled Manhattanites. "I came tonight
to wish Gennifer luck in her new case," says Richard Blecka. "I'm not
real nuts about Bill." His wife, Patricia, is delighted by the show,
by Flowers' charisma, presence and, yes, her voice.</TE>
<TE>   The Bleckas purchase two autographed pink plastic shot glasses
shaped like lips (Gennifer's kiss for $10) as political souvenirs:
one for their daughter who works in the Bush administration, and one
for a hardheaded Democratic aunt who used to defend Clinton and his
wandering ways.</TE>
<TE>   Other self-confessed Republicans see that famous name and just
have to stick their heads in. "He saw the name 'Gennifer Flowers' and
he absolutely loved the scandal part of it," says Donna Stephens,
from Atlanta. Her husband protests. "There is no question, when you
saw that name on that sign, that is what brought you in," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in for the scandal," Jim Stephens admits. "She's great!
She can really sing."</TE>
<TE>   "She's average," corrects his wife. "She is just like any typical
nightclub singer in Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   "She's average," says Jim Stephens.</TE>
<TE>   Clinging to her notoriety</TE>
<TE>   Flowers is not just a campy act, a pathetic political footnote.
The truth is much more messy. She has a sly sense of humor and
invites her audience to be in on the joke with a big, flirty wink.
She clings to her 15 minutes of fame with the ferocity of a
professional publicist, welcoming journalists and gawkers alike into
her club.</TE>
<TE>   "I could care less what brings them in," she says of her patrons.
"I appreciate their curiosity."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to cash in -- a picture of her Penthouse cover hangs on
a wall of the bar. But when she talks, her vulnerability, her pain,
her anger at having been made a laughingstock are apparent. It's hard
to decide if she is funny, tragic or absurd.</TE>
<TE>   Her claimed 12-year affair with Bill Clinton may be what defined
her in the public eye, but singing has always been a part of Flowers'
life. She started singing at age 5 in church, back in Brinkley, Ark.,
and got her first recording contract, with United Southern Artists,
at 11.</TE>
<TE>   She used to sing a song called "There Ought to Be a Law." "I sang,
'I wish I had a chance to go to Washington and make a law,' " she
recalls. "Boy, little did I know ..."</TE>
<TE>   She abandoned her recording career to become a regular kid and
cheerleader, and eventually a television news reporter. "That's when
I met Bill," she says. But singing was always the constant in her
life, until the Clinton Thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody would touch me with a 10-foot pole," she says. "One of the
things that really hurt me was that my ability to perform was taken
away from me. I couldn't go to venues where I used to perform because
I would have had the media all over me, the stalkers....</TE>
<TE>   "I was presented by the Clinton propagandists as a vindictive big
blond bitch, a bimbo -- and I do mean bimbo. If they used that word
once they used it 90,000 times. Where were the women's groups then?
It was like riding a wild bull across an arena for days. I was like a
little girl up against a huge power structure that was bent on
destroying me."</TE>
<TE>   She married Finis Shelnutt, a high-powered Little Rock
stockbroker, and moved to Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas. But wherever she
went, the Clinton Thing always came up.</TE>
<TE>   "The Las Vegas Hilton offered me a yearlong contract as a featured
performer. I was just elated," she says. "Then I get a call from the
production manager. He sits me down, he says, 'I don't know how to
tell you this ... ' "</TE>
<TE>   He had just received a call from Arthur Goldberg, an executive
vice president of the Hilton Hotels Corp. "He said, 'Bill Clinton is
a friend of mine. She will never work in any hotel of mine, anywhere,
any time, ever.' "</TE>
<TE>   She moved to New Orleans a year ago, after attending a wedding in
the French Quarter and having a spiritual experience. The wedding was
in the mansion once owned by Virginie Avegno Gautreau, the beauty
known as "Madame X" after the scandalous portrait of her painted by
John Singer Sargent.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Robinson, an antiques dealer who now owns the Madame X
Mansion on Toulouse Street, where a replica of the portrait hangs,
says Flowers was bewitched by it. "She told me, 'I want to tell you
how transported I was by the spirits in your house. Your home is
fabulous, but tell me about this woman.... This woman is calling to
me.' "</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as we got back to Vegas I said, 'Finis, we need to move
to New Orleans,' " Flowers says. Three months later they bought their
first property, on Pirate's Alley.</TE>
<TE>   Shelnutt has bigger plans: He's looking for a huge venue on
Bourbon Street for Gennifer's act. "It will be like the Copacabana,"
he says. "I want to do a crazy show where they will roll me in on a
pair of giant satin lips and have six drag queens all dressed up like
me," she says. They also have plans for a Web site, said to be up any
day now, that will allow visitors to pay a fee of $5 to $10 to see
Flowers perform live online.</TE>
<TE>   "Since when is 'opportunist' a bad word in the United States?" she
asks.</TE>
<TE>   Her feelings about Clinton seem more conflicted. She calls him
"Bill" in conversation, and speaks in a tone so intimate it sounds as
if they're still lovers. Then she lashes out in her sweet but deadly
Southern drawl.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish the [new] case didn't have to be about money," she says.
"I'd like to put him in jail. Unfortunately, it's a civil case."</TE>
<TE>   Given all her pain, maybe people would forget about the whole
thing if she let them, a visitor ventures. That sets her off.</TE>
<TE>   "That Clinton thing has consumed me for the last 12 years. I feel
that is something that I will be dealing with for the rest of my
life." She frets about how her heirs will deal with the aftermath,
although she has no children. "They will be auctioning my things off
at Sotheby's someday, saying, 'This belonged to the president's
mistress.'</TE>
<TE>   "How do you put a dollar figure on integrity? On a reputation that
has been destroyed?"</TE>
<TE>   She seems proud of her past but also wounded by it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how to roll up in the fetal position. People say,
'She just wants to be famous.' Well, what's fame without dignity?"</TE>
<TE>   Another tourist attraction</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens anywhere else, here in the Vieux Carre, history
counts more than today, and a good story is worth even more than the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   "People embellish here," Flowers says. "Stories become almost
fictionalized. So-and-so's mistress lived here. So-and-so's mother
lived here "</TE>
<TE>   Here only a year, Flowers is already a part of local lore, as
vivid and colorful as Marie Laveau the voodoo queen, Jean Lafitte the
pirate captain and assorted other mistresses, lovers and suspicious
characters said to have once walked these streets.</TE>
<TE>   "On the left, we have Gennifer Flowers' place," says mule driver
Dave Rowe as his carriage full of tourists clip-clops down St. Louis
Street on a Sunday morning. "She is a singer, by the way. Now,
Gennifer, she used to date Bill, when he was governor of Arkansas."
He turns to the tourists with a sly grin. "Aren't I nice?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the club, passersby peer in. They point. They step inside
and gawk.</TE>

<HD>A 71/2-hour game of trivial pursuit</HD>
<DH>Gimmicks, misleading promos, an overdose of crime stories
fill the TV news airwaves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've heard it for decades: We're drowning in local television news
shows that are obsessed with crime and celebrity, the visual and the
visceral. When a Washington-based news-media think tank released its
annual "grades" of local TV news in 17 cities earlier this month, it
gave each of Southern California's three network affiliates low Cs
for their 11 p.m. newscasts. The Project for Excellence in Journalism
criticized the stations for relying too heavily on crime stories,
failing to do sufficient numbers of "enterprise" stories that went
beyond daily events and lacking a commitment to their communities.</LD>
<LD>   But what does a "low C" look like on your screen?</LD>
<LD>   In a decidedly unscientific attempt to answer that question, I sat
down with my remote control on the same day the grades were released
and watched local news from 4 to 11:30 p.m.,I surfed the three
English-language network affiliates and the four VHF independent
stations. What follows is a microcosmic portrait of what we watch,
and what TV journalism in L.A. has become: a world in which the
mundane news of the day is punctuated with bizarre trivia, misleading
promos and, November being a "sweeps" period, a dose of gimmickry.</LD>
<TE>   4--4:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   (KABC-TV Channel 7, KCAL-TV Channel 9)</TE>
<TE>   Rain has begun falling in Northern California and as far south as
Santa Barbara. This is a big story. Not because L.A. is going to get
particularly wet -- forecasts call for intermittent soaking rains of
perhaps one-half to three-quarters of an inch of rain a day during
the next two days, a normal occurrence. No, this is a big story
because it gives the stations an opportunity to showcase their
equipment and troop deployment.</TE>
<TE>   "Using every bit of technology at our disposal," promises
Eyewitness News co-anchor Marc Brown early into KABC's 4 p.m.
broadcast. "Two helicopters, Doppler 7000 radar"-- and weatherman
Dallas Raines.</TE>
<TE>   Raines, strikingly handsome in a dark suit, appears in front of a
video-game-like rear projection that fills the screen. He crouches
athletically so he can gesture toward the South Bay lower on the map.
Colored blotches show approaching rain.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to zoom in closely because we can do this with Live
Doppler 7000," the "real-time" weather system the station introduced
early this year, Raines says. "What's gonna happen over the next
several days?" More rain tonight and tomorrow. Details later. It is
the tease, long the basic staple of TV news, designed to get you to
keep watching until at least the end. The weather can be made into an
even bigger story because it is the first significant moisture of the
year and takes place against the backdrop of major summer brush
fires. Heavy rains could mean mudslides. The stations show fire
fighters filling sandbags, campers bemoaning their ruined vacations
and CHP officers warning people to drive slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Both KABC and KCAL move from rain to a sexual attack in Long
Beach, which may be the latest in a years-long string of assaults by
a serial rapist. KCAL does a troubling story about a darkly dressed
man with a high-powered rifle firing three-dozen shots from the roof
of a school in Rosemead. It takes a full minute before reporter Jay
Jackson explains that (a) this occurred in the middle of the night
and (b) nobody was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   4:10: KABC does its first tease for the 4:30 newscast, hyping an
interview with celebrity-taunting comedian Kathy Griffin, who is
performing locally. ("Her routine is the hottest ticket in town!"
says co-anchor Brown.)</TE>
<TE>   4:15: KABC does a minute-long story on guilty pleas by four
members of the Symbionese Liberation Army in a 1975 murder in a
Sacramento-area bank.</TE>
<TE>   4:22: Another KABC tease for the Kathy Griffin interview. ("She's
got a quick wit and a sharp tongue!" says co-anchor Michelle Tuzee. )</TE>
<TE>   4:25: KABC reports that singer Bobby Brown, whose career has
withered but who still qualifies as a celebrity since he is married
to R&amp;B diva Whitney Houston, has been arrested in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   4:26: A third Kathy Griffin teaser ("...the redhead with the blue
humor," promises the interviewer, entertainment "guru" George
Pennacchio).</TE>
<TE>   KCAL ends its half-hour with the story of a Kentucky woman who
finds, and returns, a $30,000 diamond to its rightful owner. The
station then closes until 8 p.m., advising viewers to switch to
KCBS-TV, which merged its news operations with KCAL this summer. This
used to be unthinkable until the government changed the rules to
allow a single company to own two stations in the same city. With
that relaxation of federal regulations in 1999, this merger--along
with News Corp.'s ownership of KTTV-TV Channel 11 and KCOP-TV Channel
13 -- was permitted.</TE>
<TE>   4:30-5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   (KABC, KCBS-TV</TE>
<TE>   Channel 2)</TE>
<TE>   4:32: In the wake of the Winona Ryder shoplifting verdict, KABC
shows the first pictures of the stolen clothes. The report includes
an interview with a law professor about whether Ryder was prosecuted
properly (19 seconds) and an interview with an entrepreneur selling
"Free Winona" shirts (42 seconds).</TE>
<TE>   4:37: KABC runs its three-minute interview with Kathy Griffin,
showing clips of her onstage jibes. "It's not that you want to [pick
on the pretensions of celebrities]," Pennacchio suggests helpfully
during his interview, "it's that you have to...."</TE>
<TE>   4:40: KABC teases a story on "new hope for people suffering from
multiple sclerosis." In fact, the story will merely note that
pregnancy can temporarily ease the symptoms, and that researchers
would like to develop a drug that mimics that effect.</TE>
<TE>   4:46: KCBS has "breaking news" from its helicopter reporter over
Malibu: a three-car collision, one injured.</TE>
<TE>   4:52: At KABC, Dallas Raines is again standing in front of the
weather map, boasting: "Live Doppler is so powerful we can go right
down to your neighborhood." He stretches east. "Take a look at this,
La Puente. How're you doing? We've got some light rain, South
Hacienda Boulevard along the 60 Freeway."</TE>
<TE>   KABC reporter Henry Alfaro does the weekly "Cool Kid" feature on
an honors student who tutors younger students.</TE>
<TE>   5 -- 6:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   (KABC, KCBS, KNBC-TV Channel 4)</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the three network affiliates go head to head,
reporting the same limited mix of stories: the Long Beach sex
assault, the Rosemead school sniper, the attempted jailhouse suicide
of Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin, the closed-door meeting
between L.A.'s new police chief and African American leaders, the
photos of the Ryder shoplifting evidence, the SLA plea, the first
arrests in an Indonesia terrorist bombing, the government's decision
to try the D.C. sniper suspects in Virginia, the Bobby Brown arrest,
the injury-free belly landing of a small plane in Georgia. And, of
course, the rain, still barely falling in L.A. but receiving several
times more coverage than any other story, despite the meager impact.</TE>
<TE>   TV reporters are dispatched from Santa Barbara to Malibu to
Glendora to the Inland Empire to Mammoth to report and speculate on
the consequences of a normal November rainfall.</TE>
<TE>   At KNBC, co-anchor Paul Moyer will on numerous occasions warn
about the slickness of roads during the first rainfall. During the
opening moments of the 5 p.m. broadcast, Moyer observes: "Santa
Barbara usually gets hit the hardest and first and, by golly, that's
what's happening right now. We can report it's raining in Santa
Barbara."</TE>
<TE>   5:14: Moyer introduces reporter Laurel Erickson's story about
child prostitution in Hollywood. This is, he intones, "a crisis that
might even put your child at risk." The report turns out to be a
feature on Children of the Night, which works with runaways usually
drawn to L.A. from other parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, KABC runs a commercial touting Live Doppler 7000:
"Everyone else's weather is just old news."</TE>
<TE>   5:24: KABC's Raines proclaims, "We're zooming in right now, near
Agoura," while KCBS is running its "Health Beat" segment about "Sex
and the City" co-star Kim Cattrall's support of a program to keep
tabs on pets during disasters. A minute later KNBC runs its Bobby
Brown story, including his comments, and tells viewers they can get
more if they tune into "Access Hollywood" at 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   5:28: KABC reports that the arrest of a suspect in the sexual
assault of a teenage girl is being credited to a new state law that
required a DNA sample when the suspect was incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   5:32: Most stations ignore politics, but KCBS runs Linda
Breakstone's 1:50 report on onetime L.A. mayoral candidate Anthony
Villaraigosa's announcement he'll run for City Council, and the
"carpetbagger" charges that accompany it.</TE>
<TE>   5:33: KNBC's weatherman, Fritz Coleman, announces "real-time"
rainfall data from Ventura County: in Thousand Oaks, .02 inches.</TE>
<TE>   5:35: KNBC co-anchor Chuck Henry teases a story about "the link
between this restaurant" -- a McDonald's -- "and exploding razors."
When the actual story is broadcast 18 minutes later, the restaurant
will turn out to be in Brunswick, N.Y., and involve a razor found in
a restroom.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, KNBC covers a high school walkout in
Southwest Los Angeles to protest class schedules and the state's
"exit exam." It lasts 23 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   At 5:46 and then again at 6:08, KNBC teases a story about frantic
911 calls in a recent huge freeway pileup, promising to tell why many
calls were not answered. When the actual story is broadcast at 6:11,
the reason will turn out to be the volume of calls.</TE>
<TE>   5:48: KCBS co-anchor Harold Greene teases tonight's 11 p.m. expose
on handicapped-parking fraud by students at UCLA. Some of the
stations' most audacious enterprise reporting tends to be programmed
during these sweep periods, in which ratings determine future
advertising rates. This afternoon's tease footage includes a UCLA
student making an obscene finger gesture at a reporter. "No, UCLA
isn't really No. 1, son," Greene says disapprovingly. "We'll have
more on this tonight."</TE>
<TE>   6:00: The rain will not cooperate with the foreboding tone of
tonight's weather coverage. "It's really a pretty pleasant rain
unless you have to drive in it," reports KABC Air 7's Scott Reiff.</TE>
<TE>   6:01: On KNBC, Coleman updates "real-time" rain data. Thousand
Oaks now has .03 inches, a gain of .01 inches in 26 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   6:15: KNBC's "For Your Money" is a three-minute report on buying
affordable wine, followed by a tease to the station's key 11 p.m.
story: an unnamed fish (escolar) that is making some people ill.
"What is this mystery on the menu?" the station asks. The story will
be teased again in nine minutes.</TE>
<TE>   There is no local news from 6:30 to 8 p.m., and only one newscast
until 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   8--10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   (KCAL)</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because KCAL has the turf to itself, it can afford to
offer more dignified, meat-and-potatoes journalism during the
following two hours. Most of the stories the other stations have
covered are presented, but so is a 3:10 spot on the impact of
Tuesday's Republican mid-term-election victories by KCAL's veteran
political reporter, Dave Bryan.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan's story leads the 9 p.m. hour and is followed with the
evening's only real "breaking" news -- a Corona policeman shot by a
suspected parole violator.</TE>
<TE>   9:05: KCAL runs the day's best piece on the guilty pleas of four
ex-SLA members, which is about as long as KNBC's piece on affordable
wine.</TE>
<TE>   9:35: KCAL runs the KCBS Villaraigosa story.</TE>
<TE>   10-11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   (KCAL, KTLA-TV Channel 5, KTTV Channel 11)</TE>
<TE>   The three independent stations shift between rain and the Corona
shooting. KTLA (owned by Tribune Co., which also owns the Los Angeles
Times) carries an "exclusive" Warren Wilson interview with a mother
who hopes her son, a murder suspect, will surrender. KCAL runs its
much-teased special on legislation to curb telemarketing. KTTV runs
six minutes on a woman believed to have been murdered for testifying
against a drug dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Three times -- at 10:41, 10:49 and 10:52 -- longtime KTLA anchor
Hal Fishman teases a 10:55 story on a cat-trick contest won by a cat
who can drink from a water cooler. "A pretty cool cat," Fishman
concludes.</TE>
<TE>   11--11:35 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   (KABC, KCBS, KNBC, KCOP-TV Channel 13)</TE>
<TE>   The longest and arguably the best story of the day -- replete with
outrage and confrontation -- is KCBS' handicapped parking expose. It
airs at 11:07. "They arrive without crutches or wheelchairs ...
convenience without conscience," reporter Randy Paige begins. He
confronts students who use expired or borrowed "handicapped" placards
or fake injuries to get them. Then, after four minutes, Paige teases
his own story, promising a hidden-camera look at a crooked
chiropractor -- five minutes from now.</TE>
<TE>   The second segment, which runs another four minutes, features
hidden-camera conversations between a KCBS producer who is diagnosed
with back problems by the chiropractor despite no apparent
disability. The spot ends with an on-camera, "60 Minutes"-style
ambush interview at a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, KCOP probes the sexual exploitation of children in
Tijuana and reports on how making love is more sensual with an
article of clothing left on. KCBS reports about crack cocaine sales
in Hollywood and includes a pledge by new Police Chief Bill Bratton
to clean it up. KNBC runs its escolar expose (Japan has banned it,
the U.S. hasn't).</TE>
<TE>   At 11:29, KABC's Dallas Raines offers this: "I think by tomorrow
morning, most of the streets will be wet in Southern California."</TE>

<HD>Curator Copperfield</HD>
<DH>Dozens of the magician's priceless and irreplaceable
artifacts from his own collection will be on display in Hollywood.</DH>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>It's the middle of the night, and David Copperfield is exploring the
rooms where the ghosts live.</LD>
<LD>   It often happens when Copperfield, arguably the world's most
famous magician, is staying at the massive industrial warehouse that
serves as his headquarters and home when he is not on his relentless
international touring schedule. He will find it hard to sleep, and,
wandering around in his robe, he winds up in an immaculately designed
room filled with strange wonders.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, an animatronic figure -- a wind-up mechanical man in a
glass case -- begins to silently wave his small baton without
warning. Shadows seem to move in and about the hundreds of framed
vintage posters of legendary magicians hanging on the walls. As
Copperfield moves around, Charlie McCarthy, the wooden partner of
ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, sits in a chair, taking in the eerie
atmosphere.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know why these things seem to move just by themselves,"
Copperfield says. "They just do."</TE>
<TE>   Though Copperfield is best known for his glitzy stage shows and
the elaborate live TV productions in which he made the Statue of
Liberty, an airplane and a 70-ton Orient Express train vanish, it is
in these hidden and locked rooms where the more introspective and
private artist finds sanctuary and inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   These rooms contain possibly the world's largest magic museum,
filled with priceless and irreplaceable artifacts on the history and
art of magic from around the world. More than 80,000 items are housed
in the private museum, which Copperfield has christened the
International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Among its more valuable pieces are Harry Houdini's Metamorphosis
Trunk, the first ever employed in the illusion of disappearances;
coins that Wyman the Wizard used to pass through President Lincoln's
hands; the Chung Ling Soo rifle, believed to be the weapon used when
the Chinese magician performed his notorious bullet-catching trick
one too many times; and props used by Channing Pollock, the magician
frequently featured on the Ed Sullivan show who would produce doves
out of thin air. Also included in the museum are 15,000 magic books,
some from the 16th century.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is off-limits to all but the magician's admired
colleagues, fellow magicians and serious collectors. But this month,
Copperfield is taking some of the ghosts on tour.</TE>
<TE>   When Copperfield performs this weekend at Hollywood's Kodak
Theatre, he will be bringing dozens of his most prized museum pieces
with him for display in the lobby. Though a few of the items have
been shown at other Copperfield engagements, the Kodak display is
much larger and will mark the first -- and only -- time most of the
pieces will be available for public viewing.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of the Kodak came because it's such an amazing place,"
Copperfield said recently between shows at the MGM Grand, where he
performs several times a year. "I haven't played Los Angeles in the
middle of the city for more than 10 years, so I thought this might be
good for the return. Plus it's Hollywood, and I will be bringing
several pieces that are directly linked."</TE>
<TE>   The display will include Orson Welles' buzz-saw illusion, which he
designed for Rita Hayworth and used in a live performance with
Marlene Dietrich. A few Charlie McCarthys will be present, including
a frowning dummy from the film "Fun and Fancy Free."</TE>
<TE>   The Houdini trunk, the Chung Ling Soo rifle and artifacts from
Dante, Wyman Hermann and several other legendary magicians will also
be shown. The display is expected to take up most of the lobbies of
the theater, which is best known as the home of the Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Said Copperfield: "I want people coming to see my magic, but that
there is also a historical background that is very rich." But he is a
bit uncomfortable about taking many of the priceless pieces out of
their controlled environment.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a great deal of fear about this," said Copperfield, only
half-jokingly. "Many of the larger pieces, like Orson Welles' saw,
are not going to be under glass, just behind a velvet rope. We are
moving them very, very carefully."</TE>
<TE>   The image of Copperfield as obsessive scholar and magic historian
runs a bit counter to his image as a slick, modern-day conjurer and
jet-setting celebrity who romances glamorous women such as ex-flame
Claudia Schiffer. But his devotion to preserving the history of magic
is one of his primary obsessions. He has spent millions of dollars
purchasing and housing entire collections, including the private Cole
Collection, the largest in the United Kingdom, and constructing the
museum, which is climate-controlled and meticulously maintained.</TE>
<TE>   As Copperfield gives a tour of his museum, his enthusiasm is
infectious, his demeanor closer to that of a hyper schoolboy than a
magician known for his no-nonsense perfectionism. He started
collecting about 10 years ago. "I've become quite passionate about
it," he says. "I have always been interested in pushing magic
forward. But when I began to see how these guys were all trying to do
the same thing, I just fell in love with it. I really appreciate the
legacy."</TE>
<TE>   But the history also informs him and fuels his desire to innovate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really trying hard not to do anything that has been done
before," he said. "So knowing everything I can about the legacy of
magic challenges my team and I to invent new illusions. For me to
grow, I have to know about the foundation that came before."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what his most prized treasure is, Copperfield referred to a
three-year series of letters exchanged between Houdini and fellow
magician Harry Kellar, known as the Great Kellar, in which they
traded barbs, concepts and opinions. He finds them particularly
insightful and exciting.</TE>
<TE>   He still covets a few items, one of which he'll never get. He says
he really wanted Houdini's Water Torture Chamber, which had been
housed in Paris, but the contraption was destroyed in a fire.</TE>
<TE>   There is another treasure so prized that Copperfield will not even
reveal what it is: "It's in Paris, and that's all I want to say,
because I don't want to tip anyone else off."</TE>
<TE>   The magician is continuing to tour and develop new illusions for
stage and a TV special. And when the time comes -- if he wishes --
Copperfield will be able to build a museum devoted to his own career.</TE>
<TE>   In another part of the vast Las Vegas warehouse are several large
rooms where Copperfield keeps all the props, wardrobes, illusions and
machinery used in his shows. Each of his stage performances over the
last 15 years is on videotape, and his fan letters and other
memorabilia are carefully categorized and preserved.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, his magic museum remains a priority.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like the legacy of cinema, with people like Victor
Fleming and Orson Welles," he said. "It's good for us to know the
history and to appreciate the richness of such a unique past. It is
truly exciting to me."</TE>

<LD>Dude, it's Silo (Joe Absolom) -- yeah, man, how ya doin'? I just got
back from Australia -- I mean, Austria -- yeah, which is somewhere,
uh, near Germany, which is like in Europe and it was awesome! Yeah,
there were these mountains and drops and there was this director guy
(Rufus Sewell), who, like, hired me and some other boarders to shoot
this commercial for some sort of digital video camera for some
Japanese company, which is, you know, cool.</LD>
<LD>   So, me and these other boarders, this twisted punk chick Kittie
(Jana Pallaske), this loser Will (Devon Sawa) and this uptight Suzy
Chapstick-type (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) -- hot but frosty, you
know? -- we're, like, in this commercial and racing ahead of -- get
this -- an avalanche! But then, like, I don't know, these nasty
Serbian dudes showed up at this hotel we're staying in and they start
waving guns around -- dude, it was like some MTV gangsta stuff -- and
chasing us with a helicopter! It was wack -- I didn't know what was
going on!</LD>
<TE>   Wait, man, there's more. There was this other guy, this dude
Christian Duguay, and he was actually, like, the real director of
this, uh, movie we're in. Yeah, man, I wasn't there for a commercial,
I was, like, in a movie! Yeah, some writer dude, I think his name
was, uh, Michael Zaidan, was supposed to have like written the
screenplay or something, but, dude, the only thing that I ever saw
that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   Dude, one last thing: If you see my moms and pops, definitely
don't tell them about this. They'd kill me if they found out that all
I did in this flick was just ride, check out the honeys, drink some
cold ones and, like, almost break my neck flying off some mountain! I
mean, dude, snowboards and Serbs -- what more could you want?! Sweet!</TE>

<LD>Wes Craven may be "presenting" and Dimension Films may be
distributing "They," but this tepid, mechanical stab at terror falls
below the standard set by the veteran horrormeister and the
distribution company that has become synonymous with smart, amusing
fright fests like "Scream." For that matter, "They" can't compare
with director Robert Harmon's ultra-grisly but genuinely scary "The
Hitcher" of 16 years ago, which cast Rutger Hauer as the hitchhiker
from hell.</LD>
<LD>   Writer Brendan William Hood seems to have confused ambiguity,
which can be unsettling, with the merely vague. Spunky Laura Regan,
in spite of the material, delivers a focused portrayal as Julia, a
Manhattan grad student. Julia is preparing to defend her master's
thesis in psychology when a long-troubled childhood friend, Billy
(Jon Abrahams), pops up in a desperate state of mind. Billy believes
that he and Julia and others who have a history of childhood
nightmares and terrors were being targeted then to be taken over
later in life by aliens.</LD>
<LD>   Naturally, our master's candidate tries to resist this notion but
becomes convinced she is in great danger. None of these developments
evolve with force or conviction, and "They" never generates any real
fear until its last minutes, by which time it is too late to redeem
the dull events that preceded them.</LD>

<HD>Viacom tries to give up control of KFWB</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With radio stations, a format change usually closely follows an
ownership change. But if the Federal Communications Commission
approves a shift in who controls KFWB-AM (980), surprisingly little
different is expected on the air or behind the scenes.</LD>
<LD>   The station's parent company, communications giant Viacom Inc.,
asked the FCC last week to place all-news KFWB in an "independent and
irrevocable trust," according to FCC spokeswoman Michelle Russo.
Viacom was forced to give up one of its Los Angeles properties after
the FCC approved its purchase of KCAL-TV in May.</LD>
<LD>   That gave the company two television and seven radio stations in
L.A., one more than FCC rules allow in a single market, and the
agency gave the company six months to divest. So Viacom, instead of
selling a station outright, is asking to turn over control to trustee
Bill Clark, former chief executive of Shamrock Broadcasting, who has
overseen a couple of stations previously as a Viacom trustee, said
company spokesman Dana McClintock.</LD>
<TE>   If the trust is approved, Viacom officials can have no contact
with the station and instead would pay Clark to run it. "I'd be happy
to have any and all input from him," said KFWB general manager Roger
Nadel. "He has a great track record."</TE>
<TE>   McClintock wouldn't say why KFWB was chosen. It does, however,
somewhat duplicate Viacom's other all-news station, KNX-AM (1070).</TE>
<TE>   By not selling KFWB, Viacom may be biding its time until early
next year, when the FCC is expected to announce new rules for
ownership caps. Observers suspect that the current commission --
which is seen as less inclined to regulate than to let market forces
control the industry -- will relax its limits, and Viacom could once
again take control of KFWB.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC has already granted Viacom dispensation on its television
stations, which reach about 39% of the national audience. The current
limit is 35%, but in April the FCC said Viacom doesn't have to shed
TV stations until a year after the agency's new rules are approved --
again, if the ownership caps aren't eased.</TE>
<TE>   But the KFWB trust has yet to gain FCC approval, which spokeswoman
Russo said is "not a normal, rubber-stamping kind of thing. We'll
have to look at the specific terms of the trust." She had no
timetable for when the agency might even take up the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Nadel said he doesn't foresee any changes on the
horizon, no matter whom he'll report to.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the company operates, it's managed locally on a
day-to-day basis anyway," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he's been with the company 26 years, and feels he
has the best interests of the station and listeners in mind. "I
expect to be here for the duration."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Radio satirist Hendrie is taking his act to TV</TE>
<TE>   Not just the voices in his head: In the prime-time comedy he's
creating for NBC television, radio satirist Phil Hendrie will still
be arguing with lunatics and societal misfits. But, for a change, he
won't be the only one talking. On Hendrie's program, heard on about
100 stations, including KFI-AM (640) from 7 to 10 weeknights, he
parodies talk radio by performing both as host and as each of the
dozens of bizarre characters he interviews, all to get a rise out of
unsuspecting callers.</TE>
<TE>   They rail at the out-of-bounds views of his "guests," such as a
Catholic priest rationalizing molestation, or a housewife who brags
about being hip and using ecstasy with her kids. "There's no way you
can take my radio show and translate it to TV," Hendrie said. "What I
do here on the air is create characters, and there's really not a big
difference between that and creating a good TV show. I know how to
write characters and I know how to write funny, and I'll take that
over to television."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, NBC announced it has paired Hendrie with writer Peter
Tolan to create the series. Tolan's screenwriting credits include
"Analyze That," "Analyze This," "America's Sweethearts" and "The
Larry Sanders Show," and he also co-created the ABC comedy "The Job"
with Denis Leary.</TE>
<TE>   NBC Senior Vice President Shelley McCrory said a strength of
Hendrie's radio show is his ability to make social observations
through his outrageous characters, something she hopes to see
repeated in the television program, slated for the fall 2003 season.
"He's an incredible performer," she said. "I had been listening to
the show for a while and was just mesmerized. What we wanted to do
was get his brain."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrie will play a retired police officer, married to a woman
with a teenager from a previous marriage, who moves to a gated
community looking for safety and tranquillity. There he'll be the
calm center in a storm of bizarre characters, such as homeowners'
association presidents, whom he calls "suburban cultural dictators,"
in a show he hopes will look at post-Sept. 11 America and prick "the
illusion that we can continue as a freewheeling middle-class
society."</TE>
<TE>   "We want freedom and we want security," he said -- freedom to
stroll around on a private golf course, and security from outsiders
who might wander in. "You can't have both of those worlds without an
enormous amount of hilarious conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not looking to change the world," Hendrie said, "but there's
so much to comment on."</TE>

<HD>Maybe it really was the perfect theft</HD>
<DH>After a recent flurry of excitement, the trail has again
cooled on a missing Jan Van Eyck panel stolen in 1934.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Raf Casert</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GHENT, Belgium</DL>
<LD>Even though the painting has not been seen since 1934, it is becoming
more popular by the day.</LD>
<LD>   It is almost 70 years since the disappearance of a panel scarred
one of Western art's defining works. Now the theft of Jan Van Eyck's
"Just Judges" is taking on ever more mythic proportions.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery only increased after a much publicized hunt for the
highlight of Flemish primitive painting ended in disappointment last
month when a secret cache in a northern Belgium church turned out to
be empty.</LD>
<TE>   "It is our monster of Loch Ness," said Patrick Bernauw, who has
written a book on the theft. "When it wasn't found last month, the
myth just reinforced itself a little bit more."</TE>
<TE>   The search captured front pages throughout Belgium and beyond, and
the probe in the church was carried live on radio. Television
broadcasts opened their news on location, and a Web site set up to
highlight the discovery crashed under the weight of 75,000 hits a
day.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, a determined bunch of amateur detectives has picked
up where police left off many years ago. For many, the concept is
just too enticing: It unites a stupendous piece of art and a great
detective story.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-panel "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb," completed in 1432,
offers a translucent use of color created by layer upon layer of oils
and mystical meaning. The "Just Judges" panel depicts 10 men on
horseback on their way to venerate the Holy Lamb.</TE>
<TE>   The panel was stolen along with a lesser panel on April 10, 1934,
from St. Bavo Cathedral. Soon after, extortion letters sent to the
bishop of Ghent demanded $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Any sleuth who could solve the crime would become an instant hero,
a savior of a piece of national heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Retired cabdriver Gaston De Roeck was convinced this summer that
he would become that hero. He boldly proclaimed on his Web site that
he knew where the "Just Judges" panel of Van Eyck's "Adoration" was
hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many before him, he had intimately studied the life of the
presumed thief, Arsene Goedertier, who collapsed from a stroke seven
months after the theft and uttered his last famous words: "Only I
know where the 'Adoration' is."</TE>
<TE>   De Roeck dissected the 13 extortion letters for $25,000 in ransom,
a huge sum at the time, which were sent to the local bishop's office.
The cabdriver decided the panel had to be hidden in the church of
Goedertier's hometown of Wetteren, just outside this Gothic city.</TE>
<TE>   So De Roeck called in police on Oct. 4 to keep the curious at a
safe distance. It only increased his disappointment when he came up
empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, up to 2,000 visitors a day go to the Gothic church in
the center of town where Van Eyck's "Adoration" is encased in 2
inches of reinforced glass to prevent another theft.</TE>
<TE>   "Many come see the painting for something which is no longer
there," said author Bernauw. "That is almost art in itself."</TE>

<HD>Noyce's 'Fence' is built around racial divide in
Australia's past</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An old-fashioned weepie tucked inside a fiercely indicting political
thriller, Phillip Noyce's "Rabbit-Proof Fence" opens in the early
1930s along a stretch of red Australian dust called Jigalong. Located
in the western part of the continent, Jigalong was a depot for the
transcontinental fence built by the government after the turn of the
century to protect agricultural lands from a plague of rabbits. Years
after the fence was erected, Jigalong had become little more than a
holding station for the area's indigenous people, including
14-year-old Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi) and her two young cousins,
Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and Gracie (Laura Monaghan), all three
fathered and abandoned by white workers.</LD>
<TE>   The fence was one more marker of an already divided country. By
the early 20th century, Australian Aborigines had been herded onto
separate lands where their lives, including the right to marry and to
work, were under the complete authority of the white government.
Biracial children were of particular interest, since the government
looked at them as a potential source of cheap labor that could be
absorbed into the white population. "Sixty years ago," said one
official in 1937, "there were over 60,000 full-blooded natives in
Western Australia. Today, there are only 20,000. In time, there would
be none." To that end, from about 1910 to 1970, an estimated 10% of
children were removed, often permanently, from their homes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1931, Molly Craig and her cousins, ages 8 and 10, became part
of what's known as Australia's "stolen generations" when they were
spirited away from their family to a white-run dormitory 1,500 miles
south of Jigalong. Dormitory, though, is too polite a word for the
Dickensian nightmare painted by the filmmakers. Warehoused in
clapboard shacks, the children were denied their customs and language
("We don't use that jabber here," scolds one of the white nurses) in
an effort to strip the black out of them. Under constant guard, they
labored at sewing tables during the day, while at night they slept in
filthy bedding, using a communal slop pail for a privy. One of the
crueler ironies of the children's captivity, as meted out in Noyce's
film, is that if a child had the temerity to escape the camp, it was
an Aboriginal man armed with a whip who was sent to bring the runaway
back.</TE>
<TE>   Molly lasted just one day. Taking hold of her cousins, the
prepossessed 14-year-old headed for home -- by foot. For three
months, the girls hid from trackers (one of whom is played by David
Gulpilil, the Aboriginal boy from "Walkabout"), covering their
footprints, sleeping in rabbit warrens, scavenging for something to
eat and begging food off of sympathetic white female farmers. The
journey was as unrelenting as the terrain and the will of the white
authorities, the latter of which Noyce overplays to the point of
parody, particularly in the characterization of the children's
government protector, Mr. Neville (Kenneth Branagh). As the film's
embodiment of Australia's racist past, this Social Darwinist spends
much of his time reciting variations on the line, "in spite of
himself, the native must be helped." All that's missing is a waxed
mustache to twirl.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a book by Molly's daughter, Doris Pilkington, and written
for the screen by Christine Olsen, "Rabbit-Proof Fence" is the first
film Noyce has directed in his home country since his 1989 nail-biter
"Dead Calm." In the years following, Noyce made the move to
Hollywood, where he directed a series of progressively anonymous
action movies, the most noteworthy of which starred Harrison Ford as
Jack Ryan, first in "Patriot Games," then in "Clear and Present
Danger." Those were the high points. Otherwise, it was a gilded slide
into the abyss with "Sliver," "The Saint" and his last major-studio
outing, "The Bone Collector," in which Denzel Washington played a
homicide detective who was also a quadriplegic principally, or so it
appeared, so he couldn't get his hands on co-star Angelina Jolie.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bone Collector" makes a startling contrast to the features
Noyce has since directed, including the recent "The Quiet American."
As with his adaptation of the Graham Greene novel, this new film is a
genuine pursuit of seriousness -- it is, simply put, about something.
Among other things, these are films about power and about the burden
of history, as it weighs down not merely the oppressed but also those
who bend it to their will. In this sense, "Rabbit-Proof Fence" serves
as unassailable proof of Noyce's good intentions, even if as a
political statement it's at once over- and under-cooked, with little
memorable dialogue and neither enough moral or political nuance.</TE>
<TE>   The young actresses who play the fugitives, all newcomers,
shoulder the story confidently, their solemn quiet a relief from
Branagh's gnashing villainy. You understand the director's rage, but
in making Neville the story's chief repository of evil, Noyce and the
screenwriter have effectively diluted the ferocity of their argument,
turning a country's shame into one madman's mission. The frequent
cutaways to Neville are more distracting than illuminating so that,
in the end, what keeps the film on course is the relentlessness of
the girls' determination, as it's both framed by cinematographer
Christopher Doyle, who carves mood and feeling from the landscape,
and tenderly guided by Noyce. When Molly, Daisy and Gracie break into
a heart-pounding run, you are reminded that not everything the
director did in Hollywood was rubbish.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the government released a report on the forced removal of
Aboriginal children which concluded that its past policies actually
met the definition of genocide. That hasn't sat well with some of the
country's white residents, a number of whom greeted Noyce's film with
noisy protest when it opened in Australia earlier this year. Local
newspapers churned with rebuttals from protesters who denied both the
extremity of the removal and its assimilationist intentions on the
grounds that either Aboriginal children needed to be protected from
their families or had been willingly handed over to white
authorities. Even the film's tagline ("What if the government
kidnapped your daughter?") elicited official condemnation. Noyce,
meanwhile, has stood firm. In his own modest fashion, he too has gone
home.</TE>

<HD>Comedy and musicals make a theater merry</HD>
<DH>Holiday productions keep the season light with an offbeat
'Mulholland,' a Judy Garland sing-alike and some sophisticated
British humor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two wacky original musicals and a caustic British comedy swell the
already bountiful offerings of holiday-themed shows this Christmas
season.</LD>
<LD>   If you're in the mood for the purely odd, try William Robens' "A
Mulholland Christmas Carol" at Theatre of NOTE. An offbeat reworking
of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," the musical recasts Ebenezer Scrooge
as Los Angeles water czar William Mulholland (Greg Wall), a grasping,
covetous old sinner who gloats over his hoard of water, not gold. The
water puns get a bit belabored. However, toothy Teddy Roosevelt
(David Conner) makes a bully appearance as the Ghost of Christmas
Present, while affable Dean Lemont is an appealing young Scrooge --
uh, make that Mulholland.</LD>
<LD>   Although Robens assures us in the program notes that his play is
not meant to be historically accurate, too much time is spent
expounding on the particulars of Los Angeles' transition from burg to
metropolis. Fortunately, a lively, hummable score, written primarily
by Robens, keeps the overlong first act flowing. Musical director
Bill Newlin fronts the excellent live band, and director Kiff Scholl
encourages his big, bombastic cast to be as broad as it can be --
which is very broad indeed.</LD>
<TE>   Act One is only intermittently funny, but Act Two progresses from
the laborious to the uproarious with the introduction of the Van
Norman (i.e. Cratchit) family and a side-splitting, partly puppet
Poquito Pablito (Terry Tocantins), the Tiny Tim of the piece. From
that point on, the show takes off like a bottle rocket. The climax --
the 1928 collapse of the St. Francis Dam -- is a hilariously cheesy
debacle of pocket-Bible proportions that segues, dramatic license
permitting, into an up-tempo happy ending. Whatever possessed Robens
and his confederates to come up with this goofy premise is anyone's
guess. You have to wonder -- but you have to laugh.</TE>
<TE>   If you're in the mood for a holiday bargain, you can get four
shows for the price of one in "Judy's Scary Little Christmas" at the
Victory Theatre. That's not always good. Joe Patrick Ward's witty
score and a terrific cast are a frequently magical combination.</TE>
<TE>   However, the scattershot book by James Webber and David Church
wavers wildly in tone, ranging from side-splitting parody to
contrived suspense story to bafflingly downbeat denouement.</TE>
<TE>   The action is set on a CBS sound stage in 1959, where Judy Garland
(the wonderful Connie Champagne) is taping her Christmas special.
Recovering from a recent brush with death, Judy has a lot riding on
this show, and she's hoping show-biz pals Bing Crosby (Sean Smith),
Liberace (Don Lucas), Joan Crawford (Joanne O'Brien) and Ethel Merman
(Lauri Johnson) will help her put things over. Unfortunately,
"special guests" Richard M. Nixon (a wickedly funny Eric Anderson)
and Lillian Hellman (Jan Sheldrick), bristling antagonists, threaten
to derail Judy's comeback.</TE>
<TE>   An eventual leap into the otherworldly is forced and shoddily set
up. Also, Church and Webber too often bend their plot to accommodate
a gag. A case in point is Hellman's unlikely appearance on Judy's
show.</TE>
<TE>   However, the subsequent duet between Nixon and Hellman -- a high
point -- almost makes us forget the initial contrivance. Making the
most of the material, the cast sparkles throughout. In fact, these
performer/impersonators are so dead-on that you want to package them
and present them to your friends.</TE>
<TE>   If you like your comedy more sophisticated and thematically
cohesive, "Season's Greetings," by prolific British playwright Alan
Ayckbourn, will ring your Christmas chimes.</TE>
<TE>   Sly, subtle and smartly executed, the production marks the Company
Rep's last offering at the El Portal's Circle Theatre before the
company's move to the nearby American Renegade Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The action takes place in the home of Neville Bunker (Daniel
Sapecky) and his wife, Belinda (Heather Simmons), who are hosting a
full house of relatives and friends over the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   As realized by Ron Slanina, the warm, handsomely decked-out set is
ideal for a cozy, old-fashioned Christmas. However, in typical
Ayckbourn fashion, the characters soon prove so boozy, over-sexed and
generally fractious that the holidays degenerate into a series of
increasingly outlandish calamities.</TE>
<TE>   Director Jules Aaron renders Ayckbourn's deliciously dour portrait
with a fine hand. It's hard to single out anyone in this uniformly
top-notch cast, but Simmons and Slanina strike sparks as would-be
adulterers whose dalliance is spectacularly disrupted, while Stuart
Thompson shines as a boorish old poop whose epic puppet shows are the
bane of everyone's holiday.</TE>

<KH>ALL THAT JAZZ</KH>
<HD>Programming the Reeves way</HD>
<DH>The Philharmonic's first Creative Chair for Jazz explains
the thought process that went into her choices for shows at Disney
Hall, the Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dianne Reeves is approaching her two-year appointment as the Los
Angeles Philharmonic's first Creative Chair for Jazz with the same
sort of grit and determination that have characterized her career as
a jazz singer.</LD>
<LD>   "I come from a place where you make a way out of no way," Reeves
says. "And when you make that way, you make it big enough for other
people to come through. That's what I stand on, because that's what
has worked for me, ever since I was just a kid, trying to make it in
Denver, which only had the remnants of a jazz scene when I was coming
up. But once I found my way, once I found my voice, I also found my
uniqueness as an artist."</LD>
<LD>   Reeves is hoping that she will similarly find her way in her
position, which essentially involves creating and planning jazz
programming for the new Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Hollywood
Bowl, for the 2003 and 2004 seasons.</LD>
<TE>   "My first goal was to build a foundation," she says. "I thought
the best way to do that would be to start out with musicians who were
the architects of jazz music, as well as younger, emerging talent.
But, in addition, I wanted to have players from Los Angeles, because
there are so many talented people here, I wanted to commission new
works, and I wanted to have extensive educational programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, I wanted to do something that would encompass all of
those things, and include things with the Philharmonic, as well.
Because one of the things I liked about all this, from the very
beginning, was the possibility of blurring the line between jazz
music and classical music and world music, and to make it one
experience."</TE>
<TE>   The first concrete evidence of Reeves' planning was presented to
the public last week with the announcement of the initial jazz events
at Disney Hall, planned for the opening season. Four scheduled
programs include appearances by the Keith Jarrett Trio (with Gary
Peacock and Jack DeJohnette), Herbie Hancock (in an evening dedicated
to his take on the music of George Gershwin), the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra led by Wynton Marsalis, and Reeves herself, with
keyboardist George Duke and guest artists. The Hancock and Reeves
programs will also include the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the relative conservatism of the opening lineup, which
-- aside from her own presence -- seems to take few chances, Reeves
responded with her rationale for each of the entries.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted Keith because he's had a continuing commitment to
acoustic music," she says. "All the other great halls I've ever gone
to -- Carnegie Hall, etc. -- people always talk about the fact that
you can almost hear Mahler or Beethoven in the very walls of the
room, and I thought this would be an opportunity to bathe Disney Hall
in Keith's sound."</TE>
<TE>   Reeves notes that Hancock's 1998 recording "Gershwin's World" has
never been performed in a symphonic setting. "And what was also
special," she adds, "is that he wanted to do material that was not
just from the album, but a very broad evening with an emphasis on
Gershwin."</TE>
<TE>   Marsalis' presence in the opening season was, according to Reeves,
urged by the Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a very good relationship with Wynton," she explains.
"Especially after he did 'All Rise' with the Philharmonic right after
Sept. 11, and they wanted to continue to work with him, which was
fine with me. I'm not sure what the programming will be, as yet, but
I think there's something special in the works."</TE>
<TE>   Reeves believes that her own presence on the season is
understandable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my program, and I feel that I should be a part of it, so
that people can see and understand that I'm very committed to what
I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   Reeves adds that she also will do at least one high-visibility
event at the Hollywood Bowl next summer and will be the host of as
many events as her schedule will allow.</TE>
<TE>   Her approach raises the perhaps unanswerable question of whether
the function of the creative chair is best served by a well-known
artist or by a professional curator-presenter. Each choice has its
merits and its problems. Artists bring powerful familiarity with the
performing process as well as an extensive web of creative
connections.</TE>
<TE>   But that web of associates and acquaintances inevitably tends to
include many who will understandably expect to be near the top of the
list for potential participation in concerts. Although the schedule
for next summer's Bowl events is still to be determined, it
apparently will include music and musicians well within the orbit of
Reeves' interests -- as was the programming for the Bowl when John
Clayton was in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anything wrong with reflecting the music that appeals
to me," Reeves says, "or including players I respect and value, so
long as I manage to keep the integrity of jazz music a part of all
the programming. I can't say anything about specific artists, yet,
but ... I'd like to do something acknowledging the connection between
jazz and Hollywood. I love gospel music, which I hope will show up
somewhere, and there's always something to do in the area of jazz
fusion. And, like so many other musicians, I deeply value the
connection between jazz and Brazilian music, and we're hoping to
offer something special in that area."</TE>
<TE>   Reeves is presumably less familiar with the fiscal and marketing
aspects of her role than a professional curator-presenter would be.
But she insists that she is well aware that tickets must be sold and
seats must be filled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm learning that there are some shows that make other shows
possible," she admits. "That's just the way of the world. I know that
selling tickets is important, without anyone at the Philharmonic
having to tell me." For Reeves, who proudly announces that through
dieting and working out, she has trimmed 60 pounds in the past year,
her work with the Philharmonic is a task that is daunting, yet
manageable.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to look at it this way," Reeves concludes. "It's like
another day at the gym. My gym practice has taught me that some days

<TE>   Riffs: The newly launched Audio Fidelity label is kicking off its
first batch of releases with three jazz albums in the new
dual-layered Hybrid SACD format. Each of the items is a jazz classic,
remixed and remastered in the multi-track SACD format (which is
compatible with existing CD players): Cal Tjader's "Latin+Jazz,"
Buddy Rich's "The Best Band I Ever Had" and Mel Torme's "The London
Sessions" ... The Pasadena Jazz Orchestra gives its premiere
performance Dec. 8 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, performing the
Duke Ellington-Billy Strayhorn arrangements of Tchaikovsky's
"Nutcracker Suite." According to Paul Lines, executive director of
the Pasadena Jazz Institute, the event will serve as a trial run for
the establishment of the 15-piece ensemble as a continuing musical
entity.</TE>

<HD>Nasty displays of screen rage</HD>
<DH>Characters with anger management issues are erupting on
film and TV. Maybe it's a reflection of our world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Deborah Hornblow</AU>
<BD>Hartford Courant</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an early scene in P.T. Anderson's film "Punch-Drunk Love," Barry
Egan, the character played by Adam Sandler, struggles to control his
temper. He has been teased by his sisters, all seven of whom take
turns calling him names and meddling in his personal affairs. The
camera cuts away from Sandler's Barry for an instant and then we hear
the sound of shattering glass. He has kicked in his sister's sliding
glass doors. Egan is the most vivid example of a character who is
erupting all over screens big and small. It is the character with
anger-management issues, the one who cannot control his temper, bite
her tongue or keep his fists to himself.</LD>
<LD>   Catherine Keener plays an unhappy mother and wife in "Lovely &amp;
Amazing," a woman who responds to rejection by muttering angry
expletives.</LD>
<LD>   In "Mostly Martha," Martina Gedeck is a perfectionist chef who has
a tendency to get hostile with customers who complain. Marching into
the dining room in one scene, she confronts a man who sent back his
steak to be properly cooked. After a hostile verbal exchange, she
jams a knife into the table.</LD>
<TE>   In "8 Mile," Eminem stars in a semiautobiographical tale of a
young Detroit rapper whose anger fuels his music.</TE>
<TE>   HBO's Tony Soprano is prone to outbursts and was working on
impulse control with help from a psychiatrist. A commercial for Glad
trash bags features a coach going ballistic over a hard-to-wrangle
trash bag.</TE>
<TE>   One common characteristic of these outbursts is that the displays
of temper tend to be wildly out of proportion to the offense. Should
being called a name provoke someone to smash glass? The characters
have too much invested in what is in play. Instead of dealing with
anger as a natural part of human existence, they have bottled it up
or held onto it for too long. The emotions come rocketing to the
surface in volcanic explosions, and audiences everywhere enjoy the
vicarious thrill, as long as the character "going postal" isn't
appearing in real time on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Savage or funny, today's tantrum-prone characters are a reflection
of an angry society. One need only review the day's headlines to see
evidence of a mad, mad, mad, mad world.</TE>
<TE>   Anger sells.</TE>
<TE>   Anger is sanctified and applauded.</TE>
<TE>   The trickier question is: Why?</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the day-to-day challenges of living in an urbanized,
hyper-speed, consumer-driven, road-raging, celebrity-obsessed
society, we are all lately suffering from the sadness occasioned by
current events and the attendant feelings of fear, impotence and
anger.</TE>
<TE>   "Something that we talk about in psychiatry a lot is mad versus
sad," says Heidi McCloskey, director of the program for professionals
at the Institute of Living in Hartford, Conn. "Sometimes when an
individual is very sad, it's easier for them to express their anger
because they feel quite threatened by their sadness.... Maybe people
are struggling with a need to feel empowered so they hold up their
anger like a shield."</TE>
<TE>   The characters on big and small screens have as many reasons for
being angry as the names of shooters and terrorists who surface in
news reports.</TE>
<TE>   Where is the contented person? He can sometimes be seen on Turner
Classic Movies.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the anger rages on in a culture that is coming to be
defined by it.</TE>
<TE>   In the fairy tale "Punch-Drunk Love," Barry is saved by love. His
anger abates.</TE>
<TE>   The title character in the happily-ever-after "Mostly Martha" is
likewise rescued by amore in the form of a patient sous-chef.</TE>
<TE>   But the other characters, who have the misfortune to be in stories
that aren't fairy tales, must deal with the raw human impulse toward
anger and rage.</TE>
<TE>   Just like the rest of us.</TE>

<HD>When the networks tried to smother controversy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A new documentary on the Smothers Brothers recalls just how
lock-jawed much of television was years in advance of today's wildly
careening speedway of instantaneous blather.</LD>
<LD>   The Who Brothers?</LD>
<LD>   A brief history: More than three decades before late-nighter Bill
Maher was zinged for his hot-button comments about Sept. 11
terrorists on ABC, and long before the U.S. was wired for cable,
folk-singing comedians Tommy and Dick Smothers were in weekly
prime-time combat with censors at CBS.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of Thanksgiving, much is owed the Smotherses for their
fight last century on behalf of popping off in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   As Maureen Muldaur notes in "Smothered," her film Wednesday on
cable's Bravo channel, these guys were hardly anarchists Sacco and
Vanzetti. Nor were they itching to tell dirty jokes, shout
obscenities, parade nude across the screen and flash for the camera.</TE>
<TE>   At issue instead was social comment and satire in "The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour" ranging from biting anti-Vietnam War digs to
David Steinberg's wittily irreverent sermonettes about God and
Scripture that were benign by today's standards (think "South Park").
The Smothers' story is always relevant, but especially now when war
looms with Iraq. The stakes and environment are much different, of
course. But would scripts voicing skepticism about that possible war
meet resistance like that encountered over Vietnam by the Smotherses?
Surely not, one would hope.</TE>
<TE>   The squelching of "objectionable" material in the 1960s did not
occur in a vacuum. TV's own scripture had been censorship in its
infancy, which many now recall generously as the medium's golden age.
Instead it was largely television's Golden Age of Blahs, a time when
sponsors dictated much of program content, and blacklisted topics and
talent were unreasonably excluded from the airwaves in deference to
the nation's whipped-up Cold War frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing for a network to responsibly oversee what it beams
to the public, another for it to suppress legitimate speech for
questionable reasons.</TE>
<TE>   And extending that tradition of keeping TV pastel is the blipping
of opinion that "Smothered" reprises with ample clips from the late
1960s, along with comments by the brothers themselves, their show's
writers and performers and CBS programmers of that era.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to get through as much as we could," says Tommy.</TE>
<TE>   His few years on this hot-seat with his brother overlapped the
Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon presidencies, and also the
Vietnam conflict their show sought relentlessly to protest under an
umbrella of entertainment. As it turned out, though, "The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour" would be canceled before the war was.</TE>
<TE>   This was not a pretty time for television in general.</TE>
<TE>   How paradoxical that a medium so energized by advances in
technology was guided at the very top mainly by executives who shrank
regressively from using public airwaves to present ideas that rippled
the waters even slightly.</TE>
<TE>   And how quaint this all seems today when prime time welcomes just
about anything raunchy short of bestiality, when cable's all-news
channels give knee-jerk live access to one talking head case after
another, when public figures and their policies are drilled
repeatedly in the monologues of Leno, Letterman and others.</TE>
<TE>   Is some of it witless, even repulsive? Yes. Better that, however,
than more gutlessness and repression.</TE>
<TE>   With cable as a major player, the industry today views its
audience as not one faceless mass, as it did in the 1960s, but as
splintered into individual groups whose interests are shaped by age
and background. One result is more diversity in programming.</TE>
<TE>   Restraints are still in place, naturally, and even moderate
insurgency often unable to elude blue pencils and fight through the
blubber of TV's programming bureaucracy. Yet the contrast between
eras is striking.</TE>
<TE>   In tumultuous 1968, when Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. were murdered, and U.S. boasts of triumph in Vietnam
were contradicted by the Tet offensive, CBS was trying to keep a lid
on an hour of TV with the contours of a mainstream variety show. It
had big production numbers. It had resident dancers and singers. It
had Nelson Riddle and his orchestra. It had establishment guests like
Kate Smith and Jimmy Durante.</TE>
<TE>   But guests, also, whose controversial politics must have made CBS
big shots shudder.</TE>
<TE>   CBS allowed Joan Baez to dedicate a song to her husband, David
Harris, for example, but edited out her explanation that he was being
imprisoned for resisting the draft.</TE>
<TE>   It vetoed folk singer Pete Seeger's appearance to sing his
anti-war song, "Waist Deep in the Big Muddy," moreover, with only an
ensuing public outcry causing the network to relent and let him sing
it on the show later that season.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Smothers Brothers were their decade's boldest TV
renegades, their show was not the medium's only comedy venue for
political material in the 1960s. Arriving on NBC several years
earlier, and patterned after a British series, was a tepid prime-time
news satire titled "That Was the Week That Was." And later that
decade came NBC's hit "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in" and the Fickle
Finger of Fate it wagged at assorted targets.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, Dan Rowan once noted, was that his show used
politics to launch comedy, the Smotherses used comedy to launch
politics, as in stony Pat Paulsen's editorials. "And what are the
arguments against the draft?" he began one of them. "We hear it is
unfair, immoral, discourages young men from studying, ruins their
careers and their lives." Pause. "Picky, picky, picky."</TE>
<TE>   The program even launched Paulsen as a mock presidential
candidate, and at one point used a split screen to depict him
speaking out of both sides of his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   As for Steinberg, here he is in Muldaur's film speaking about
Moses famously getting an earful from the Burning Bush: " 'Moses,
take off your shoes from off of your feet,' God said in his redundant
way." When Moses obeyed and then approached the bush, Steinberg
added, "he burned his feet."</TE>
<TE>   When protests streamed in, CBS forbade the Smotherses from airing
more of Steinberg's religious material. But in fact, a subsequent
taping of a Steinberg sermonette spoofing Jonah and the New Testament
("And to this day the New Testament doesn't sell ... ") would be the
whale that broke the camel's back. Even though it didn't air, it
contributed mightily to CBS closing down "The Smothers Brothers
Comedy Hour" in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, the show's once-solid ratings had sagged, and Tommy,
who was hardly the dolt he played on camera, had become so obsessed
with telling viewers about his problems with CBS that he had ceased
being funny.</TE>
<TE>   The Smotherses won a breach of contract suit against CBS, and had
several more shots on TV, none close to being as momentous as their
original comedy-variety hour on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Which was succeeded in its Sunday night time slot by "Hee Haw."</TE>

<HD>'UpClose' gets personal</HD>
<DH>With nothing to lose, the late-night news show, scheduled
to end on Jan. 24, draws out elusive guests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Doonesbury" creator Garry Trudeau hasn't done an extended television
interview in 30 years, but next week, ABC's late-night news program
"UpClose" draws him out of his self-imposed media shell for two
nights.</LD>
<LD>   "UpClose" approached him out of "sheer orneriness," jokes Ted
Koppel, anchor of "Nightline," from which "UpClose" was spun off. "If
he had avoided interviews for so long, we figured he must have
something to hide." For his part, Trudeau says he accepted this time,
somewhat to his own surprise, because working late at night, he had
stumbled on the show and become a fan.</LD>
<LD>   The program airs at 12:05 a.m. in New York, where Trudeau lives,
and on KABC, and even later in some other cities.</LD>
<TE>   "The conversations seemed so intimate and relaxed, there was
almost a coffeehouse feel," Trudeau says. "Everything seemed designed
to allow the guest to tell his story with a minimum of static and
interruption." Unlike much of television, he says, "there was no
pressure to talk in sound bites, no guests and hosts matching wits,
no one selling anything."</TE>
<TE>   It's a second major "get" for the interview show -- which also
landed the press-shy David Letterman for its first broadcast in July
-- but it may end up being one of its last. "UpClose" is scheduled to
end on Jan. 24, having been created as filler for the 7 1/2 months
between the demise of Bill Maher's "Politically Incorrect" and the
launch of "The Jimmy Kimmel Show."</TE>
<TE>   The program is an oddity in the slick world of network television
news. It has few celebrity guests, low-key conversations that
meander, no major news-making headlines that emerge. The look is
minimal, with just the interviewer -- Koppel or one of the
"Nightline" correspondents -- and subject, over a small table, with a
bland background.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors go against the grain but have worked to draw out
some guests like Trudeau, who often shun the medium or have been
shunned by it because they don't talk fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   Koppel originally pushed executive producer Tom Bettag to give the
profiles a glossier feel, with more outside-the-studio pictures and
commentary from people other than the guest.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was being a little too bare bones.... I didn't have
enough confidence in the basic interesting-ness of just sitting down
and talking to interesting people," Koppel says.</TE>
<TE>   "Television producers are in love with all the pictures and all of
our whiz-bang," Bettag says. "But we found that the power of the
conversation, when two people really hit it off, is more powerful
than we thought."</TE>
<TE>   The cameras are far back but a telephoto lens gives a sense of
"just the two of us," Bettag says.</TE>
<TE>   Even guests who aren't comfortable with television, such as
Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles Moose, who oversaw the
recent Washington, D.C.-area sniper investigation, open up.</TE>
<TE>   The show, freed from the need to spike its ratings because it will
be gone soon, has profiled some lesser-known people, such as surgeon
Ben Carson and blind mountain climber Erik Weihenmayer. About 2.3
million viewers have tuned in on average this season, or about just
under half of what NBC's "Tonight" show with Jay Leno draws to win
the midnight half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal for "UpClose" had been on the table for months before
ABC and parent Walt Disney Co. tried to kill off "Nightline" to make
room for David Letterman, who ultimately stayed at CBS. That episode
opened the way, ironically, for "UpClose," which Disney chose to fill
the gap before Kimmel could get his show going.</TE>
<TE>   Although "UpClose" is slated to end in two months, Bettag says the
staff "would kill to do it on any venue that would have it," and
there is some hope that a new home might be found. "The conversations
are just starting now," Bettag says.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, for Koppel, the program's limited run has been
freeing: "There's a wonderful no-lose quality about doing this
broadcast." Koppel revels in talking with guests for longer than he
can on "Nightline," which is usually done live or taped as if it were
live.</TE>
<TE>   With live interviews, Koppel says, "you can't afford to be
patient; there's not enough time to listen to people at length.
People who like to take three, four, five minutes to tell a story
have very little place on live television."</TE>
<TE>   Both programs are a half-hour, but "UpClose" interviews often run
longer and are edited, or they air over two nights, as Trudeau's
will, on Tuesday and Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I love being able to listen to people without having to
interrupt," says Koppel, who has been accused at times of being
abrupt with guests. "I always feel a little awkward doing that,
especially with those not accustomed to being on television, who
can't understand why they're not allowed to finish a thought that's
going on too long."</TE>

<HD>City recalls Hendrix, but without official memorial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gene Johnson</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Sixty years after his birth, one of the most important artists ever
to emerge from Seattle is -- at least officially -- almost invisible
here.</LD>
<LD>   There's no Jimi Hendrix Boulevard, no Hendrix Arena, no Hendrix
Elementary School.</LD>
<LD>   The only thing the city has done to recognize the man many
consider the world's greatest guitar player is to give him a rock --
at the Woodland Park Zoo.</LD>
<TE>   Biographer Charles Cross of Seattle, who has spent years
researching Hendrix for an upcoming book, called the oversight
"almost criminal."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen first envisioned his $240-million
Experience Music Project here as a temple to Hendrix, who remains the
rock museum's focus. On Sunday, the facility threw him a 60th
birthday party.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Corr, a spokesman for Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels, said the
lack of a memorial is not because of the city's unwillingness; it
simply hasn't been an issue.</TE>
<TE>   But for years, city officials refused to name anything after him
because of his drug use.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrix enjoyed living in Seattle and planned to return to live on
Mercer Island, said his half-sister, Janie Hendrix.</TE>
<TE>   As for the zoo memorial, she said: "Would we have done that?
Probably not, but at the time that they did it, there was nothing in
the city that recognized Jimi."</TE>
<TE>   She added, "We'd love to have a street named for him."</TE>

<HD>Mondrian's back story, powerfully told</HD>
<DH>A Fort Worth show follows the artist's work in landscapes,
before he would move on to pure abstractions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>Usually, the long career of the Dutch Modernist painter Piet Mondrian
(1872-1944) is split into two parts, with a pivotal interlude in
between. Most significant are the great, classic geometric
abstractions, in which blocks of primary colors are interspersed with
white and divided by black lines -- paintings that do not mimic in
any way the visible world outside the canvas. Then, there's
everything that came before -- landscapes, still-lifes, urban views
and figures, as well as abstractions in which the visible world can
still be discerned.</LD>
<LD>   The pivot between the two Mondrians is World War I. Mondrian
entered art school in Amsterdam in 1892, and 20 years later his slow,
methodical progress as a painter led him to Paris, capital city of
the avant-garde. But the chaotic eruption of the Great War sent him
back to the Netherlands, where isolation in the studio allowed him to
rethink his entire artistic enterprise. The war's unprecedented,
unspeakable destruction was followed by a determination to build art
anew.</LD>
<TE>   At the Kimbell Art Museum, a large and engaging exhibition of
Mondrian's paintings and drawings is focused exclusively on early
developments leading up to that pivotal interlude of the war.
Organized by the Gemeentemuseum in the Hague, the Musee d'Orsay in
Paris and the Kimbell -- where it makes its only American appearance,
through Dec. 8 -- the show wants to erase the common idea of two
Mondrians. It's only partly successful.</TE>
<TE>   More pointedly, it is meant as a gentle, if firm, rebuke to the
magnificent 1994 retrospective principally organized by New York's
Museum of Modern Art. That show was frankly polemical and, to my
mind, utterly convincing. It asserted that late Mondrian is great
Mondrian. Its largest group of pictures came from the last dozen
years of the painter's life, when he began to transform the
classically harmonious format of his abstract grid paintings by
injecting them with a dynamic rhythm. Mondrian's first 30 years were
given a relatively light once-over.</TE>
<TE>   The current show wants to redress its perception of an imbalance.
The early work is the sole subject this time out. Mondrian after the
war might look different from Mondrian before the war, the curators
assert, but his artistic motive did not change.</TE>
<TE>   The 110 paintings and drawings assembled in "Mondrian, 1892-1914:
The Path to Abstraction" do offer a clear case for continuity in the
artist's aspirations for his work. Even in the earliest landscapes,
Mondrian emphasizes the tactile, material qualities of paint as a
means to articulate ephemeral space and light. The meandering path of
a country road leading to a forest's edge is carved in tan and white
pigment. A web of tree branches serves to delineate the surface plane
of a picture, making it a screen on which the world is projected and
through which it is sensed.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, and with ever greater confidence and subtlety, the
historic opposition between line and color as art's authentic
conveyor of truth gets erased. Mondrian begins to use a heavily
loaded brush. Emphasizing the painted mark splits the difference:
Line becomes color, color is indistinguishable from line.</TE>
<TE>   Mondrian also splits the difference in other surprising ways.
Dozens of his landscapes focus on riverbanks, where earth and water,
rooted stability and constant fluidity, coincide. Dusk emerges as a
favored time of day -- those mysterious, in-between moments between
daylight and darkness, when clarity of form gives way to ethereal
atmosphere. At dusk, abstract form replaces the explicitness of
objects.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout these early years, Mondrian paints with obvious
sureness. He also repeats motifs incessantly. There's a highly
nuanced sense of wanting to get it right and of knowing the big
impact that even the smallest compositional shift can make.</TE>
<TE>   His approach speaks of the larger Symbolist ethos common to so
much art of the day, in which nature harbors a spiritual dimension
that transcends appearances. Coupled with his growing interest in
theosophy, with its faith in the power of mystical insight,
Mondrian's landscape paintings radiate presence.</TE>
<TE>   But they remain fundamentally conservative. Not until he was 35
did he begin to embrace progressive Modern art -- from the chromatic
experiments of Kees van Dongen to the visual fireworks of Van Gogh.
(The crimson "Mill in Sunlight" of 1908 makes you squint.)</TE>
<TE>   When he did, his work began to metamorphose. The Kimbell show lays
out Mondrian's encounters with Cezanne and then Cubism in a
thoroughly bracing display.</TE>
<TE>   Even here, though, in what would appear to be extreme variations
on abstract form -- Cubist grids interrupted by occasional arcs, a
muted palette of grays, pinks and ochre -- Mondrian never leaves
landscape completely behind. The show points out how the lines of the
grid remain a visual figure floated on a colored ground. Cool
tonalities at the bottom of the picture typically lighten toward the
top, much the way earth transitions to sky.</TE>
<TE>   The show stops here, just before the pivot of the war years. And,
yes, it has made its point about continuity in the artist's
aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's no getting by the fact that Mondrian after the war
does look different from Mondrian before the war -- and that
difference is critical. The Kimbell exhibition shows Mondrian going
through a long process of abstracting from nature. What happened next
was a struggle to abandon even the slightest hint of mimicry while
maintaining nature's truth.</TE>
<TE>   Call it a search for ways to abstract toward nature. The Kimbell
show fills in a lot of the powerfully compelling back story, but
Mondrian's greatness lies in how he made painting an independent
proxy for nature. The MOMA show got it exactly right: An artist's
intent is finally less important than an artwork's effect.</TE>

<DH>Michael Crichton's macabre vision finds another perch in
'Prey.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettijane Levine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Crichton turns out to be as oddly compelling in person as his
weird creatures are on paper. Crichton's the father of the
techno-thriller, the guy who dreamed up cloned dinos roaming
"Jurassic Park" and more than a dozen other bestselling books of
futuristic fiction loosely based on scientific facts. Now he's come
up with "Prey," yet another tale of technology gone amok, featuring a
monster you wouldn't want to reckon with.</LD>
<LD>   This one is actually a swarm of nano-particles -- each less than
half the thickness of a human hair -- teensy machines with cameras
built in. They have the ability to reproduce and evolve independent
of the humans who created them. This means they are quite literally
alive -- and they can become very, very evil.</LD>
<LD>   There are scientists who say such a swarm might be created to act
as an undetectable and indestructible military spying machine. In
Crichton's imagination, they can be programmed to search you out,
inhabit your brain and turn your flesh into oozing white froth before
they further alter your physical being to suit their needs. You
should be very afraid.</LD>
<TE>   As with all of Crichton's tales, the technology he writes about is
already available; he's just taken it to a level that we can only
hope will remain fictional.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, writing isn't enough these days. An author has to get
out and pitch his product -- an obstacle even Crichton, 60, can't
wiggle around. He arrives for an interview at a hotel near his Santa
Monica home looking glum. He is in the midst of a messy divorce from
his fourth wife, the mother of his only child. He has just filed suit
against her and her lawyer, for allegedly violating terms of the
confidential divorce agreement when the attorney discussed it on a TV
show. In September, Crichton and his 12-year-old daughter were at
home when armed robbers bound and gagged them and ransacked the
house. He understandably refuses to discuss any of the above or
anything else of a personal nature.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he seems reluctant at first to discuss anything at all.
Asked about the unsympathetic picture he draws of his new book's
female lead character -- an irritable workaholic scientist-mom who
slaps her baby for kicking during a diaper-change -- Crichton simply
replies, "You're not meant to like her."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the book's hero -- a tender, nurturing house-husband
who minds the kids, cooks the meals and shops at Crate &amp; Barrel -- he
responds: "Don't you think in the real world that there are very
high-powered women who have a demanding business life and tend to
find nurturing men to couple with?"</TE>
<TE>   Crichton is 6 feet, 9 inches tall and very slender, which gives
him the pleasant appearance of an exotic, long-legged bird. And which
also means he views the world a bit differently than most people:
from an elevated position. Add to that his lofty intellect -- he
graduated from Harvard and from Harvard Medical School and did
post-doctoral study at the Salk Institute in La Jolla -- and you have
someone who is worlds apart from the hordes who scarf down popcorn as
they watch the films made from his books. ("Prey," too, is slated to
become a movie.)</TE>
<TE>   He is also richer than most people, according to Forbes magazine,
which named him the seventh-wealthiest man in the entertainment
industry. Crichton has, at various times in his career, written and
directed films, run software companies and created successful
computer games. He has just signed a contract with Sega, which he
also refuses to discuss. He has written four nonfiction books,
including a definitive volume on the artist Jasper Johns. Oh, and he
created the genre-bending TV show "ER," which started the whole trend
to quick-cut, fast-talk docudramas.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare moment of what passes for candor, he says he likes to
spend time with people who don't do what he does. "I would rather be
with people who are having their experiences rather than shaping
them" for others to consume.</TE>
<TE>   Crichton speaks slowly, with pauses, as if cautiously doling out
words. Then, as fast as you can say nano-swarm -- and for no apparent
reason -- he decides to open up. Suddenly, even the briefest question
evokes an answer many minutes long. He offers up meandering,
pedagogical monologues that at first seem to have no purpose but, on
reflection, turn out to be prophesies every bit as riveting as his
techno-tales. Entire histories of literature, feminism and other
issues pour forth.</TE>
<TE>   The human condition</TE>
<TE>   Question: Would you ever write a book just about human
relationships, without technology as a factor?</TE>
<TE>   A small part of Crichton's answer: "Probably not. I'm not sure I
would have anything to add to what already exists. I mean, the
enormous amount of fiction that I read is about all this
interpersonal stuff, which seems to me to have been better done by
George Eliot or Jane Austen. I view the arts, broadly speaking, in
exactly the same way that I do science or technology. I view them as
advancing and moving forward, in directions where they undergo
transformations that have to do with the larger society around them.</TE>
<TE>   "A simple example is that with the arrival of photography in the
1860s, there was a certain archival or recording quality of painting
that vanished. You no longer needed to paint a picture of a battle to
preserve the scene. And so artists were obliged to move to something
else because that need was taken away.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 19th century there's a tremendous narrative focus on the
experience of the individual caught in the larger forces of society.
How people perceived the choices that they had or didn't have as a
result of the society. And 20th century serious fiction has largely
explored a sort of inner psychological landscape, has moved
increasingly in the direction of what was going on somehow inside
your head. Those two things have been thoroughly done. So I don't
know what else there is to do. Possibly nothing. And I'm serious.
There may be nothing left."</TE>
<TE>   Wait, he's not through yet. He goes on to explain what he sees as
the Freudian fraud that propelled most 20th century literature.
"There is no id, ego, superego. It's not there. There is no brain
part. And no repressed memory. None of it. It was all a lie, a
fabulous fantasy. But one so persuasive, so seductive, that it
informed the intellectual life of much of the last hundred years." As
Freudian theory becomes obsolete, he continues, and Freud's stature
erodes, "then this style of writing seems outdated as well."</TE>
<TE>   He foresees an end to it. The coming-of-age novel, the
relationship novel, the Woody Allen-esque tale of inner turmoil, all
gone with Freud's wind. What comes next? If he has a clue, he isn't
saying.</TE>
<TE>   The relaxed, talkative version of Crichton is improbably charming,
witty, even humble. He is not considered one of the world's great
writers. In fact, he's been consistently chastened by critics for
formulaic plots with little character definition. But he's the
prisoner of his muse, he says. "The projects arrive in my head, bang
on the door and I have to answer. So if I write something similar to
something else I wrote, I'm kind of helpless to do anything about
it."</TE>
<TE>   Reviews are mixed for "Prey" (HarperCollins), seeming to depend
upon the intellectual stretch of the reviewer. USA Today calls it
"too technical, a big fat tech manual wrapped around a threadbare
story."</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times reviewer says it is "irresistibly suspenseful";
he "turned the pages feverishly" and terms it "Crichton's most
ambitious techno-thriller yet."</TE>
<TE>   The divergent critics' views confirm yet another of the author's
theories, that "we are not all living in the same world. We see that
now because of what's going on between the West and Middle East, in
terms of cultural clashes. But even in L.A., people inhabit very
different worlds -- and it can be very startling to get a glimpse of
someone's else's."</TE>
<TE>   Crichton seems pretty much alone in the world he inhabits. To true
scientists, his work is pure fluff and not cutting-edge enough. The
nano-technology he writes about in "Prey," for example, is old news
to them. But nonscientists often see his work as too far out and
scientific.</TE>
<TE>   He refers to himself as being like a bat. "When a bat is with
mammals, they all say, 'Go away. You're a bird. You have wings.' When
a bat is with birds they say, 'Go away. You're a mammal. You have
fur.' So the bat never fits in anywhere."</TE>

<LD>I was about to write an intelligent column regarding war, peace,
disease, police brutality and the impact of Viagra on the Republican
Party when it occurred to me that it would run the day after
Thanksgiving, and that writing anything intelligent for you would be
lost. I picture you sprawled on the couch, your feet in the air,
stuffed to the earlobes with dead bird, and I'm not going to waste
good words on your bloated brain. So how's your dog?</LD>
<LD>   The reason I ask is that my wife, the innovative Cinelli, is
determined that Barkley is going to learn to take long trips with us.
I say if she's talking about taking the dog on vacations, I don't go.
She says fine. I say fine with me too, and when the credit-card bill
comes, ask the dog if he can pay it. She says fine, I'll open an
account for him. I say fine. She says fine.</LD>
<LD>   The reason this whole debate began is that we have a book in the
house by Eileen Barish concerning traveling with your dog. It's
called "Vacationing With Your Pet." The book is full of tips and
lively ways of having fun with your dog while trying to get away from
it all, plus places to stay that will tolerate your pet without
having to sneak him past the night clerk in a picnic basket or a
suitcase.</LD>
<TE>   Barish is no doubt a cheerful, upbeat lady whose dogs are calm,
well-mannered animals that do not try to leap into the driver's seat
and take over at 60 miles an hour or attempt to leap out a window
somewhere between here and Buttonwillow in pursuit of a passing bird.
I say God bless and keep those kinds of pets, and why have I never
had one?</TE>
<TE>   You probably read our story the other day that quoted scientists
as saying dog behavior has changed in about the past 10,000 years of
their domesticity to more closely match the needs of humans. That's
simplifying months of agonizing study, but that's what I do for a
living, I simplify.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley, a springer spaniel, who may understand our needs, chooses
to ignore them. He believes in doing whatever suits him at the
moment. Fine. But that's why I will never take a vacation with him.</TE>
<TE>   Cinelli has forgotten the misadventures with our cursed dog Hoover
during a cross-country trip in a rented camper. Three times he broke
free and went dashing away with both of us in pursuit, screaming his
name, fearful that he would disappear into the crowds and never be
seen again.</TE>
<TE>   Now that I think back on it, the idea has some appeal, but Cinelli
loved that stupid dog and would have spent her life looking for him.</TE>
<TE>   "You remember all that?" I said to her. "The wild chases in our
underwear, the screaming, the people who watched and thought we were
crazy?"</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't in my underwear. It was a nightgown. He just
misunderstood the rules."</TE>
<TE>   "He understood and so does Barkley, and I'm not traveling with a
dog!"</TE>
<TE>   "Fine. We'll go alone."</TE>
<TE>   "Fine."</TE>
<TE>   I know that, really, she won't. Every time she's had to take the
dog to get his hair cut, she has come home at wit's end. He pulls her
arm off trying to get into the car. He pulls her arm off trying to
get out of the car. He wants to jump out and run alongside the car.
He insists on driving.</TE>
<TE>   Those things do not seem to matter. She is ready to crate the dog,
or whatever, fly him to Paris and take us with him to some of the
world's best restaurants to dine on fine meats and expensive
champagnes. This is an animal who once stole three-dozen coconut
cookies off the kitchen counter and ran off with a frozen turkey in
his teeth. He's just not ready for lightly sauteed poitrine de veau
with a delicate mushroom sauce.</TE>
<TE>   I will grant you that in Paris they sometimes do bring their dogs
to restaurants, which is among many things I don't understand about
the French. The last time we were there, a woman brought in her
Pomeranian pup, sat him between us on a row of seats and allowed him
to stare while I ate. The long, hard look of a hungry dog following
each bite is bad enough, but Barkley wouldn't just stare, he'd take
action. I hesitate to consider the consequences of trying to explain
his food thievery to the French in English, sacre bleu.</TE>
<TE>   I would like to thank Eileen Barish for writing the book and for
including the dog's prayer and that perfectly darling illustration of
a doggie's little paws in supplication and the "Ode to Dogs," but
traveling with Barkley just isn't for me. If he were like Steinbeck's
Charley, that would be different. But he's not, and I'm not going
with him on a trip. Fine. Fine.</TE>

<HD>Politically incorrect fashion term</HD>
<DH>Legitimizing the use of 'wife beater' to describe a type of
undershirt worn by the hip has struck a nerve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a word or phrase that's been floating around in the culture
finally lands in the Oxford English Dictionary, it has transcended
the zeitgeist. Homer Simpson's exasperated "d'oh" made the cut last
year. So did "retail therapy" and "boy band."</LD>
<LD>   According to Jesse Sheidlower, North American editor of the
dictionary, an unusual definition of the phrase "wife beater" is now
a contender for lexicographic immortality.</LD>
<LD>   The phrase no longer would strictly refer to a man who beats his
wife; its definition would be expanded to mean a white ribbed-cotton
sleeveless undershirt that is a wardrobe basic these days for movie
costumers, rap stars and models.</LD>
<TE>   In the popular imagination, the shirts are associated with the
Stanley Kowalskis and Tony Sopranos of the world: anti-elitist,
testosterone-dripping lugs who sit in front of the tube in their
underwear and slap their wives around, hence (presumably) the
slangy-sounding name.</TE>
<TE>   Although the style has been around for more than a century, in
recent years there's been a boom. The shirts have shown up on bad
boys Tommy Lee, Kid Rock and Snoop Dogg and on femme fashion plates
Madonna, Britney Spears and Gwyneth Paltrow. Calvin Klein makes them.
Even Chanel and Dolce &amp; Gabbana have offered versions of the
scoop-neck tops.</TE>
<TE>   The desire to look trashy isn't hard to explain (they're sexy on
the right body and showcase well-toned biceps). What's mysterious is
how such a potentially offensive phrase managed to slip into the
fashion lexicon so easily.</TE>
<TE>   Mark-Evan Blackman, chairman of the menswear design department at
New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, remembers hearing "wife
beater" used when he was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1970s. It
referred to the shirts worn by "pumped-up Italian guys in pizzerias,"
said Blackman. "The stoves were 150 degrees, these guys were lifting
weights and they had a virile appeal."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reference to class," said Valerie Steele, curator of the
museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who had not heard the
term "wife beater" until a few years ago. "The subtext is that
Stanley Kowalski and other working-class men are more sexy and
physical, which may be why everyone wears them at the gym."</TE>
<TE>   The undershirts are often referred to in music and film. Rapper
Eve sings about how good she looks in her "wife beater with a bangin'
tan." And in the final scene of "8 Mile," Eminem mocks rival rapper
Papa Doc for wearing one of the shirts, calling him "Snoop Dogg in a
bra."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wears them, especially hip-hop artists," said Susan
Bauer, director of fashion programming at MTV. "But I was told by an
executive not to use the word in the workplace," she said. "So we
just take off the 'wife' and call them 'beaters.' "</TE>
<TE>   The term may have resurfaced as part of an urban aesthetic that
has swept popular culture in the last 15 years, suggests Blackman.
"At one time, people aspired to be wealthy and to get out of the
city. But now people feel to be cool you have to be down with it. I
have wealthy students who say such and such is 'ghetto' or 'pimp,'
and I've heard 'wife beater' at Princeton and Brown. For the people
using these terms, they're not socioeconomic, they're descriptive.
Because regardless of whether you are black or white, live in the
city or the suburbs, everyone today grows up listening to rap."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the appeal of the term "wife beater" may be its sheer
political incorrectness. James Doolin of Dallas found himself in the
middle of a media firestorm after launching a Web site that sells the
shirts, embroidered with script that spells out "wife beater."</TE>
<TE>   Launched in 2000, the site (www.wife-beaters.com) features a "Wife
Beater Hall of Fame," with photos of Ike Turner, John Wayne Bobbitt,
Mike Tyson and others, and it offers a discount to customers who can
prove a domestic violence conviction. The discount, says Doolin, is a
joke, but he defends his business concept, saying that the term "wife
beater" has transcended its literal meaning to become a symbol for
all rebellious, antisocial behavior. "It goes with the MTV 'Jackass'
mentality," he said. "It's about a juvenile sense of humor that
appeals to people in their teens and 20s."</TE>
<TE>   But not everybody is laughing. Karin Willison, a 25-year-old
graduate student studying psychology at Antioch University in L.A.,
launched a counter Web site (www.outspokenclothing.com) that sells
T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan "wife beater beater" and an
illustration of a woman punching a man. "It's intended to be
humorous," she said. "I don't advocate violence either way, but if
people are buying shirts that say 'wife beater,' women are going to
fight back."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, says
that calling a shirt a "wife beater" trivializes domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The implication is that wife beating is not viewed as
sufficiently serious to lift it above the level of something that's
OK to joke about."</TE>
<TE>   Warren Farrell, the San Diego-based men's advocate and author of
"Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say," finds the term offensive to
men as well as women. "We are so conscious of things like wife
beating, but we are not conscious at all about husband beating.
Domestic violence is equal opportunity. I wouldn't feel good about
people wearing 'husband beaters' either."</TE>
<TE>   The OED's Sheidlower, who says "wife beater" probably will turn up
soon in the dictionary's online edition (www.oed.com), says any fuss
over the phrase is media-made. "Apart from fashion writers writing
about this, there's no evidence that this term is being used in an
offensive way.... People who use this word are not using it to put
anyone down."</TE>

<LD>"We will now discuss the Struggle for Existence." The quote -- one of
nearly two dozen that appear in Elaine Reichek's recent body of work
at Shoshana Wayne Gallery -- comes from Charles Darwin and might well
serve as an epigraph for the exhibition as a whole.</LD>
<LD>   Reichek's concern in this work is the concept of creation -- the
crux of that perpetual struggle to which Darwin refers -- as it is
viewed in Western thought. Her approach to the issue is scholarly:
She's scoured the canons of Christianity, art history, science and
science fiction -- four fields with a vested interest in the subject
-- then re-inscribed relevant fragments of image and text into her
work wholesale, as one might copy them into a notebook or personal
journal.</LD>
<LD>   The medium through which she performs this re-inscription,
however, is not typically associated with scholarship: embroidery.
Her principal format is the sampler, a mode of needlework that was
traditionally used as a teaching tool for young women. Her adoption
of the form isn't ironic or glib, but respectfully in keeping with
the sampler's original educational purpose. Instead of learning the
alphabet and simple arithmetic, however, Reichek is grappling here
with Genesis, sorting through Milton and Schopenhauer, and
contemplating the role of the artist in the cosmic order.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, she is reclaiming the tradition of the sampler
as a historically valuable body of texts on par with those of art
history and science fiction, quoting extant samplers as she does Paul
Gauguin and Ray Bradbury, and citing their authors appropriately. The
power of the work lies in the intelligence of its many
juxtapositions, such as a lofty statement by artist Robert Smithson
("The nonexistence of things is what the artist takes for 'materials'
") with a verse from Genesis ("And God said, Let there be light: and
there was light"); and an image of Michelangelo's famous fresco, "The
Creation of Adam," with a mournful lament by the monster in Mary
Shelley's "Frankenstein" ("Oh, Frankenstein, remember that I am thy
creature; I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel,
whom thou drivest from joy").</TE>
<TE>   In suggesting connections between these and other seemingly
disparate texts, Reichek draws from each a subtle new dimension. She
has been at the business of embroidery for some time -- longer than
it's been respectable for an artist to embrace a feminine craft --
and she seems here to have reached a state of real synthesis. Despite
an extremely awkward installation (the gallery space is simply too
big for the work), the exhibition takes what began as a politically
astute concept to a level of philosophic inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 2525 Michigan Ave., Santa Monica, (310)
453-7535, through Saturday. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Shedding the layers of identity</TE>
<TE>   Meg Cranston's new exhibition at the Happy Lion in Chinatown
consists of five life-size pinatas fashioned in the artist's own
image. They are realistically shaped, with willowy limbs and
delicate, although expressionless, faces. Each is stylishly dressed
in a different crepe-paper outfit. Hung from the ceiling at various
heights and angles like elements of some sacrificial ritual, they
make for a strangely unnerving installation.</TE>
<TE>   It is a relatively simple body of work in itself, but one that
cleverly aligns several potent strains of symbolism and association.
The history of the pinata, like that of many other now-secular
traditional objects, is rooted in both paganism and Catholicism,
which lends a curious duality of implications: fertility and sin,
celebration and destruction, abundance and aggression.</TE>
<TE>   In giving her pinatas a female form, Cranston also alludes to the
complex relationship between femininity and violence, tapping into
the fear of physical vulnerability on the one hand (it is all too
easy to imagine one of these figures buckling under the blow of a
baseball bat), and culturally ingrained masochism on the other. At
the same time, there is something regenerative about the function of
the pinata.</TE>
<TE>   In issuing replica after replica of herself in different outfits
or costumes, one imagines Cranston shedding extraneous layers of
identity, perhaps in the interest of arriving at some purer state of
self. The title of the series, "Magical Death," would seem to support
such a reading.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking of the five sculptures, hung at the center of
the gallery, is clothed in pink boots and a hood-to-ankle bodysuit of
frayed, multi-colored paper, her hands open in a gesture of
receptivity that is echoed in her upturned face. Cranston looks here
like some sort of shamanic rainbow goddess, suggesting, perhaps, that
the principles of creation and destruction are not so far removed.</TE>

through Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The elegant art of paring down</TE>
<TE>   The images of Swiss photographer Olivier Christinat feel a little
like those stridently spare, slate-and-glass-type living spaces one
often sees featured in highbrow style magazines -- that is to say,
elegant but hard-won. A photograph, like a home, is exceptionally
conducive to clutter.</TE>
<TE>   Minimalism is attainable, one might say, only with great
discipline and considerable wealth: discipline to keep the clutter
out and wealth to ensure that what remains is worthy of its
exclusivity. Christinat certainly has the discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 18 works assembled at the Paul Kopeikin Gallery is a
single concept self-consciously pared down to the fewest possible
elements: the blank wall and floor of a studio, one or two
nondescript props, and a few figures, either nude or clad simply in
dark, solid colors. The tone is dry but refined. As for the wealth --
that is, the conceptual currency necessary to justify such a spare
handling of objects -- it varies. The exhibition -- Christinat's
first in the United States -- draws from three series made over the
last six years. Perhaps the least compelling of these is a suite of
color photographs featuring several attractive, identically posed,
bare-chested women. Although there is something interesting about the
differences that emerge between the women -- despite their
compositional conformity -- one could probably find something just as
interesting about attractive, bare-chested women in any setting.</TE>
<TE>   Considerably more resonant are the black-and-white photographs
from Christinat's "Apocrypha" series. Here, the themes -- all loosely
centered on the Bible's noncanonical texts -- are substantial enough
to fill the ample space opened up by the artist's economy of means.
Although the images included here don't represent the best of the
series, they are quite stirring.</TE>
<TE>   In his most recent series, Christinat reenacts found press
photographs using only a few modestly expressive actors. Though these
images seem considerably less interesting than the originals they're
based on -- they are stripped entirely of context, location and
genuine feeling -- the difference is instructive. It raises
compelling questions regarding the function of gesture and emotional
identification in the mass media.</TE>

label publicity campaigns, playing music that defies categorization
-- part rock, folk and blues.</LD>
<LD>   Harper has won his audience one club at a time, city by city,
traveling by plane, bus and automobile. Fans frequently cite the
musician's music, his message and his accessibility as contributions
to his charm. In his documentary "Pleasure &amp; Pain," playing through
this weekend in Los Angeles, director Danny Clinch takes a look at
Harper's intimate performance style and charismatic persona.</LD>
<LD>   Clinch was a rock music photographer who had first framed the
singer in his lenses for the pages of a music magazine. "There was a
comfort level and a confidence and a communication in the photo
shoot," Harper recalls. "Danny said, 'One day I might want to make a
film on you.' "</LD>
<TE>   The pair laughed and parted, but the idea of a documentary took
hold once Harper's manager and longtime partner, Jay Plunier, saw the
photos from the shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "J.P. had been saying, 'We've got to do a film about you.' So when
he saw the pictures he said, 'This is the guy,' " Harper says. "He
contacted Danny, who said he wanted to make his first feature." The
film had an unconventional production schedule; in fact, Harper says,
"We never had a release date." There were, of course, budgetary
limits but no time constraints. The shooting schedule was negotiated
venue by venue. "We just said, let's start working on it now and when
it's done, it's done." Somewhere between that initial conversation to
the film's premiere last week, Clinch spent more than a year and a
half touring with and filming Harper and his band, the Innocent
Criminals.</TE>
<TE>   The film mimics Harper's genre-blending musical style. Clinch
combined super 8, 16-millimeter and digital video footage to produce
crisp, dramatically lighted onstage shots and grainy video of fans
chatting with Harper in the parking lot after a concert, interspersed
with playful home-movie takes of Harper and bandmates hanging out on
the bus.</TE>
<TE>   And though fans of Harper's music will be more than satisfied with
the film's playlist -- Harper gets considerable time to sing tunes,
including the title song "Pleasure &amp; Pain," in which his relaxed
tenor imbues the lyric with rough-edged blues, soft soul inflections
and the narrative of a folk ballad -- the film does take one
leisurely side trip.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras follow Harper home, and about a quarter of the film is
shot around the performer and his family, at his mother's dining
table and to his grandparent's shop, the Folk Music Center in
Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Here the filmmaking is unobtrusive as Harper's music plays in the
background of conversations with his relatives and recollections from
his past that acknowledge his most powerful influences.</TE>
<TE>   It's there that Harper's roots show most clearly: Each member of
his immediate family is a musician. And Harper reflects, "I'm
super-proud to be from an American musical tradition, but at the same
time I'm very proud to establish my own American tradition, using the
past as part of the foundation and not a crutch."</TE>

<HD>'Chinatown's' Robert Towne to head Scripter Award panel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Towne, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of "Chinatown," will
chair the selection committee for the USC Scripter Award, which
honors the year's best English-language film adaptation of a book or
novella.</LD>
<LD>   Bestowed annually since 1989 by the USC Friends of the Libraries,
the award is billed as the only honor that recognizes both the author
and screenwriter for a film adaptation.</LD>
<LD>   "Adaptations offer unique challenges to the screenwriter, a
delicate and sometimes indelicate balance of interpretive and
creative skills," Towne said. Towne's committee will be made up of
Writers Guild of America members, fiction and nonfiction authors,
film industry executives, USC faculty and members of the Friends of
the USC Libraries.</LD>
<TE>   Panelists will choose five finalists, and ultimately a winner,
from among all English-language films based on books or novellas
written the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's winners were screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and
biographer Sylvia Nasar, honored for their work on "A Beautiful
Mind."</TE>
<TE>   Past chairmen of the committee include screenwriters Steven
Zaillian, Scott Frank and Lawrence Kasdan.</TE>
<TE>   Towne's scripts for "The Last Detail," "Chinatown" and "Shampoo"
were nominated for Oscars in consecutive years. Other screenwriting
credits include "Mission: Impossible," "The Firm," "Love Affair,"
"The Two Jakes" and "Days of Thunder."</TE>
<TE>   He also contributed uncredited scenes to such films as "The
Godfather," "Bonnie and Clyde" and "The Parallax View."</TE>
<TE>   He is writing "Mission: Impossible III" and will direct his
adaptation of John Fante's "Ask the Dust." He has also directed his
scripts for "Personal Best," "Tequila Sunrise" and "Without Limits,"
and has worked as a script doctor on films including "Armageddon" and
"Crimson Tide."</TE>
<TE>   Scripter Award winners will be honored at a March 15 dinner at
USC's Doheny Memorial Library.</TE>

<HD>Bolshoi recaptures its stunning proficiency</HD>
<DH>In an evening of fine performances, Nikolay Tsiskaridze
shows exceptional promise (and some skin).</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a rocky opening night, the Bolshoi Ballet "La Bayadere" settled
into high proficiency on Wednesday at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center. Corps unanimity significantly improved, such
second-ranked paragons as Yan Godovsky and Denis Medvedev inherited
expanded duties, and three new leads danced their roles as if they
were the only cast the Bolshoi would ever need.</LD>
<LD>   In the title role, Galina Stepanenko offered an object lesson in
how to create excitement from dynamic contrasts: floating, delicate
arms and serene balances versus high-velocity turns and the sharpest
pointework imaginable. A very accomplished performance.</LD>
<LD>   As her rival, Maria Alexandrova exuded icy self-assurance,
commanded a spectacular jump and enough technical assurance to whip
through the bravura turning combinations in the Act 2 engagement
scene with disarming lightness. The excellence of Stepanenko and
Alexandrova hardly proved a surprise to anyone familiar with their
dancing from past Bolshoi tours.</LD>
<TE>   However, a young Georgian, Nikolay Tsiskaridze, made his local
debut with the company as the object of their affections, and the
power, flair and daring of his performance marked him as a major
discovery. In his solos, Tsiskaridze pushed himself to the limits of
his technique, with uneven results, but his best moments revealed the
unmistakable charisma of someone who looks and dances like nobody
else on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion note: Besides baring a lot more chest than his
predecessor, Tsiskaridze sported a jeweled, Indian-style nose-ring on
Wednesday and is reportedly the only Bolshoi dancer in the role to be
so adorned on the current tour.</TE>

<HD>President Brady? Wow, Dad, groovy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The polyester-challenged Brady Bunch trade in their split-level home
and move to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in the new Fox movie "The Brady
Bunch in the White House," which premieres tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Cole and Shelley Long, who starred in "The Brady Bunch Movie"
(1995) and "A Very Brady Sequel" (1996), based on the eternally
popular 1969-74 comedy series "The Brady Bunch," return as the
clueless and eternally optimistic Mike and Carol Brady. (The original
"Brady Bunch" can still be seen on TV Land.)</LD>
<LD>   In this outing, son Bobby finds a missing lottery ticket worth $67
million, but instead of keeping the money, Mike decides the "Brady"
thing to do is try to return it to its rightful owner. When no winner
comes forward, the Bradys donate the money to a fund for homeless
architects (Mike's an architect, you'll recall).</LD>
<TE>   The crooked U.S. president invites the Bradys to Washington to
reward their generosity. Because he needs an ethical man on the
ticket, he asks Mike to become his vice presidential running mate.
When the president is forced to resign because of scandal on
inauguration day, Mike becomes president and names Carol vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take long for the White House to begin to look like
their kitschy split-level home. The Bradys allow Marcia to have a
slumber party, and poor Jan begins having conversations with the
painting of Abraham Lincoln while Greg falls in love with an "older
woman."</TE>
<TE>   "It's big and goofy and silly," Cole says of the movie. "It's a
romp."</TE>
<TE>   "The characters don't find what they are doing funny," Long says.
"It is an extreme of earnestness which makes the characters funny.
They have a great deal of respect for everybody they encounter."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Schwartz, the son of "Brady" creator Sherwood Schwartz, was
executive producer and co-writer of the movie with his sister Hope
Juber. Schwartz worked on the original series as a dialogue director
for the six actors portraying the Brady children and later as a
producer and director.</TE>
<TE>   He says there are many reasons why the "Brady Bunch" has become a
popular culture icon. "It was the first family show in color," he
says. "The world hasn't changed a whole bunch since the 1960s. We are
kidded about the clothing, but it wasn't as outlandish as in the
feature films. The moral lessons are pretty much the same. When it
started taking off in syndication, people would say kids were tuning
in for nostalgic purposes, but the fact of the matter is kids don't
understand nostalgia. They turn it on because they like Bobby and
Cindy.</TE>
<TE>   "Another reason why it's so popular is that it's told from the
point of view of the kids, and kids like watching that. Then we
didn't have an extraordinary kid like an Urkle or a Michael J. Fox
character, where it was a fad. So we didn't have catch phrases that
would become dated."</TE>
<TE>   Because the second "Brady" movie didn't repeat the box office
success of the first one, Paramount Pictures decided not to do any
more. Besides, Schwartz says, he and his father had fights with the
studio over the plot for the second movie.</TE>
<TE>   "The first one satirized the Bradys and I thought it was the
proper approach. The second one tried to do the same thing. I thought
the best thing was to apply them to other things pretty much like
Abbott and Costello movies, where you would enter other areas. But
the studios have their own minds, and we couldn't convince them.
Thankfully, it didn't do as well, so we could go back to television,
where we feel very comfortable. Fox got what we wanted to do
immediately."</TE>
<TE>   And though the ultra-square Bradys are blissfully stuck in the
1970s, they actually are not an embarrassment as the first family.
Mike Brady, says Cole, "is clueless, but he does have integrity."</TE>
<TE>   And who can really disagree with Carol Brady's plans to clean up
America's highways or instigating a time-out period between warring
members of Congress?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To see it</TE>
<TE>   "The Brady Bunch in the White House" can be seen Friday at 8 p.m.
on Fox. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young
children).</TE>

<LD>   ***</LD>
<TE>   As long as 2Pac's handlers keep releasing high-caliber music, the
late rapper will remain a hip-hop hero who can compete with anyone on
the market.</TE>
<TE>   On the fifth album (in stores Tuesday) released since his 1996
slaying (a greatest-hits compilation and a collection featuring his
poetry read by musicians and actors have also been released
posthumously), the fiery Tupac Shakur flows with his signature fury
on another 26 tracks, most of which have a fresh sound and feel.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason 2Pac's music can still be effective six years
after his death is that he often raps in generalities, with his
iconic status giving his words weight even when he's not saying
anything profound.</TE>
<TE>   2Pac was championed for his high-profile rivalries with a host of
entertainers as much as for his charged music.</TE>
<TE>   It's telling that his disses to the now-defunct Fugees on "When We
Ride on Our Enemies" have outlived their target.</TE>
<TE>   As has been the case with his other albums, 2Pac's mix of thug
narratives, sexual braggadocio and incendiary messages make this
captivating.</TE>

<HD>An elaborate, goofy spoof of crime-busters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever layers of subtle nuance might lurk within the
post-vaudevillian subtext of the popular "Bullshot Crummond," they
remain as elusive as ever in a goofy, unusually elaborate revival
from Actors Co-op.</LD>
<LD>   This slender spoof of 1940s schlock crime-buster serials was the
brainchild of Britain's aptly named Low Moan Spectacular troupe (Ron
House, Diz White, John Neville-Andrews, Alan Shearman and Derek
Cunningham). Their stiff-upper-lipped shenanigans weather a
transatlantic transplant quite well in director Henry Polic II's
witty, ingenious design concept, which stages the whole piece as a
cinematic melodrama.</LD>
<LD>   Embellished with period pre-feature newsreels, animated snack bar
ads and massive photo backdrops, the piece is performed behind a
scrim that mutes color and filters the action through a slightly
out-of-focus haze. The impressive design efforts of Kathi O'Donohue
(lighting), Shon LeBlanc (costumes), Geoff Green (sound) and
Yakovetic (sets) provide welcome diversion from content that isn't
going to challenge deep thinkers (or even shallow ones, for that
matter).</LD>
<TE>   Although the show's creators still have a lock on definitive
performances, Tim Woodward's turn rescues the problematic one-note
title character with expert slapstick precision married to
matinee-idol good looks (complete with eye shadow and jaunty
mustache). As his leading lady, Amy Landers contributes a requisite
obnoxious laugh all her own -- part vibrato, part air raid siren.</TE>
<TE>   Crummond's Nazi nemesis, the fiendish Otto Von Bruno, forsakes the
traditional shaved head in favor of a Hitler mustache; his
performance usually hits the right notes, but a half-hearted costume
change in a confrontation between two of his characters undercuts one
of the show's best visual gags. Nan McNamara exudes campy, vampy
appeal as his sidekick in evil, Lenya. However, Stephen Van Dorn's
appearances in multiple supporting characters lack the range and
versatility that can take the piece to a more incisive level. The
production looks great and delivers its share of lowbrow antics, but
its safe farcical approach to what is at bottom an overextended skit
lacks the overall surreal weirdness to keep tedious repetition at
bay.</TE>

<LD>Vivid intelligence distinguishes "Winterquest," receiving its world
premiere by the Ziggurat Theatre Ensemble at the Gascon Center
Theatre in Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   Writer-director Stephen Legawiec refashions the myth of Orpheus
and Eurydice into a holiday odyssey of notable refinement.</LD>
<LD>   The setting is the ocean-side village of Bryggen, where
cartographer Orville Scribbet (Dean Purvis) dwells with wife Eurydell
(Jenny Woo). Their idyllic existence is threatened by Orville's
wanderlust, causing his housebound spouse to disappear during a
curtain-shopping excursion.</LD>
<TE>   When Bryggen's seasonal tributary boat fails to appear on
schedule, three commedia-masked artisans (Jill Lawrence, Beverly
Sotelo and Dana Wieluns) enlist the embittered Orville to help them
find it. Their airborne journey shapes a regenerative Christmas
parable, summed up by Eurydell's locket inscription: "The heart's
terrain is vast and unsounded/But love's a torch, clearing wide a
sacred field for miracles."</TE>
<TE>   Legawiec's staging is imaginative, with his set, Robert
Velasquez's costumes, Beckie Kravitz's masks and Leif Gantvoort's
lighting consistent in their homage to Maxfield Parrish.</TE>
<TE>   The strong-voiced ensemble is most endearing. Purvis recalls the
young William Converse-Roberts, well-matched to Woo's graceful
Eurydell. The three clowns are superbly expressive and funny, and
their colleagues are uniformly fine.</TE>
<TE>   There are discrepancies. The muted visuals, though admirable, fall
short of full-blown wonder, with the tribute ship's eventual
appearance underpowered.</TE>
<TE>   Such sparseness, along with composer Susan Christiansen's emphasis
on ballads and the bittersweet narrative, may prove challenging for
wee attention spans. Their elders, however, should revel in such
charming, meaningful family fare.</TE>

<HD>'Heaven' mixes thriller, allegory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An ominous undercover policeman. An obsessive human rights lawyer. A
juggling junkie. An irreconcilably estranged wife. A rabbi of
conflicted interests. A reluctant police informant. A prototypical
urban park where their seemingly coincidental destinies collide,
leading to an overpopulated afterlife.</LD>
<LD>   These archetypal elements form the foundation of George F.
Walker's 2000 "Heaven," receiving its local premiere at Sacred Fools.
The celebrated Canadian playwright's "millennium play" is a hybrid of
gritty thriller and existential allegory, with results both unkempt
and intriguing.</LD>
<LD>   Walker's idiosyncratic style is an acquired taste. From the
B-movie absurdism of 1974's "Mozambique" and Jacobean pastiche of
1977's "Zastrozzi" to the nihilistic Turgenev reconstruction of
1988's "Fathers and Sons," Walker's iconoclasm sees philosophy and
dramaturgy as inextricable. This dichotomy is central to "Heaven."</LD>
<TE>   The production counts obvious assets in director Maurice Lord's
smooth staging and the adept designs, particularly Carlos Fedos'
skewed setting.</TE>
<TE>   The proficient cast is another plus. Adam Bitterman's riveting cop
shifts from jocular to psychotic on a hairpin trigger, and Sam R.
Ross' defender devolves from manic to moribund with finesse.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Isaac's unwilling patsy has limited range but infinite
commitment, and Johanna McKay's wife is excellent. As the poles of
reason and metaphor, Paul Byrne's rabbi and Crystal Keith's addict
are understated and effective.</TE>
<TE>   What is less so is Walker's ambitious, typically overstuffed
script, which conjoins elements of David Mamet and Dennis Potter
without attaining full cohesion between them. Perhaps this is also
intentional, but less adventurous playgoers should nonetheless
exercise caution.</TE>

<HD>Nappy Roots can't hide hip-hop heart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott T. Sterling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kentucky outfit Nappy Roots puts a black spin on rural Americana,
combining drawn-out Southern slang with bouncy, laid-back beats. Its
homespun tales of being "Country Boyz" have earned them fans in both
the pop and hip-hop worlds. Its debut album, "Watermelon, Chicken &amp;
Gritz," has earned critical accolades and platinum sales.</LD>
<LD>   The easygoing groove of the hit singles "Awnaw" and "Po' Folks"
places the group somewhere between early-'90s feel-good rappers
Arrested Development and current hip-hop kings of the South, OutKast,
but the album reveals deeper facets, with its thoughtful lyrics and
experimental production.</LD>
<LD>   The six rappers and their DJ took the stage at the House of Blues
on Tuesday in an aggressive flurry, charging through such anthems as
"Headz Up" and "Sholiz" while exhorting the crowd to party. While the
diverse audience was receptive to the more testosterone-driven side
of the band, the response to a rousing rendition of "Po' Folks"
suggested that it was the warmer and more melodic tones of the
singles that had brought them out.</LD>
<TE>   With six rappers onstage at almost all times, the energy level had
no chance to flag during the taut hourlong set. By the time the group
wound up the evening with an extended version of the breakout hit
"Awnaw," it was clear that while Nappy Roots surely appreciate
crossing over, they're still hard-core hip-hoppers at heart.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Today, I'm going to teach you about cattails," Uncle Ruben
announced.</LD>
<LD>   Maria and Alfonso had heard of cattails, but they didn't know what
they were. "We're going to walk to the edge of the nearby lake," said
Uncle Ruben, "where many cattails grow in the water there."</LD>
<LD>   Maria and Alfonso were spending the weekend at Uncle Ruben's camp
in the San Bernardino Mountains, where he worked as a guide.</LD>
<TE>   After about 30 minutes, they came to the edge of the lake where
the tall cattails grew.</TE>
<TE>   "See?" said Uncle Ruben. "Those are cattails."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," said Maria. "I knew that! We call them the 'hot dogs on a
stick.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah," added Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, everyone can tell cattails by their flower spike," said
Uncle Ruben. "That 'hot dog on a stick' part is actually the mature
flower."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," Maria and Alfonso said at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   They walked right to the edge of the water, and Uncle Ruben showed
the children the long cattail leaves.</TE>
<TE>   "Native Americans wove mats and baskets from these long leaves,"
explained Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   He then picked one of the mature brown flower spikes and broke it
up on the ground. A huge mountain of cottony fluff appeared and began
to blow about in the wind.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow!" yelled Maria and Alfonso, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I'm going to show you how to make a pillow," said Uncle
Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   Maria and Alfonso just looked at each other and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben pulled a clean pillowcase out of his pack and put 10
mature cattail spikes into the pillowcase.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to seal the opening really well," he explained. "And
now I'm breaking them up inside the pillowcase."</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben let Maria and Alfonso try it too. Before long, they
had a fluffy pillow.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I sleep on it tonight?" asked Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure thing," said Uncle Ruben, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I want one too!" yelled Alfonso.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood history lesson, in four-track stereo</HD>
<DH>The cinematheque celebrates the unheralded history of
magnetic sound with a weeklong series of screenings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Americans were staying home in droves to watch a newfangled
device called television in the late '40s and early '50s, the feature
film world went into a panic trying to figure out ways to lure
audiences back into the theaters. Hollywood soon discovered that a
sure-fire way to get people out of their houses was to make the
movies bigger and louder.</LD>
<LD>   In 1952, moviegoers were treated to the big-screen-experience
travelogue "This Is Cinerama." The following year, 20th Century Fox
introduced the 35-millimeter wide-screen process CinemaScope and
four-track magnetic stereo sound with its religious epic, "The Robe."</LD>
<LD>   When "The Robe" was released, says Dennis Bartok, program manager
of the American Cinematheque, audiences were enraptured with the big
screen image and "hearing sound like they had never heard before. It
really must have been eye-opening and ear-opening. It is something we
take for granted, especially now when you have THX sound systems and
digital sound systems. This was actually a big marketing tool for the
studios."</LD>
<TE>   It is rare to see and hear a four-track magnetic stereo
CinemaScope print these days. "The sound striping on the film itself
was kind of fragile," Bartok says. "It tended to wear out and get
damaged really quickly. If the print wasn't handled carefully, it
would get damaged." Making matters worse, "the magnetic strip over
time would oxidize and that process would hasten the deterioration of
the film print itself."</TE>
<TE>   But the real death knell of four-track magnetic stereo was the
1977 release of "Star Wars" in optical stereo sound. Two of the last
films released in four-track were "Scarface" and "Yentl" in 1983.
"With 'Star Wars,' theater owners started to change over to Dolby
optical," Bartok says. "It was much easier and the prints lasted
longer."</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque is celebrating the unique, rich sound of
four-track magnetic stereo with its weeklong festival, "Dimensions in
Sound: A Celebration of 4-Track Magnetic Stereo in Film!"</TE>
<TE>   The festival opens tonight with an original four-track Technicolor
print of the 1959 production of the Gershwin opera "Porgy &amp; Bess,"
starring Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge. Brock Peters, who is
featured in the film, Hope Preminger, the widow of the film's
director, Otto Preminger, and his brother, Ingo Preminger, are to
appear.</TE>
<TE>   Other films in the festival include the musicals "Thoroughly
Modern Millie" -- co-star Carol Channing is scheduled to attend --
and "Sweet Charity" on Saturday, Brian DePalma's "Scarface" (Dec. 6)
and one of cinema's legendary turkeys, "The Conqueror" (Dec. 7), with
John Wayne as Genghis Khan.</TE>
<TE>   Four-track magnetic stereo involved "striping four separate tracks
of magnetic sound onto the 35-millimeter print, which were read by
magnetic sound heads on [the] projectors themselves," Bartok says.
"The four tracks represented right, left, center and surround sound."</TE>
<TE>   "You would get pops and clicks and noise if it wasn't set up
right," says Jeff Joseph of Sabucat Films, a footage archive company
that is presenting the festival with the cinematheque. But if it was
set up right, the end result was better than today's Dolby digital.
"It is like the musicians are playing for you," Joseph says. "There
is a purity of the sound that modern recording and playback doesn't
usually get."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to find four-track magnetic stereo prints for the festival
was a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened is that we start off with three lists," Joseph
says, "a list of what we'd like to run and a list of what we can
clear the rights to and a list of what prints are available. The
three lists don't coincide that much. As time goes on, the
coincidence is less and less. They are either faded Eastman color
prints or 'vinegar syndrome' prints [the odor means they are
disintegrating] or they have been beaten to death. You are down to
this section of prints that have good color and that are in good
shape and don't smell. This is probably the last festival we'll do
like this."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of prints come from private collectors. "You have to
know these people and get them to cooperate, because there is no
money in this," Joseph says. "Then you hope it is in good shape. I
would say 90% are in good shape. 'The Conqueror' print is almost
brand new. Even though it is from 1956, it almost never got played.
It was a bomb and the print is a virtual mint. It's in four-track
stereo, Technicolor, and it's Victor Young's last score to boot."</TE>
<TE>   The print of "Porgy" is probably the only surviving copy, Joseph
says.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a print at the Long Beach Widescreen Festival a few
years ago, but that has gone to vinegar and was destroyed. This is a
private print. This is going to be the last screening of it. I don't
think the owner is ever going to let it out again. He knows the
cinematheque is going to take good care of it."</TE>
<TE>   The festival, Joseph says, will also feature four-track odds and
ends including four-track stereo trailers and a production short on
"Thoroughly Modern Millie."</TE>
<TE>   Tantalizingly, Joseph adds, "There will be little surprises before
each show."</TE>

<HD>The Bradys take charge of America</HD>

<LD>The title just about says it all: "The Brady Bunch in the White
House."</LD>
<LD>   Talk about the American Dream turned into a nightmare. And yet
there it is in black and white: 8 to 10 tonight on Fox.</LD>
<LD>   Envisioned as a romp, the film certainly fulfills its mission of
being goofy. If only it had a little more common sense to put some of
that silliness in relief.</LD>
<TE>   That's what the first feature film, 1996's "The Brady Bunch
Movie," did successfully, satirizing the improbably wholesome family
by setting it against an all-too-common world laden with crime, greed
and lust.</TE>
<TE>   But tonight's flick is all outlandishness, all the time, from
square one. The plot: Bobby finds a winning lottery ticket, and Mike
insists that the family find its rightful owner. Unbeknownst to them,
the purchaser is being led off to his execution (apparently they have
quick-pick machines on death row).</TE>
<TE>   With no owner coming forward, Mike donates the $67 million to
charity, making the family a symbol of honesty and Mike the perfect
running mate for a president in need of respectability. Just as the
president is about to retake the oath, a scandal erupts and Mike
finds himself moving into the Oval Office, with Carol joining him as
V.P.</TE>
<TE>   Being big-picture types, the Bradys hold Cabinet meetings on such
issues as Marcia's big slumber party -- and an impending meteor
strike that will wipe out life on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   This Brady movie seems to confirm all our worst thoughts about the
bunch, that underneath the veneer of perfection lies something very
dark: a concept hinted at in the first theatrical feature but carried
to extremes here. Now Mike and Carol (Gary Cole and Shelley Long, the
only returning principals from the feature films) are more doltish
than naive; Marcia, Greg, Peter and even Alice more lustful (and the
two eldest siblings borderline incestuous) than romantically awkward;
Cindy and Bobby more annoying than sickeningly sweet; and Jan ...
well, Jan is absolutely psychotic.</TE>
<TE>   All that said, there are still plenty of references to the
original series, inside jokes and real-life politics that generate
some chuckles. But the rest is just high crimes and misdemeanors.</TE>

in September with Lesley McCulloch, a Scottish-born researcher from

<HD>3 Captured in 1999 Killing of 3 Americans</HD>
<DH>Six members of leftist rebel group in Colombia were
indicted by U.S. Victims were kidnapped while helping the Uwa tribe
protest oil drilling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Colombian authorities Thursday captured three leftist guerrillas
wanted in the 1999 kidnapping and killing of three American
activists.</LD>
<LD>   Terence Freitas, Ingrid Washinawatok and Laheenae Gay disappeared
in February 1999 while helping the Uwa tribe in northeastern Colombia
protest drilling by Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. They
were found shot to death a week later in Venezuela.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. and Colombian authorities blamed the killings on the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the largest leftist
rebel group in Colombia, which later admitted that its members were
responsible. In May, the U.S. indicted in absentia six FARC members,
including German Briceno, the brother of the group's
second-in-command.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's arrests of three of the six represent the most recent
sign of an increasingly aggressive cooperation between Colombian and
U.S. authorities in using the justice system to fight Colombia's
leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has unveiled
indictments against the leaders of the paramilitary groups and
guerrillas on charges including terrorism and drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't dismiss that the U.S. might ask for them in extradition,"
said Col. Mario Gutierrez of Colombia's judicial police.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian authorities identified those captured Thursday as
Orlando Triana, 25, Agustin Lopez, 42, and Aroldo Buitrago, 32. It
was unclear whether the men would be extradited to the U.S. or how
long that could take. Another of the six indicted, Nelson Vargas
Rueda, is being held by Colombian authorities pending extradition to
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The men arrested Thursday were captured in small towns near the
region where the Americans were working when they disappeared, about
200 miles northeast of Bogota, the capital. One of the suspects was
working as a butcher and one as a street vendor. The third sold
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian authorities said the operation was the result of an
investigation that has continued since the disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   "We've captured ... three of those implicated in this kidnapping
and homicide," Gutierrez said. "The prosecutors will determine their
level of participation and what their roles were."</TE>
<TE>   Freitas, of Oakland, was working with Washinawatok and Gay in a
violent and unstable region to help Uwa tribe members organize
protests against Occidental, which was drilling an exploratory well
on lands claimed by the tribe. Occidental abandoned the exploration
this year, saying the project was not economically feasible.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment issued in May says that FARC commanders kept in
constant touch with the kidnappers. The kidnappers were told by the
commanders that "those who don't pay get their heads chopped off."</TE>
<TE>   Colombia's guerrillas use kidnappings and the drug trade to help
finance their rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for the killings remains shrouded in mystery. At first,
Colombian authorities maintained that they had intercepted FARC
communications indicating that one of the three Americans had been
bitten by a poisonous animal and was rendered immobile. FARC
commanders then reportedly ordered that all three be shot.</TE>
<TE>   Later, they announced that they possessed another radio
communication indicating that Briceno had ordered the shootings while
drunk.</TE>
<TE>   FARC guerrillas say they have carried out their own trial against
those responsible. The men were ordered to dig trenches as
punishment.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Inspection Team Visits Two Facilities Near Baghdad</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>U.N. experts inspected an animal vaccine production lab and an active
munitions factory Thursday near here on the second day of a hunt for
suspected banned weapons in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The inspections went mostly smoothly, as they did Wednesday, when
the inspectors resumed work after a four-year absence.</LD>
<LD>   The United States has threatened a military assault if Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein obstructs the inspections. Iraq has denied
possessing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.</LD>
<TE>   Two teams of inspectors accompanied by Iraqi officials spent
several hours at the two facilities.</TE>
<TE>   One group went to a foot-and-mouth vaccination laboratory in the
Dora area. The once-government-run facility has been defunct since
weapons inspectors dismantled its equipment in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The other team went to a complex in the Taji area where factories
produce light conventional ammunition and heavy civilian machinery.</TE>
<TE>   At the Dora facility, the inspectors noticed that some equipment
was missing and were told by the Iraqis that it had been moved to
another facility a month ago. When they demanded to see that
facility, they were driven there by the Iraqi minders.</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors also ordered debugging equipment for their
headquarters.</TE>

<HD>Japan Granting Funds to Abductees</HD>
<DH>Bill aims to assist those kidnapped by North Korea and
returned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>TOKYO -- Japan ratcheted up the pressure Thursday on North Korea with
passage of a bill granting financial support to Japanese citizens
abducted by the communist regime.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which applies only to those who have returned from the
reclusive Stalinist state, was unanimously approved by the lower
house of parliament, making it all but certain it will become law
within days. Upper house approval is largely a formality.</LD>
<LD>   Five Japanese returned to Japan in mid-October after North Korea
acknowledged that it had kidnapped 13 people during the 1970s and
'80s to help train its spies.</LD>
<TE>   The law sends a strong signal that Japan will continue to insist
that the returnees be allowed to stay in their homeland permanently.</TE>
<TE>   The five originally came to Japan on a "family visit" and were
supposed to return to North Korea after two or three weeks. Since
their arrival, however, relations between the two wary neighbors have
deteriorated and a standoff has ensued, with the five at the center
of the tug of war.</TE>
<TE>   Tokyo says the returnees -- including Hitomi Soga, the wife of
American soldier Charles Robert Jenkins, who is officially listed by
the Pentagon as a deserter -- have every right to remain here. It
further argues that their spouses and children in North Korea should
be allowed to join them.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea counters that Japan broke its promise, and it says the
five must return.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese bill grants those abducted by North Korea $1,400 a
month, or $2,000 for a couple, plus $250 per child. Various
qualifications must be met, but the payments can last up to five
years.</TE>
<TE>   With this legislation, "we now have the minimum foundation needed
to go to the next level with the abduction issue," said Kazuhiro
Haraguchi, a lawmaker with the opposition Democratic Party of Japan
and part of a group pressing for the return of all those abducted
from North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we need to get to the truth on the other 80 or 90 suspected
victims," he said.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has admitted only that its agents abducted 13
Japanese; it says the eight others died from traffic accidents, heart
attacks and asphyxiation from coal-burning stoves.</TE>
<TE>   Many Japanese have expressed skepticism over the reasons given for
the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Japanese media reported Thursday that North Korean
officials had told Japan that Jenkins had been hospitalized. Reports
of the cause varied, including fatigue and heart disease -- nor was
it clear whether the announcement was a negotiating gambit.</TE>
<TE>   Tokyo has requested more information and called on North Korea to
let Jenkins come to Japan for treatment -- a move that would be
complicated by the fact that he still faces arrest by the U.S.
government on desertion charges.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, who crossed into North Korea in 1965, is 62 years old.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference today, his wife said she was naturally
concerned but would await further information.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as relations between the two countries are concerned, I
have faith in the Japanese government," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The news that Japan plans to extend official support to those
abducted by North Korea has also sparked criticism from other groups
who feel they deserve similar treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to eventually expand the idea to other victims of
international crime, as well as Japanese left behind in China after
World War II," Haraguchi said.</TE>
<TE>   Others within the government are wary, however, that expanding the
scope of the assistance could awaken sensitive, war-related issues.</TE>
<TE>   At a first-ever North Korean-Japanese summit in September in
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, communist officials confessed
that "overzealous agents" had abducted the Japanese.</TE>

<HD>Death Toll Mounts in Attacks Targeting Israelis in Kenya</HD>
<DH>Three tourists, nine tribal dancers and three terrorists
die in a hotel bombing. Two missiles just miss a nearby jet with 271
people aboard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ and ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MSUMARINI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>The death toll in a suicide car bombing at a resort hotel here
climbed to at least 15 people Thursday as officials said one of two
missiles fired at the time of the blast came close enough to an
Israeli jet taking off nearby to slightly damage the tail.</LD>
<LD>   The two heat-seeking missiles passed by the jet, and the Arkia
Charter Co. flight with 271 people on board was able to land safely
in Tel Aviv a few hours later.</LD>
<LD>   The car bombing Thursday morning tore through the Paradise hotel,
which caters almost exclusively to Israeli tourists, and triggered a
fire that severely damaged much of the building. At least nine
Kenyans, three Israelis and the three suicide bombers were among the
dead, according to police at the scene. The bodies of the Israelis
were being returned to Israel today. Two of the victims were
brothers, ages 12 and 13. More than 60 people were wounded, some of
them seriously.</LD>
<TE>   A previously unknown group calling itself the Army of Palestine
claimed responsibility for the attacks in a fax to the media, but
government officials in Kenya and Israel, along with terrorism
experts, said the operation was well coordinated and bore the
trademarks of Al Qaeda or an affiliated group.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know yet if it's Al Qaeda, but it looks like it," said
Jonathan Peled, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, Texas, President Bush condemned the attacks. "Those
who seek peace must do everything in their power to dismantle the
infrastructure of terror that makes such actions possible," he said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparently separate attack, six Israelis were killed and at
least 16 moderately to seriously injured Thursday in the northern
Israeli town of Beit Shean when two Palestinian gunmen fired
indiscriminately into crowds near the local bus station, which is
near a polling site where people were voting in the Likud Party
primary.</TE>
<TE>   The attack in Kenya came about 8:30 a.m., as dancers from a
Mombasa coastal tribe dressed in tie-dye and grass skirts were
welcoming in Swahili arriving guests at the Paradise hotel. Security
guards and witnesses said a green Mitsubishi Pajero sport utility
vehicle pulled up to the gate but was denied entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle, carrying three men who appeared to be Arabs, reversed
several yards, rammed the gate and sped toward the reception area.
One man jumped out of the vehicle, threw what witnesses said were
grenades and then blew himself up. Seconds later, the vehicle
exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel guests and staff, covered with dust and streaked with blood,
ran for the nearby beach as the hotel's thatched roof went up in
flames, sending billows of smoke into the air. The fire destroyed
most of the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Police on the scene said they believed that the entire dance
troupe was killed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "People were screaming, calling for their family members, who were
running for the ocean" or the bushes that surround the resort, said
Zev Wegh, 54, a graphic designer with Yediot Aharonot, Israel's
largest daily newspaper, who was vacationing at the resort.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second major terrorist attack in Kenya in recent years.
The United States blamed Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network
for 1998 truck bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in which 224 people were killed and
thousands injured.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government immediately flew a medical team to Mombasa
to treat and evacuate the wounded. Israeli military Hercules
transport aircraft were expected to arrive within hours to evacuate
the uninjured Israelis; teams of forensic and bomb experts also were
dispatched by the Israeli government.</TE>
<TE>   Although Israelis regularly face suicide bombings and other
attacks by Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
they have not been a regular target of recent suspected Al Qaeda
attacks. A synagogue in Tunisia was the target of an April terrorist
attack for which Al Qaeda took responsibility; 21 people were killed,
none of them Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   However, in his most recent statement, Bin Laden deplored Israel's
military offensive against the Palestinians and particularly attacks
that killed "old people, women and children." Israel has often said
it is only trying to protect itself from attacks by Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts noted that the hotel and missile attacks were well
coordinated and well organized and relied on local knowledge, a
trademark of Al Qaeda. Although no one was killed or injured in the
missile attack, it was the first time terrorists have used such a
tactic, and it points to a previously overlooked area of
vulnerability, one that potentially affects tourist destinations all
over the world. While many airports in capital cities have broad and
tightly secured perimeters, such security measures are rare in
smaller tourist destinations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to defend aircraft from such a strategic threat," said
Pini Schiff, deputy director general of Israel's Airport Authority.
"The state of Israel and security authorities are doing their best in
and out of the country to address this issue, [but] our sovereignty
in airports around the world is limited, and at times the adversary
has the upper hand in his ability to use such a weapon in an open
space."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called on the Israeli public
to eschew fear and stand up to attackers. "We fight terrorism all the
time and everywhere," he said at an evening news conference. "We will
fight everyone who tries and unfortunately sometimes succeeds in
hurting us."</TE>
<TE>   He then struck a domestic note, urging Israelis not to be afraid
to go to the polls in Thursday's Likud Party primary, in which he
later defeated Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "Don't let
terrorism frighten you; don't let terrorism influence you; go and
vote," he told the country. With the primary victory, Sharon will
face Labor Party candidate Amram Mitzna in January national
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon gave the Mossad secret service responsibility for the
investigation into the Kenya attacks. "Our long arm will get those
who carried out the terror attacks. No one will be forgiven," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   American investigators were also on the scene. The United States
has had a large FBI presence in Nairobi since the 1998 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the Kenya hotel attack, a group of 164 Israeli tourists had
just arrived from Tel Aviv for a stay over the Hanukkah holidays.
They were just completing hotel check-in when the Pajero pulled up to
the gate.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Israelis had brought Hanukkah candles, and a large
menorah was set up in the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought it would be a nice, peaceful way to spend the
holidays," said Yigal Cohen, a lawyer for the Paradise Mombasa Co. in
Tel Aviv, a related travel company.</TE>
<TE>   The Paradise hotel, which attracts both sunbathers and tourists
who want to take safaris in nearby game reserves, is frequented
almost exclusively by Israelis, who arrive on charter flights every
Thursday for weeklong stays. It has tight security, not out of fear
of terrorist attacks but to keep out locals, Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Highly flammable native thatch is used for the large lobby roof as
well as elsewhere in the resort.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire resort is made of typically African and native
materials, such as wood and straw. The paths, the roofs, the
banisters -- everything is extremely flammable, and it is easy to see
how the guests would have been engulfed in flames almost
instantaneously," said Aharon Domb, the director general of the
Israeli Tourism Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   It took only a few minutes for the hotel to be nearly destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people had no choice but to jump out of their windows," Domb
said. "Luckily, the entire guest complex was only three stories
high."</TE>
<TE>   Elvis Dzombo, a 24-year-old stockroom worker, was standing near
the reception area when the explosion occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a matter of running for your life," he said, pressing a
bloody white bandage to a gash on his face. "I thank God I found my
exit." The attack did not surprise security experts, who note East
Africa's proximity to Yemen and Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Mombasa is a port city through which many foreigners pass.
Security experts note that Kenya lacks the computerized immigration
system and passport scanning devices used in the United States and
many European countries. And although only 15% of Kenya's population
is Muslim, Mombasa also is the area with the largest and most radical
Islamic population, said Jonathan Stevenson, a terrorism expert at
the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.</TE>
<TE>   Other terrorism experts made similar points.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda has operated in Kenya, and we know they have a good
infrastructure there, we know they have good connections with local
organizations in Africa that they may have been using as proxies,"
said Yoram Schweitzer, an Israeli expert in global terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   One witness described the hotel's attackers as calm, even
cheerful, in the moments before the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "They looked so relaxed," said Dreesen Maye, 30, who works as a
tour guide for the hotel and saw the Pajero driving slowly up to the
front gates. "I saw them talking and laughing."</TE>
<TE>   The missile attack, which apparently was launched near the Mombasa
airport, appeared to involve more than one person. Israeli Foreign
Ministry spokesman Peled said two heat-seeking, Russian-made missiles
known as SA-7s were launched at Arkia Flight 582 a few minutes after
it took off.</TE>
<TE>   A missile launcher was found later on the ground near the airport.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot, Rafi Marek, a 13-year veteran of Arkia, said everything
was normal when the plane took off. Then, he said, "we felt a light
thump on the plane, and my first association, based on my experience,
is that a small bird hit the plane. But we noticed two white tails of
some smoke go past us on our left ... and disintegrate within
moments."</TE>
<TE>   It was not until later that Marek concluded that the plane had
been targeted.</TE>

<HD>Soldiers Enjoy American Bounty Amid Possibility of War</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAMP NEW YORK, Kuwait</DL>
<LD>Standing guard Thursday outside the Skybridge mess hall in this U.S.
Army tent city in the desert just 15 miles from Iraq, there was a
live, 10-pound American turkey -- and scores of 70-ton American
tanks.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, a giant-screen Zenith Digital Home Theater played American
videos, sheet cakes bore the Statue of Liberty, the American flag and
a biblical passage from Corinthians, and there was food "enough for
an army," said Col. David Perkins, commander of the 2nd Brigade.</LD>
<LD>   By day's end, Perkins and his officer corps had dished out to the
brigade's nearly 4,000 U.S. soldiers in this and three similar camps
on Iraq's desolate southern doorstep about 1,000 pounds of imported
turkey, 2,500 pounds of roast beef, 96 cases of candied yams, 42
cases of stuffing, 5,000 rolls and assorted pies.</LD>
<TE>   For Perkins, there was a powerful message in the meal, far beyond
simple American tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a tribute to our nation that it has the wealth and
the willpower to give them this kind of quality of life in a place
like this," the 44-year-old from New Hampshire said.</TE>
<TE>   And as his brigade trains here for possible war with Iraq, Perkins
added, the holiday message to his troops carries even greater weight.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them, 'If you end up headed north, you'll soon discover
you're thousands of miles from home and you are being better taken
care of and better fed than the Iraqi soldiers who are in their own
country.' We don't consider our soldiers fodder."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Perkins and his 2nd Brigade, part of the 3rd Infantry
Division out of Ft. Stewart in Georgia, are here just for training, a
regularly scheduled exercise called Desert Spring that began two
months ago. Perkins said the training has made his forces both
combat-ready and deserving of a day off.</TE>
<TE>   The Army is using these well-equipped and heavily fortified bases
for live-fire artillery drills and mock war games that simulate a
ground offensive into Kuwait's neighbor to the north. The camps are
named for the states that suffered the most casualties in last year's
Sept. 11 attacks. Each camp covers miles of desert and provides
air-conditioned barracks tents, video libraries, Internet rooms,
sophisticated satellite communication centers and telephone trailers.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the U.S. military has expanded its presence in
this nation it helped liberate from Iraqi occupation almost 12 years
ago, doubling the number of personnel to more than 12,000.</TE>
<TE>   A small contingent of Marines from Camp Pendleton arrived a few
weeks ago and has been building yet another desert base, Camp
Commando, which would house Marines in any future conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at what we've done," camp commander Col. John Cunnings
proudly told his detachment from the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force,
after a taped Thanksgiving Day bagpipe rendition. "We've built a
whole city."</TE>
<TE>   For most here, Thursday was a quiet oasis of reflection and
celebration amid what appears to some a gathering storm of war.</TE>
<TE>   As Col. Perkins put it: "There's the very real possibility of
conflict.... And the proximity of conflict just gives [Thanksgiving]
that added significance. It makes the people here more reflective and
more thankful."</TE>
<TE>   At least a third of the Army soldiers here have been deployed in
conflict zones before: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haiti, Kosovo province and
even the 1991 Persian Gulf War. For many, Thursday was not the first
holiday away from home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a little hard spending time away from family,
especially on the holidays," said Spc. Al Arias, 22, of Whittier, a
gunner with a tank crew at Camp New York. "But we really don't have
that much to complain about. We've got food, tents, and we look after
each other."</TE>
<TE>   Many others interviewed in the camps, from buck privates to task
force commanders, spoke of their company, detachment or battalion as
a second family.</TE>
<TE>   "I have family back home too, and I miss them," said Lt. Col.
Stephen Twitty, a 17-year Army veteran from South Carolina who
commands a 750-member task force that includes a tank company, and
chemical-defense and air-defense platoons.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Thanksgiving Day celebrations, the 39-year-old lieutenant
colonel added: "Without a doubt in my mind, it sends a message....
The United States of America is willing to stand up for what's
right.... I'm glad to be here so my daughter won't be here in 10
years."</TE>
<TE>   And to the Iraqis, he said, the message is, "When you're free, you
can get stuff like this."</TE>
<TE>   That imagery was repeated in camp after camp across Kuwait's
northern desert, about 1,600 square miles -- one-fourth of the nation
-- that has been sealed off by U.S. and Kuwaiti forces for the
exercises.</TE>
<TE>   A boombox blared Jay-Z, Scarface and Tupac Shakur in the shadow of
a long row of towering 155-millimeter howitzers at Camp Virginia, 20
miles south of Camp New York, as half a dozen members of a Multiple
Launch Rocket System team played a game of three-on-three on a new
basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what our job is. We know what to do," said Spc. Robert
Greenleaf, 25, of Muncie, Ind., during a game break. "But we got to
relax too. You can't do this job all stressed out. Mostly, what I'm
feeling this Thanksgiving is, when you come to another country in a
situation like this, you got to appreciate what you've got in
America."</TE>
<TE>   The most powerful message, though, came late in the afternoon
inside the dining tent at Camp New York.</TE>
<TE>   In an opening prayer, Capt. John Jensen, chaplain of the 10th
Engineering Battalion, said: "Thank you God for the freedom we enjoy.
Thank you for the families we can miss."</TE>
<TE>   And the icing on the cake carried a biblical quote from II
Corinthians 9:11: "Being enriched in everything to all bountifulness,
which causeth through us thanksgiving to God."</TE>

<HD>Sharon Crushes Netanyahu</HD>
<DH>Israeli prime minister retains leadership of the Likud
Party with about 60% of the vote. The celebrations are muted amid
terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon crushed rival Benjamin Netanyahu in a
contest Thursday for the leadership of their rightist Likud Party,
setting the Israeli leader on the path to probable victory in
January's general elections.</LD>
<LD>   The lopsided primary vote -- with about 60% backing for Sharon --
came on a day shadowed by terror attacks against Israelis at home and
overseas, including a shooting at a Likud polling place in the
northern Israeli town of Beit Shean that left six Israelis dead and
dozens wounded. The two Palestinian gunmen were also killed.</LD>
<LD>   "What happened today ... was part of an effort by terrorists to
affect the democratic system in Israel," a weary-looking, hoarse
Sharon told supporters at a muted victory celebration at party
headquarters in Tel Aviv early today. "We won't surrender to terror,
and we will win."</LD>
<TE>   Against a backdrop of relentless violence that has dragged on for
26 months, Likud voters appeared to embrace the prime minister's
brand of tough on-the-ground military measures against the
Palestinians, tempered by a stated openness toward a negotiated
solution that could lead to Palestinian statehood.</TE>
<TE>   During the brief primary campaign, Netanyahu tried to outflank
Sharon on the right, advocating measures such as the expulsion of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and repeatedly
declaring his opposition to Palestinian statehood.</TE>
<TE>   But by a 3-2 ratio, the voters backed the more moderate policy
crafted by Sharon during his 21 months in office. About 305,000
registered Likud members were eligible to cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the prime minister has bowed, for the most part,
to the wish of the Bush administration to avoid any major escalation
in the conflict with the Palestinians during the run-up to potential
war in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into the Jan. 28 general elections, Likud holds a
commanding lead in the polls over the left-leaning Labor Party, led
since last week by Amram Mitzna, the dovish mayor of Haifa.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzna, like so many Israeli politicians a former army general,
has said he would restart peace talks with the Palestinians without
preconditions and move to pull Israeli troops and settlers out of the
Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   For Sharon, the overwhelming endorsement by his own party -- and
the likelihood of victory in January -- caps what has been a
remarkable political rehabilitation. Once considered the hardest of
hard-line hawks, he spent years on the margins of government after
being indirectly blamed, during his tenure as defense minister in the
1980s, for the massacre of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon by
Christian militiamen.</TE>
<TE>   However, since his election in February 2001, the 74-year-old
Sharon has successfully cultivated a statesmanlike, grandfatherly
image, repairing tattered relations with leading figures on Israel's
political left. He has said he hopes to once again build a "national
unity" government encompassing those who were once his bitterest
political foes.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, analysts say, Sharon has managed to gain the
confidence of voters as the man who may be able to lead the country
out of grinding warfare with the Palestinians -- even as the two
sides endure the region's worst violence in a generation. Israel has
been hit by an unprecedented wave of Palestinian suicide attacks, and
Palestinians suffer daily privations and frequent civilian casualties
amid an Israeli military clampdown in many towns and cities of the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "In the broadest sense, it's all about security," said political
analyst Mark Heller. "I think the impulse by Israeli voters is to
seek a steady hand at the helm, a wish to avoid adventurism, and a
knowledge that there's no silver bullet."</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu, who has served as Sharon's foreign minister for the
past 3 1/2 weeks, conceded the race without waiting for official
results, soon after exit polls showed him losing by a decisive
margin. Faced with projected results of 61% of the vote going to
Sharon and 37% to him, Netanyahu called Sharon to congratulate him.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we must work for a united Likud," he told supporters at a Tel
Aviv hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The 53-year-old former prime minister's reputation for political
agility -- derided by many as slickness -- did not hold up well
during this campaign outing. Netanyahu stumbled from the outset, his
policy criticisms of Sharon going largely unanswered by the prime
minister, except in the form of deft, indirect rebukes.</TE>
<TE>   Even in a political culture in which heavy-handedness is not
perceived as a liability, Netanyahu offended many Israelis with an ad
campaign touting the fact that there were only four suicide bombings
during his 1996-99 term as prime minister -- well before the current
outbreak of violence began. With Israeli nerves rubbed raw by
constant attacks, the intended jab at Sharon was widely viewed as
disrespectful toward the victims.</TE>
<TE>   If Sharon does prevail over Mitzna as expected in January, a
second term would bring a measure of stability to Israel's turbulent
political scene. These elections will be the fourth national contest
in as many years.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon supporters gathered at the Tel Aviv headquarters, watching
with satisfaction as the projections came in, but any overt
celebration was avoided in the wake of terror attacks earlier in the
day near Mombasa, Kenya, against Israeli tourists and an Israeli
airliner, and the one in Beit Shean.</TE>
<TE>   Those injured in the shooting in Israel included three sons of
former Foreign Minister David Levy, a senior Likud official.
Passengers waiting at an open-air bus terminal were also sprayed with
gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah
faction, claimed responsibility for the attack in calls to Western
news agencies, but Arafat's Palestinian Authority condemned the
shooting, saying it damaged the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon had planned to spend much of election day in seclusion at
his ranch in the Negev desert, but he rushed to Tel Aviv for security
consultations after the early-morning attacks in Kenya. Two missiles
were fired at a chartered Israeli airliner, missing it but slightly
damaging its tail, and a hotel near Mombasa that caters to Israelis
was blown up by suicide bombers, killing at least three Israelis and
nine Kenyans.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister ordered the Mossad intelligence agency to take
the lead in investigating -- and perhaps retaliating for -- the Kenya
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's more than comfortable win had been predicted for weeks in
the polls, but in Israel, such surveys are notoriously unreliable,
especially in primaries. The Sharon camp fretted until the last
minute that complacency would keep backers away, but final results
bore out the large victory margin.</TE>
<TE>   After the Beit Shean attack, Sharon urged Likud members to go
ahead with the vote, telling a news conference, "We cannot allow the
murderers to disrupt our lives."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Sharon and Netanyahu, a third, fringe candidate,
Moshe Feiglin, was in the race, garnering about 3%.</TE>

<HD>Twin Strikes Carry Marks of Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Attacks may be an effort to trigger an Israeli response and
a unified Muslim backlash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella and Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The place, style and timing of twin terror attacks on Israelis in
Kenya on Thursday are signatures with the handwriting of a prime
suspect: the Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement officials and counter-terrorism experts in Europe,
the United States and Israel said it was too soon to conclude that
the bombing of a resort near Mombasa that caters to Israelis and the
simultaneous missile attack on an Israeli charter flight taking off
nearby were definitely the work of Osama bin Laden's organization.</LD>
<LD>   A few experts thought Palestinian groups or Hezbollah, which has a
history of hitting Israeli targets around the world, might have been
involved.</LD>
<TE>   But overall, veterans of the fight against Al Qaeda saw the
carnage in Kenya as part of the resurgent terror network's widening
war against the West. In a global counterattack since the U.S.
invasion of Afghanistan, an increasingly decentralized Al Qaeda has
expanded beyond its once exclusive focus on U.S. targets to single
out American allies with bombings from Pakistan to Tunisia to the
Indonesian island of Bali.</TE>
<TE>   The terror network has accompanied the mayhem with unusually
specific threats against countries that include Australia, Germany,
Italy -- and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "The preferred target is still the U.S., but it's harder to hit
the U.S. now," said Jonathan Stevenson of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London. "They have become more flexible.
They will hit soft European targets and any Western Christian, and
now any Israeli, will do. They want to hit civilians and anyone they
see as inimical to Islam."</TE>
<TE>   If Al Qaeda is to blame for Thursday's attacks, the organization
appears to have opened an ominous new front in its campaign to rally
the Muslim world to its cause, experts said. After years of verbal
violence against Jews and Israel, they said, Bin Laden's forces
spilled Israeli blood at a moment of maximum Middle East tension.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent intent: to push Israel into a more prominent role in
the U.S.-led war on terror and trigger a backlash among Muslims
already incited by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the U.S.
confrontation with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to unify the Arab nationalist struggle by identifying
with the Palestinian cause," said Roland Jacquard, a French
counter-terrorism consultant and author of the recent book "The
Secret Archives of Al Qaeda." "If you draw Israel into the war on
terror, you pour fuel on the fire. They have done it at the moment of
a possible war with Iraq because they want to unify all Arabs."</TE>
<TE>   In videotaped and written communiques, Bin Laden has heaped abuse
on Israel and claimed solidarity with Palestinians. Al Qaeda's
simultaneous 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
were carried out in the name of a front organization dedicated to
killing "Crusaders [Christians] and Jews."</TE>
<TE>   And in a symbolically charged act that was allegedly coordinated
by Al Qaeda's military chief in Pakistan, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, via
satellite phone, a suicide truck bomber killed French and German
tourists outside a historic synagogue on the Tunisian island of
Djerba in April.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to hit Israelis was probably made by a high-ranking
figure, according to Jacquard. That may have been the next logical
step in an evolving military and political strategy, according to
Daniel Benjamin, a former National Security Council counter-terrorism
official and coauthor of "The Age of Sacred Terror."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense the group is refocusing on Israeli and Jewish
targets," Benjamin said. "Al Qaeda has been trying to increase its
profile in the Middle East and to establish a foothold in the
Arab-Israeli conflict, and this would certainly help it achieve that
goal."</TE>
<TE>   The circumstantial evidence suggests Al Qaeda involvement,
according to Benjamin and others. As the 1998 embassy bombings made
clear, the network has had an entrenched infrastructure in Kenya,
specifically in the Mombasa area.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the precision and choreography of the simultaneous
strikes recall the Sept. 11 hijackings as well as the African embassy
bombings. In an additional wrinkle, the terrorists used different
weapons on distinct groups of Israeli tourists, one that had just
arrived at the Mombasa beach resort and another that was departing by
air.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of synchronized attacks using different modes in one
operation is a classic hallmark of Al Qaeda," Benjamin said.</TE>
<TE>   As in Tunisia and the bombing of a Bali nightclub last month, in
which investigators allege an Al Qaeda connection, the intended human
casualties were tourists, with a secondary economic target: the
tourist industry. This reflects Al Qaeda's adjustment to a post-Sept.
11 reality in which it is weaker, yet more elusive, the experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military and law enforcement campaign against terrorism
has wiped out Al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan, left a number of
its leaders dead or captured and disrupted its operations and
finances. The terrorists have been forced away from preferred targets
such as U.S. embassies and bases, which have built up their defenses.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is Al Qaeda, it is paradoxically a reflection of the
success we're having in our struggle against them," said Bruce
Hoffman of the Rand Corp. "This may be demonstrating that the targets
they would most like to get are too difficult for them to hit. The
tragedy, of course, is that they're merely shifting their attention
to more accessible and softer targets, with extremely tragic
consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Because Al Qaeda was always a loose alliance of networks with
limited hierarchy and considerable autonomy, it has survived through
metamorphosis, taking refuge in more than 60 countries and
counterattacking on multiple battlefields.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to show they have no limits, no borders," an Italian
counter-terrorism investigator said. "That they can hit anywhere. The
message is that they have reorganized and they are going to carry out
the threats they have made."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Al Qaeda is not the only possible culprit in the
Kenya case. Lebanon-based Hezbollah has a history of sophisticated
terrorist acts against Jewish targets outside Israel. Hezbollah
operatives, supervised and financed by Iranian intelligence agents,
allegedly committed two attacks in Argentina, according to
authorities: the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy that killed 29
people and the bombing of a Jewish community center two years later
that killed 85.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of exclusively Israeli targets is consistent with
Hezbollah, according to Vince Cannistraro, a former counterterrorism
official at the CIA. So was the quick claim of responsibility from an
unknown group calling itself the Army of Palestine, he said, because
Hezbollah often invents groups to take credit for attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be very cautious in ascribing this to Al Qaeda,"
Cannistraro said. "Hezbollah really invented suicide bombings, not Al
Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian terrorists also are potential culprits. Cannistraro
said the Israeli clampdown on the Palestinian territories has reduced
terrorists' ability to smuggle in weapons and carry out attacks in
the region. As a result, he said, Palestinian militants may have
turned to overseas targets, reviving a practice that was common 20
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "What this signals is that we're back to the worldwide attacks
that we saw on Israelis in the 1970s," Cannistraro said. Striking a
beach hotel in Kenya is far easier than hitting an Israeli embassy,
Cannistraro said. "There are not a lot of soft Israeli targets around
the world."</TE>
<TE>   As Islamic terrorist organizations find common cause in the
post-Sept. 11 battlefield, there is another troublesome scenario,
according to Jacquard. Hezbollah and Al Qaeda could have teamed up to
strike Israel. Investigations have revealed contacts and cooperation
between the two organizations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both have Russian SA-7 Strella missiles of the type believed to
have been fired Thursday at the Boeing 757 operated by Arkia, an
Israeli charter airline, according to experts.</TE>
<TE>   The use of the missiles revives a longtime nightmare for law
enforcement. While large airports, particularly those in capitals,
usually have secure perimeters, there are probably hundreds of
airports in smaller cities and tourist destinations that have little
in the way of perimeter security.</TE>
<TE>   That matters because it is difficult to hit a plane with a
shoulder-fired missile once it is in the air, but planes are most
vulnerable while still on the runway or just taking off, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue of missiles is a complex and intricate threat," said
Israel Borovich, the president and chief executive officer of Arkia.
"It is definitely taken into consideration by the security services
... [but] this is an incident you cannot train for."</TE>
<TE>   The Mombasa airport may have been hit because planes tend to fly
low after taking off over the seashore, gaining altitude more
gradually than in other airports.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an accident that Mombasa was chosen for such an attack,"
said Eitan Ben-Eliyahu, a former major general and chief of the
Israeli air force. "After takeoff, planes fly low there, which makes
a strike easier. Had one of the missiles hit the plane, it would have
been very bad."</TE>
<TE>   The bloodshed on the beach, then, only reinforces the fear felt by
Americans, Europeans, Israelis and other Westerners just about
anywhere. The rhythm of the violence has not faltered; it seems
likely to speed up, according to some experts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the closer we get to war [with Iraq], there's going to be
more and more attacks," said Robert Baer, a former CIA officer with
extensive Middle East experience.</TE>
<TE>   And because the always shadowy Al Qaeda has gone further
underground, police and intelligence agencies continue to wrestle
with a high-stakes question: Is this wide-ranging flurry of small and
medium-sized attacks the most the organization can muster? Or is the
offensive designed to keep the West off-balance while terrorists
prepare a large-scale plot comparable to the Sept. 11 attacks?</TE>
<TE>   "The rhythm is very worrisome," Jacquard said. "You had the same
kind of situation before Sept. 11. You had groups with autonomy doing
operations in different places that occupied and distracted the
authorities while an elite group prepared the big attack."</TE>

<HD>A Boost for Urban Shoppers</HD>
<DH>Escalators that move carts between floors are enabling
large retailers to build multilevel stores in areas where space is at
a premium.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The mightiest retailer in the world, Wal-Mart, looked like the last,
best hope for the vacant, long-troubled anchor spot at Crenshaw Plaza
-- if only it would fit.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other big-box discounters favor the
wide-open spaces of suburban shopping centers, using 18 or more acres
for a store and parking lot. The empty department store at Baldwin
Hills Crenshaw Plaza in central Los Angeles, by comparison, crams the
equivalent of two acres onto five floors.</LD>
<LD>   But in January, Wal-Mart plans to open a multilevel store at
Crenshaw Plaza -- and it's all possible because of a 50-year-old
machine that can best be described as an escalator for shopping
carts.</LD>
<TE>   The device, common in Europe but relatively new in the United
States, is allowing Wal-Mart, Target Corp. and other retailers to
bring multistory versions of their giant discount stores to urban
areas that have struggled to provide the kind of shopping options the
suburbs long have enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other way to build a Wal-Mart store in a neighborhood
like Crenshaw," said company spokesman Robert McAdam. "There's just
not enough land to make it work. You have to take something over, and
the only way to make that work is by using a cart escalator."</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be the first time that technology helped change the
urban landscape. Elevators made the high-rise possible, sending
cities into the sky. Freeways paved the way for suburban development,
which in turn left swaths of inner-city areas empty and blighted.</TE>
<TE>   The cart conveyor systems, to hear some boosters and urban
planning experts tell it, will help fuel a new phase, bringing
commerce back to the urban core.</TE>
<TE>   "Will this little machine change everything? No. Does it get over
a major obstacle for city development? Absolutely," said Richmond
McCoy, president of UrbanAmerica, an inner-city real estate
development company. "It can be an anchor for further economic
investment, and that's what has to happen for these cities to
change."</TE>
<TE>   David Pelczmann, a onetime conveyor salesman, believed in the
machines' potential enough to buy the German company that makes them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a sexy product -- it's nuts, bolts, steel and doesn't
talk," said Pelczmann, owner of Darrott Inc. "But it is fundamental
to the redevelopment of the urban areas. It is the only way you are
going to get rid of the desolation left by the migration to the
suburbs."</TE>
<TE>   Most big discount chains got their start outside cities. As the
competition and costs in the suburbs grew, however, the retailers
recognized that urban areas -- with their dense concentration of
consumers -- represent a golden, untapped market.</TE>
<TE>   Still, entering urban environments posed significant challenges:
The stores would have to be multilevel because of limited space, and
yet shoppers would have to be able to travel easily between floors
with bulky carts.</TE>
<TE>   Discount retailers depend on people piling in as many goods as
possible to make up for slim profits on individual items. Without
carts, customers won't buy as much.</TE>
<TE>   Target tried to use king-size elevators to accommodate carts when
the retailer opened a Pasadena store in 1994. But company executives
soon realized that elevators have limited capacity and subject
shoppers to annoying waits.</TE>
<TE>   The cart conveyor systems, by comparison, speed shoppers and their
carts between floors along parallel tracks. Resembling side-by-side
escalators, the escalator and cart conveyor combination also allows
shoppers to maintain a view of the store's surroundings -- key to
their being able to move quickly to their destination after
disembarking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like a ride at Disneyland," said Michele Breslauer,
a 36-year-old lawyer, as she put her cart on the conveyor at Target
in Van Nuys. "Once you do it, you're fine. I think it's great because
the elevators are a hassle."</TE>
<TE>   Added Adriana West, 30, of Tarzana: "You don't have to wait -- you
just hop right on."</TE>
<TE>   Some civic planners contend that big-box stores are no panacea for
urban ills, because they drive smaller merchants out and primarily
offer low-paying work.</TE>
<TE>   However, developers and others say the giant discounters bring
sales tax revenue, low-cost goods and jobs to areas that need them.</TE>
<TE>   By most accounts, the credit for bringing the cart conveyor to the
U.S. belongs to IKEA. The Sweden-based furniture seller installed its
first U.S. system in its Carson store in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Target, hoping to build a competitive advantage by
moving into urban markets, that saw the potential for using the
machines to transform older buildings into modern discount stores.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew these areas were underserved, and we knew that in order
for us to grow, we'd have to be in some of those areas," Target's
communications chief, Carolyn Brookter, said. "We didn't want to bury
our heads and say we couldn't figure it out."</TE>
<TE>   California became the top laboratory, offering dense pockets of
consumers and cities littered with empty shells from department store
mergers and bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   Target opened its initial cart conveyor-equipped store in 1995, in
a former department store in La Mesa, near San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   After testing its first multilevel store in Pasadena, Target was
eager to open others but concluded that the slow and clunky cart
elevators were not up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   The company's architects briefly considered ramp conveyors, used
at some grocery stores, in which the customers ride behind their
carts on a moving incline. But the ramp conveyors are slower and
require more space than the stair-stepped escalator systems.</TE>
<TE>   It was an elevator consultant in California who pointed Target
architects to the escalator-like contraption, called a Vermaport, at
IKEA's Carson store.</TE>
<TE>   Though almost unheard of in the United States, Vermaports have
been sold since 1956 throughout Europe and Asia, where population
density and limited space bumped up against the modern retail
megastore.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Newhouse, an architect and design project manager with
Target, was all but sold on the idea after he spent an afternoon at
IKEA, watching customers' easy acceptance of the system.</TE>
<TE>   He became a believer during a trip to Europe, and he consulted
Pelczmann, then the U.S. agent for Transport Technik (now Darrott),
which makes the Vermaport.</TE>
<TE>   Pelczmann had sent pictures and a description of the Vermaport to
nearly every major supermarket chain. But his phone hadn't rung
before Target came calling.</TE>
<TE>   Newhouse, armed with photos, cost comparisons and design plans,
had little trouble persuading Target's senior management back in
Minneapolis to take a chance on a one-store test. But there were
hitches.</TE>
<TE>   First, the company couldn't find an inspector to approve the
Vermaport, because neither the elevator inspector nor the local
building engineer could decide how to classify the contraption. There
also was a need to make changes to meet U.S. safety standards.</TE>
<TE>   Target added two swinging plastic panels to keep children from
wandering onto the belt and placed signs directing parents not to
leave their children in the cart while it was on the conveyor.</TE>
<TE>   On the store's opening day in 1995, the question was whether
shoppers would accept the odd-looking machines -- and what Target
would do if they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nerve-racking," Newhouse said. "People understood how
elevators work, they understood how escalators work. Would they
understand this?"</TE>
<TE>   Target stationed clerks at the top and bottom of each escalator to
demonstrate and to keep children and strollers off the machines. For
most people, Newhouse said, the Vermaport was a fun new display. Many
shoppers stopped just to watch the merchandise-filled carts ride up
and down.</TE>
<TE>   "It opened up all sorts of possibilities," Newhouse said. "We
moved, and we moved fast."</TE>
<TE>   After La Mesa, Target quickly opened two Bay Area stores with cart
escalators. From there, Target introduced the system around the
country, opening stores in sites that other large-format retailers
might never have considered, including Van Nuys, Eagle Rock, three
stores in Washington, D.C., and one in Queens, N.Y. It now has 22
stores equipped with what Target calls "cartveyors."</TE>
<TE>   Other retailers followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart opened its first multilevel store in 1998, taking over
the old Broadway store in Panorama City's nearly 50-year-old Panorama
Mall and installing the company's first in-store cart conveyor
system.</TE>
<TE>   The company next year will roll out its multilevel model,
installing cart conveyors at the new Wal-Mart in Crenshaw and at four
other sites around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Great Indoors and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc.
also have slowly begun trying out multilevel stores and cart
conveyors.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, Darrott had doubled the number of Vermaports sold in the
U.S., with orders for 48, Pelczmann said. That also was the year a
Wisconsin company, Pflow Industries Inc., introduced its own cart
conveyor system for customers including Target.</TE>
<TE>   Though sales are slow for the systems, which can cost several
hundred thousand dollars each, urban planners and others are
heartened that the shift is happening at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers weren't going to come; they wrote the cities off," said
Larry Kosmont, president of Kosmont Cos., a real estate advisory and
development services firm that focuses on urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they have the technology to make those stores work for their
customers. It opens up the possibilities."</TE>

<HD>A Feast of New Traditions for Holiday</HD>
<DH>Observers in Southland head to the beach, a Hollywood
comedy club and Disneyland for unconventional Thanksgiving.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the hills and along the freeway to grandmother's house we went.
Well, some of us did. But look, this is Southern California.
Conventions were made to be broken here.</LD>
<LD>   For plenty of people, Thanksgiving was another chance to exercise
the freedom to do whatever the heck they wanted.</LD>
<LD>   On a sun-splashed beach between Ventura and Santa Barbara, holiday
revelers traded in the usual turkey-day celebrations for the white
sand and surf of an enviable California Thanksgiving.</LD>
<TE>   On the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, hundreds of people -- some
lonely, some down on their luck, some just looking for a change of
pace -- packed into a comedy club for a free meal and show.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, some people went to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   First, the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Along the Rincon Parkway in Ventura County, where the RVs and
travel trailers line up more than 100 deep, Thanksgiving Day dawned
with a strong whiff of sea salt and the heady aroma of smoked turkey
roasting over a barbecue flame.</TE>
<TE>   If there is any place that spurns the stay-at-home tradition, this
windswept stretch of coastline off the Ventura Freeway is it.</TE>
<TE>   Drawn by the crescendo of crashing waves and the majesty of diving
dolphins, some families have made it a practice to roll into this
spot year after year, convinced that Thanksgiving is a holiday best
celebrated with sun on their faces and sand between their toes.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't beat it; you couldn't pick a better place," said
Becky Grove, who along with her husband, David, was celebrating her
fifth Thanksgiving on the Rincon. "It's a perfect California
holiday."</TE>
<TE>   The Groves pulled their trailer from nearby Oak View to a motor
home space near the head of a long line of RVs, joining three other
families for the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   They roasted a turkey over the slow but steady flame of a blue
barbecue while a second couple, Brad and Kimber Wilkinson of Ojai,
dunked theirs in a deep fryer, finishing in a fraction of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "We all love to camp, we all love the beach, so why not spend
Thanksgiving here?" Kimber Wilkinson said. "It beats the
eat-'til-you're-full, sit-on-the-couch, scratch-your-belly and
watch-football-until- you-go-to-sleep thing."</TE>
<TE>   This is about as far from that world as you can get, a place where
the adults all wear shorts and T-shirts and the youngsters go
barefoot and sport bathing suits so they can splash among the waves.</TE>
<TE>   It's a place where the turkey starts getting carved even before
it's off the grill and where seagulls circle above, hoping to scoop
up off-target morsels.</TE>
<TE>   It's also an increasingly popular place for Thanksgiving, a
destination best reached days before the holiday, while the spaces
are still up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   Don and Joyce Jurgich pulled in Monday, backing their 36-foot
motor home into a roadside stall with a spectacular view of the
Channel Islands, just off the Ventura County coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not your traditional celebration, that's for sure," said
74-year-old Don Jurgich, who traveled from the couple's home state of
Washington to the Rincon for the second time in three years to spend
the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Inside their RV, in a kitchen amazingly spacious for a life spent
on the road, they prepared a 15-pound turkey with all the fixings,
which for the Jurgiches include a martini before dinner and red wine
with their meal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's laid back and relaxed," Jurgich said taking in the beach
scene. "It's not for everybody, but it's perfect for us."</TE>
<TE>   Humor on the Menu</TE>
<TE>   The Laugh Factory in Hollywood was perfect for Charley Murphy, a
disabled actor who was spending his third consecutive Thanksgiving in
a place filled with familial warmth, steaming mountains of good food,
killer comedy acts and an admission price he could afford: free.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you," he said as he walked in the door and was handed a
paper plate and utensils by club owner Jamie Masada.</TE>
<TE>   "No, thank you for coming to spend the holidays with us," said
Masada, who has been giving away holiday meals with entertainment
since 1979. Masada, who said he "enjoys this more than anything,"
beamed at Murphy, 61, who said he has been out of work since being
hit by a car in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "Your smile," said Murphy, "is worth more than the food."</TE>
<TE>   Pause, two, three.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kidding."</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it went at the Laugh Factory, where everybody's a
comic, and everybody knows that the richest humor is often born of
pain.</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard to generalize about the people who were drawn to
the club for its four seatings Thursday. There were out-of-work
actors and comedians, newcomers to Los Angeles who had no friends or
family nearby, a scattering of homeless people, and many elderly
people who live in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   There was Kurt Lehovec, a Czech-born, self-published poet who said
he intends to be famous after he dies. There was Susan Chung, a
young, aspiring actress whose family is in Philadelphia and who heard
about the Laugh Factory meal on the radio. There was Chris Ingham,
who said he does maintenance work in Santa Monica, can't afford to
visit his family in Arizona and doesn't have "a lot of friends or
places to go."</TE>
<TE>   At the Laugh Factory, Ingham said, "the food's just as good as
mom's cooking. That's all I have to say."</TE>
<TE>   Ingham's mother could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers, many from the entertainment industry, served the food
-- 100 turkeys, 100 pounds of mashed potatoes, 100 pounds of
stuffing, 100 pumpkin pies, and unspecified amounts of sweet
potatoes, cranberry sauce, salad and gravy.</TE>
<TE>   Among those serving were comedians Frazer Smith, Gerry Bednob and
Tom Dreesen. If they didn't exactly knock `em dead in the serving
line -- "You want gravy on that?" was Smith's constant one-liner --
they later doffed their aprons to perform.</TE>
<TE>   "My name is Tom Dreesen," began the frequent 'Tonight Show' guest,
"known to some of you folks as 'dark meat and gravy.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ba-boom.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the Kitchen</TE>
<TE>   And now, for something completely different.</TE>
<TE>   We mean, completely different.</TE>
<TE>   The tables were set, the turkey perfectly browned and roasted.</TE>
<TE>   There were side dishes and desserts galore: Yukon Gold mashed
potatoes, apple nut stuffing, sweet potatoes drizzled with honey.</TE>
<TE>   It must be ... Disneyland, where chef Robert Arcos and his staff
of 58 cooked for a few thousand guests at the Disneyland Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem sacrilegious to eat at a hotel restaurant on
Thanksgiving, one of America's most traditional -- and least
commercial -- holidays, a time devoted to family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Barger didn't see it that way. A noncook, Barger saw
Disneyland as a place where she could spend her holiday relaxing. At
home, she said, "You cook for two days, then you sit down to dinner,
and it's gone in 20 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Barger, 43, made the trip to Anaheim from her home in Carmel with
her family and her sister's family. "We liked this so much, we
decided to come back every other year."</TE>
<TE>   It's already a tradition for Lonnie Dorsey, 49, who lives in Los
Angeles and has been bringing her family to the hotel for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "For Californians, especially those of us who are baby boomers,
Disneyland is traditional," she said. "We grew up on all these
characters, and they have been part of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Same with Anita DeLeon of Monterey Park, who's also been bringing
her family for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This festive atmosphere here gets me in the spirit," she said.
"I'm ready to start my shopping now."</TE>

<TE>   On the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, hundreds of people -- some
lonely, some down on their luck, some just looking for a change of
pace -- packed into a comedy club for a free meal and show.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, some people went to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   First, the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Along the Rincon Parkway in Ventura County, where the RVs and
travel trailers line up more than 100 deep, Thanksgiving Day dawned
with a strong whiff of sea salt and the heady aroma of smoked turkey
roasting over a barbecue flame.</TE>
<TE>   If there is any place that spurns the stay-at-home tradition, this
windswept stretch of coastline off the Ventura Freeway is it.</TE>
<TE>   Drawn by the crescendo of crashing waves and the majesty of diving
dolphins, some families have made it a practice to roll into this
spot year after year, convinced that Thanksgiving is a holiday best
celebrated with sun on their faces and sand between their toes.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't beat it; you couldn't pick a better place," said
Becky Grove, who along with her husband, David, was celebrating her
fifth Thanksgiving on the Rincon. "It's a perfect California
holiday."</TE>
<TE>   The Groves pulled their trailer from nearby Oak View to a motor
home space near the head of a long line of RVs, joining three other
families for the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   They roasted a turkey over the slow but steady flame of a blue
barbecue while a second couple, Brad and Kimber Wilkinson of Ojai,
dunked theirs in a deep fryer, finishing in a fraction of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "We all love to camp, we all love the beach, so why not spend
Thanksgiving here?" Kimber Wilkinson said. "It beats the
eat-`til-you're-full, sit-on-the-couch,
scratch-your-belly-and-watch-football-until-you-go-to-sleep thing."</TE>
<TE>   This is about as far from that world as you can get, a place where
the adults all wear shorts and T-shirts and the youngsters go
barefoot and sport bathing suits so they can splash among the waves.</TE>
<TE>   It's a place where the turkey starts getting carved even before
it's off the grill and where seagulls circle above, hoping to scoop
up off-target morsels.</TE>
<TE>   It's also an increasingly popular place for Thanksgiving, a
destination best reached days before the holiday, while the spaces
are still up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   Don and Joyce Jurgich pulled in Monday, backing their 36-foot
motor home into a roadside stall with a spectacular view of the
Channel Islands, just off the Ventura County coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not your traditional celebration, that's for sure," said
74-year-old Don Jurgich, who traveled from the couple's home state of
Washington to the Rincon for the second time in three years to spend
the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Inside their RV, in a kitchen amazingly spacious for a life spent
on the road, they prepared a 15-pound turkey with all the fixings,
which for the Jurgiches include a martini before dinner and red wine
with their meal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's laid back and relaxed," Jurgich said taking in the beach
scene. "It's not for everybody, but it's perfect for us."</TE>
<TE>   Humor on the Menu</TE>
<TE>   The Laugh Factory in Hollywood was perfect for Charley Murphy, a
disabled actor who was spending his third consecutive Thanksgiving in
a place filled with familial warmth, steaming mountains of good food,
killer comedy acts and an admission price he could afford: free.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you," he said as he walked in the door and was handed a
paper plate and utensils by club owner Jamie Masada.</TE>
<TE>   "No, thank you for coming to spend the holidays with us," said
Masada, who has been giving away holiday meals with entertainment
since 1979. Masada, who said he "enjoys this more than anything,"
beamed at Murphy, 61, who said he has been out of work since being
hit by a car in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "Your smile," said Murphy, "is worth more than the food."</TE>
<TE>   Pause, two, three.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kidding."</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it went at the Laugh Factory, where everybody's a
comic, and everybody knows that the richest humor is often born of
pain.</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard to generalize about the people who were drawn to
the club for its four seatings Thursday. There were out-of-work
actors and comedians, newcomers to Los Angeles who had no friends or
family nearby, a scattering of homeless people, and many elderly
people who live in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   There was Kurt Lehovec, a Czech-born, self-published poet who said
he intends to be famous after he dies. There was Susan Chung, a
young, aspiring actress whose family is in Philadelphia and who heard
about the Laugh Factory meal on the radio. There was Chris Ingham,
who said he does maintenance work in Santa Monica, can't afford to
visit his family in Arizona and doesn't have "a lot of friends or
places to go."</TE>
<TE>   At the Laugh Factory, Ingham said, "the food's just as good as
mom's cooking. That's all I have to say."</TE>
<TE>   Ingham's mother could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers, many from the entertainment industry, served the food
-- 100 turkeys, 100 pounds of mashed potatoes, 100 pounds of
stuffing, 100 pumpkin pies, and unspecified amounts of sweet
potatoes, cranberry sauce, salad and gravy.</TE>
<TE>   Among those serving were comedians Frazer Smith, Gerry Bednob and
Tom Dreesen. If they didn't exactly knock `em dead in the serving
line -- "You want gravy on that?" was Smith's constant one-liner --
they later doffed their aprons to perform.</TE>
<TE>   "My name is Tom Dreesen," began the frequent Tonight Show guest,
"known to some of you folks as 'dark meat and gravy.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ba-boom.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the Kitchen</TE>
<TE>   And now, for something completely different.</TE>
<TE>   We mean, completely different.</TE>
<TE>   The tables were set, the turkey perfectly browned and roasted.
There were side dishes and desserts galore: Yukon Gold mashed
potatoes, apple nut stuffing, sweet potatoes drizzled with honey.</TE>
<TE>   It must be ... Disneyland, where chef Robert Arcos and his staff
of 58 cooked for a few thousand guests at the Disneyland Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem sacrilegious to eat at a hotel restaurant on
Thanksgiving, one of America's most traditional -- and least
commercial -- holidays, a time devoted to family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Barger didn't see it that way. A noncook, Barger saw
Disneyland as a place where she could spend her holiday relaxing. At
home, she said, "You cook for two days, then you sit down to dinner,
and it's gone in 20 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Barger, 43, made the trip to Anaheim from her home in Carmel with
her family and her sister's family. "We liked this so much, we
decided to come back every other year."</TE>
<TE>   It's already a tradition for Lonnie Dorsey, 49, who lives in Los
Angeles and has been bringing her family to the hotel for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "For Californians, especially those of us who are baby boomers,
Disneyland is traditional," she said. "We grew up on all these
characters, and they have been part of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Same with Anita DeLeon of Monterey Park, who's also been bringing
her family for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This festive atmosphere here gets me in the spirit," she said.
"I'm ready to start my shopping now."</TE>

<HD>At 93, She's Leaving Old Age in the Dust</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From the summit of Marine Street and 4th in Santa Monica, it's a
steep drop straight into the ocean and Mae Laborde, 93, is gunning
down the hill in a canary yellow 1977 Oldsmobile the size of the Love
Boat.</LD>
<LD>   I'm Mae's passenger, and I don't know if I should watch.</LD>
<LD>   The road is narrow enough as it is, but there's a truck coming up
the hill, and a car just blew a stop sign in front of us on 3rd
Street. I can't tell whether, at 4 feet 10 inches tall, Mae is
looking over or under the top of the steering wheel.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, I hate that," Mae says, calmly braking behind the car that
has just cut her off and threading a needle to squirt past the truck.
"I sure wish I had the time to write down his license number. He
didn't even stop."</TE>
<TE>   I had gone to see Mae right after an appointment with my eye
doctor. The vision is starting to go, and I figured if anyone could
advise me on negotiating L.A.'s roadways in my graying years, it
would be Mae, who got her driver's license in 1926.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, honey, I still drive three freeways," she told me.</TE>
<TE>   In my last pass through L.A., I lived on the Venice-Santa Monica
border, and Mae was my neighbor. The first time I saw her yellow car
go by, I thought it was a runaway, because I couldn't see a driver.
As it drew closer, I could see a little tuft of white hair, and then
a set of eyes, as if a cricket were driving a tank.</TE>
<TE>   The Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale has a hood the length of a
shuffleboard court and, given Mae's line of vision over the distant
grille, her focal point had to be roughly six blocks up the road. But
she handled the car like a champ, and she was no light foot either.</TE>
<TE>   Even after I moved away, Mae stayed in touch, reporting virtually
every single development in her life.</TE>
<TE>   She was selling her homegrown tomatoes to Michael's restaurant.
She was in a Sears commercial. She was on a TV program on KCET. She
won a gumbo cooking contest and was flown to New Orleans. She was on
the Santa Monica College advisory board. She was on the radio with
Mr. KABC. She went dancing at Pepperdine. Her tamale pie recipe was
featured in the L.A. Times. She graduated from the Santa Monica
Citizens Police Academy. She got an ovation at the Pageant of the
Masters in Laguna for not missing a show in 48 years.</TE>
<TE>   I always feel like a slug when I talk to Mae, who has twice my
years and three times my drive. I don't know a better time than
Thanksgiving week to tell you about her, because no one is more
thankful to wake up each day and hit the gas.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel an age gap between us," says Judy Lee, Mae's
47-year-old neighbor and pal. A couple of years ago, Mae told Lee she
ought to check out this Ricky Martin character.</TE>
<TE>   "I really dig him," Mae said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   She used the word dig? I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes. She said dig."</TE>
<TE>   Lee, an advisor to international students at Pepperdine
University, often takes Mae to school weddings and social functions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no keeping her off the dance floor," says Lee. "At a
recent wedding, the whole room lit up when she started making eyes at
the deejay and using her finger to lure him onto the floor to dance
with her. He looked like he was in his 20s."</TE>
<TE>   When I called Mae about my eye problem, I wasn't sure she'd be
able to squeeze me in. She agreed to give me a Driving for Seniors
lesson on two conditions:</TE>
<TE>   First, she wanted to read my tea leaves again. (Mae cranks up the
yellow bomber and goes barreling all over Los Angeles, fortunetelling
for a growing number of devotees. When she read my leaves this time,
she saw a plane trip in the very near future, and I was on a plane
within a week.)</TE>
<TE>   Second, the column couldn't be exclusively about driving. Mae
wanted her life story in print.</TE>
<TE>   It's like dealing with a rock star.</TE>
<TE>   Mae moved south from Fresno as a young girl and got a job at the
Kress store in downtown L.A. After work, she'd hop aboard a Red Car
for the ride back to her aunt's home in Venice, and a conductor would
flirt with her. Mae married Nicholas Laborde and they had a daughter
who died in her 40s. Mae lost her husband a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   "I eat a very nutritious diet and I think positive thoughts," says
Mae, who worked as a secretary for Lawrence Welk for several years,
which explains the dancing bug. "And I don't drink or smoke, honey.
Make sure you get that in there somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Back behind the wheel, Mae is cruising Santa Monica in the Delta
88. Throw a bouquet of flowers on the hood, and we could be a float
in the Rose Parade. With her eyes barely skimming the top of the dash
and my head scraping the ceiling, we're getting stares from other
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   She's my driving instructor, I want to tell them. You got a
problem?</TE>
<TE>   "You have to drive more defensively as you get older," Mae
advises, saying I should assume that everyone else on the road is a
maniac. "It's a speedway out here, and people don't even look where
they're</TE>
<TE>   going."</TE>
<TE>   I ask Mae to drive me to Michael's on 3rd Street, so I can check
out her tomato story. She double-parks the Delta 88 and I run inside,
where general manager Mark Goldfarb greets me.</TE>
<TE>   "They're high-octane tomatoes," he says. "We use them in our
gazpacho, our appetizers, the heirloom tomato salad. You mean she's
out there now? She's her own little PR machine."</TE>
<TE>   Goldfarb dashes out to say hello to "our little celebrity." Mae
smiles, then hits the gas.</TE>
<TE>   On Wilshire, she sees someone exiting a parked car half a block
away.</TE>
<TE>   "You see that leg coming out?" she asks, applying the brakes.</TE>
<TE>   If there's a center lane, Mae advises, take it. That gives you a
little more maneuverability, especially on the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Mae if she's caused an accident in 77 years of driving.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, honey," she says. "I never even hit a bird."</TE>
<TE>   The heck with driving in my old age. I may just hire Mae as my
chauffeur.</TE>

<HD>Parker Center a Regular City Code Violator</HD>
<DH>A city consultant says the police headquarters needs fire
safety improvements, seismic retrofitting and other basic
maintenance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 14 years since Los Angeles first required fire sprinklers in
high-rise buildings, its police headquarters has repeatedly been
cited for failing to abide by that law, city records show.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor and City Council have repeatedly put off paying for
mandated improvements.</LD>
<LD>   During the same period, the owners of more than 380 privately
owned high-rise buildings have been forced to spend millions of
dollars to install sprinklers and alarms, or to vacate portions of
their buildings under threat of being fined.</LD>
<TE>   No fines have been levied against the city General Services
Department, which is responsible for maintaining the 47-year-old
Parker Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a double standard," said Mitzi Grasso, director of the union
representing 9,000 LAPD officers. "We've been very angry regarding
this issue. We feel our members deserve a safe working environment,
and the city has neglected Parker Center."</TE>
<TE>   Dick Welles, chairman-elect of the Building Owners and Managers
Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, agreed. "If a requirement is good for
the private sector, it should be good for government as well," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   One city consultant found that in addition to fire safety
improvements, the center needs seismic retrofitting, roof repairs,
plumbing repairs and other basic maintenance. The building has
repeatedly been cited for boxes and other material placed in front of
exits and in stairwells. It is a symptom of the fact that the
department has outgrown the building.</TE>
<TE>   After numerous citations for safety violations, city officials are
only now beginning to seriously consider moving the 1,200 police
employees out of the eight-story building and tearing it down.</TE>
<TE>   Grasso credits the Los Angeles Police Commission for forcing the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   After taking care of other priorities including reforms in
response to the Rampart scandal and hiring a new police chief, the
panel headed by commission President Rick Caruso voted this week to
begin efforts to vacate the structure.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't understand how this has gone on this long," Caruso said.
"The irony is you have people who you are asking to protect the
public and you have housed them in one of the most dangerous
buildings downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso blamed the problem on a lack of political will by city
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "It never was important to anybody because you cannot garner any
votes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Caruso said that Mayor James K. Hahn, who served for more
than a decade as city attorney before winning election last year, has
backed the commission in its efforts to find a replacement for Parker
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook confirmed that Hahn supports swift
action.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always just a matter of priorities. The city has had
different priorities in recent years, from paving more streets to
putting more police officers in the field," Middlebrook said. "But
that facility has gotten so bad that we have come to a point where we
need to act."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso's agitating has ruffled the feathers of some council
members who have asked for thoughtful study before going ahead with
replacement of Parker Center because of its price tag of $150
million.</TE>
<TE>   And one councilman, Nate Holden, says the city should focus on
other priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I for one will not put a building in front of the need to provide
additional police officers," he said earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   The building, opened in 1955, was named after former Police Chief
William H. Parker, who died in 1966. It is home to the current police
chief, much of the LAPD administration, as well as several
specialized units, including the Robbery-Homicide Division
detectives.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council adopted a high-rise retrofit ordinance in 1988
after a fire that May in the first Interstate Bank skyscraper killed
one person and injured 40 others.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance required buildings taller than 75 feet to install
fire safety systems, including sprinklers.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department first cited Parker Center for noncompliance
with the retrofit ordinance on Nov. 10, 1990, records show.</TE>
<TE>   City elected officials were reminded of the problem in 1996, when
consultant Kosmont Associates issued a city-commissioned report that
recommended the replacement of Parker Center, in part because of the
fire safety violations.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department issued other written citations and complaint
letters over the years, including one in March 2000 in which 61
violations were cited, including several for boxes blocking exits.</TE>
<TE>   "This building does not comply with the current fire and life
safety codes ... in the state of California nor the city of Los
Angeles," the citation adds. "It has no fire alarm system except in
the property room in the basement. It also has no sprinkler system,
again except in the property room in the basement."</TE>
<TE>   The citation went on to castigate city officials for failing to
address the problem of blocked exits.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to the above is the apparent and total disregard for
the maintenance of clear and adequate exit corridors, aisleways, and
stairwells for the escape of personnel to safety in case of an
emergency," the citation said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in a letter to General Services Department head Jon
Mukri, Deputy Fire Chief Jimmy Hill again called for action.</TE>
<TE>   "The lack of an approved fire warning system, fire sprinkler
system, emergency lighting, and elevator lobbies exposes the city to
financial loss if a civilian with police business or a city employee
should be injured or death occurs as a result of known deficiencies,"
Hill wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The fire marshal said in an interview that fines and vacation
orders were never issued, although his department made the city
attorney's office aware of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after Hill's letter, Mukri wrote to City Administrative
Officer William Fujioka, asking that $12.5 million be put in the
budget for installing the fire safety system.</TE>
<TE>   Mukri wrote that the money was needed to bring the project into
compliance and avoid "significant liability."</TE>
<TE>   The money, however, was not provided.</TE>
<TE>   That is largely because the Kosmont report concluded that it would
be more cost effective to replace Parker Center than to renovate it.
However, the same city officials have not been able to come up with
funding to replace the structure.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council made one attempt to pass a bond measure in 1999
to pay to replace Parker Center, but it did not win voter approval.
The council decided not to include Parker Center in a police bond
measure that passed last year. In the meantime, requests for money to
retrofit the building went nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso believes this time will be different. He has turned up the
heat on the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "If this had been a private building, it would have been closed
and vacated by now," Caruso said.</TE>

<HD>He Marches Right Up and Gives Them a Flu Shot</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Boo-hoo-hoo!" cries the president of the Tournament of Roses,
steeling himself for the needle of Dr. Ray George.</LD>
<LD>   Soon, the flu vaccine has been delivered into the left shoulder of
Gary Thomas, and he can relax.</LD>
<LD>   "Ray," Thomas says, "you've hit this arm so many times you've got
a target drawn on the side."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed he does. George, 75, is the semiofficial physician to the
Rose Parade, one of the most widely watched spectacles on Earth.The
parade has two ironclad rules that would seem to contradict the laws
of the universe.</TE>
<TE>   * There will be no rain. (One parade executive is appointed "the
weatherman" each year to ensure it.)</TE>
<TE>   * No parade volunteer is allowed to be sick.</TE>
<TE>   George enforces the second rule with a striking single-mindedness.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Arkansas, George moved west with his parents, who worked
as bookbinders, before he was 2. He went through the Pasadena
schools, joined the Navy and served in the Pacific in World War II.
He graduated from Pomona College and USC Medical School and
eventually joined the staff of Huntington Hospital, where he was an
internist for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, he was admitted to the Tournament of Roses. At first, he
was just another volunteer in a white suit. But in the early 1970s,
three of the Rose Parade princesses caught the flu. They were too
sick to attend the coronation of the queen.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Parade's director of public relations asked George if he
could prevent such catastrophes in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, George administered flu shots to the entire court.
A few years later, he began injecting the parade's small staff of
employees, as well as the entire committee of volunteers that
oversees the court.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 15 years, George has offered flu shots to all parade
volunteers and staff. To do so, he has had to secure large amounts of
vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Some years, he managed to order early enough to get all he needed.
In years when the vaccine was scarce, the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services helped out. (Dr. Alvin Nelson-El Amin,
medical director for the county immunization program, says flu shots
are appropriate for anyone who works with large crowds.)</TE>
<TE>   Parade volunteers don't pay for the shots. For the last three
years, the Tournament of Roses has picked up the tab; before that,
George and other donors covered the cost.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament so values George that he has been made an "honorary
director," allowing him to continue his parade work beyond the usual
retirement age of 65.</TE>
<TE>   "We're grateful for Ray, even when he scolds us," says Bill Flinn,
the tournament's chief operating officer. "My first year working
here, I got so sick I couldn't function. So I never miss a shot."</TE>
<TE>   At this time of year, George is a fixture at tournament
headquarters on Orange Grove Boulevard, proselytizing like a flu shot
missionary. He will approach grand marshals, visiting band directors,
even reporters, and offer to "stick" them.</TE>
<TE>   On two days each fall, the doctor, aided by his wife, Carol, holds
forth in the tournament conference room, inoculating hundreds of
volunteers -- he's done more than 300 of the 935 volunteers so far
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   He sets aside other days to travel to the float building
companies, where he vaccinates employees and some volunteer
decorators. He will administer shots up until a week before the
parade.</TE>
<TE>   This year, California Highway Patrol officers assigned to parade
duty agreed to submit to the doctor's needle for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   George will even go to the homes of parade officials if asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a certain passion for flu shots," he says. "One year, the
IRS started asking me questions. They couldn't believe I made that
many house calls."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, George has earned a national reputation as a
doctor to big events. For the last 11 years, the National Football
League has employed him to monitor the health of security and
transportation personnel at the Super Bowl. He did similar duty for
the 1994 World Cup held at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   George's work extends beyond the medical. He serves as right-hand
man to Jim Stivers, a legendary behind-the-scenes organizer in
Pasadena who is the official liaison between the Tournament of Roses
and the city government.</TE>
<TE>   "Ray was my personal doctor for a number of years," Stivers says.
"He is a quiet and sensitive guy who is just very fond of people and
the parade. And he's tough enough to have given John Wayne a shot"
when the late actor served as grand marshal.</TE>
<TE>   During the months before the parade, Stivers and George oversee
early Thursday morning meetings to iron out details of the parade,
everything from the handling of horses to security measures.</TE>
<TE>   George draws all the parade's maps -- detailing locations of
everything from grandstands to portable commodes -- and often
displays a deep and eclectic knowledge of the event. He recently
warned against painting a red rose on the pavement because horses,
which are colorblind, might mistake it for a gaping hole in the
ground and rear up.</TE>
<TE>   At one recent meeting, George was asked for an update on his
medical activities.</TE>
<TE>   "I just finished sticking the Pasadena police and fire [fighters]
with their flu shots," he reported. "Pretty soon, I will have stuck
them all."</TE>

<HD>Think of Holiday Feast as Thrill Ride</HD>
<DH>Growing popularity of Disneyland Hotel's annual spread
reflects the evolution of a homebound holiday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino, Dave McKibben and Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tables were set, the turkey perfectly browned and roasted. There
were side dishes and desserts galore: Yukon Gold mashed potatoes,
apple nut stuffing, sweet potatoes drizzled with honey.</LD>
<LD>   Just like Grandma used to make.</LD>
<LD>   Only this Thanksgiving feast wasn't prepared by relatives. And it
was far, far away from Grandma's house.</LD>
<TE>   This meal was the creation of chef Robert Arcos and his staff of
58 cooks at the Disneyland Hotel, one of many places where a growing
number of Southern California residents opted to dine out on
Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   To some, it might seem sacrilegious to eat at a hotel on
Thanksgiving, one of America's most traditional -- and least
commercial -- holidays. Especially in a cavernous ballroom that seats
1,400 diners, with Snow White, Minnie Mouse and Alice a quick photo
opportunity away.</TE>
<TE>   Lonnie Dorsey, 49, of Los Angeles didn't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "For Californians, especially those of us who are baby boomers,
Disneyland is traditional," she said before digging in. "We grew up
on all these characters, and they have been part of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Peggy and Mike Nath, from Paradise, Utah, stumbled across an
invitation to the feast on the Internet while researching activities
for their trip. They came with son Steven, 4, who happily munched on
crab legs while wearing an elaborate wizard hat with blinking gold
lights. Their favorite dish? "Where do you start?" Peggy Nath said
with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   As tourists, they were in the minority Thursday. Most of the crowd
-- about 70% -- were locals, Disney spokesman John McClintock said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the nation's demographics and changing values, it's not at
all surprising that families would stray from a homebound holiday,
said anthropologist Sidney Mintz, author of "Tasting Food, Tasting
Freedom," who has studied eating habits and culture.</TE>
<TE>   "You bet Thanksgiving's changed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, America's a melting pot. Immigrants bring their own
tastes and preferences or abandon the concept of turkey altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't feel any longer that they've got to cleave to the
notion of Native American food or that we're all supposed to be
giving thanks the way the Pilgrims did," Mintz said. "That's all out
the door. You can have turkey sushi now if you want."</TE>
<TE>   Savvy Disney cooks clearly had their disparate diners in mind.
Next to heaping trays of stuffing, juicy fowl and thick cranberry
sauce were crab legs, mounds of shrimp, lobster cakes with citrus
beurre blanc sauce and sculpted chocolate confections. At the
children's buffet were thick-cut fries, tiny pepperoni pizzas,
chicken nuggets and Goofyroni and cheese. Design-it-yourself sundaes
came with vanilla, strawberry and chocolate Haagen-Dazs.</TE>
<TE>   Each table displayed a "Disney Family Thanksgiving Feast 2002"
wine list.</TE>
<TE>   Having alternatives -- and the luxury to afford them -- is a
significant factor contributing to the evolution of Thanksgiving
traditions, Mintz said. "One of the ways to feel luxurious, to feel
festive, is to eat out."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is another, more practical matter: Women, who
have traditionally been the primary cooks, may not know how to baste
a turkey, bake an apple pie or whip up marshmallow yams. Or want
to.Plus, the prime attraction for many on Thursday was even simpler:
not having to clean up afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I'd be cooking if I was home," said Pam Wilcox, who arrived
with husband Mike and sons Curtis, 13, and Michael, 11, from Selah,
Wash., a little town outside Yakima. "We did this two years ago, and
we just decided to do it again. The kids love Disneyland, and every
once in a while I need to take a year off."</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Morrill, professor and chairman of the sociology department
at UC Irvine, offered one more possibility. With blended families,
in-laws and ex-spouses, hosting a huge Thanksgiving gathering with
everyone hanging around the living room all day "may make it a
difficult go in terms of conflict management," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be easier to take it out of the home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So then, where better than "The Happiest Place on Earth"?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the Thanksgiving tradition in a conventional sense, but
there is so much Disney tradition that people are wrapped up in,"
spokesman McClintock said. "Spending Thanksgiving with Chip and Dale
is probably as much as like spending it with family for some of
them."</TE>
<TE>   There was some griping about the cost: $52 per adult and $13.50
per child. But there were no complaints about the spread. A team of
chefs worked 10-hour shifts leading up to Turkey Day; on Thursday
morning, they began before dawn.</TE>
<TE>   The grocery list to last the day? It was hefty: 120 28-pound
turkeys, 700 pounds of shrimp, 1,000 pounds of prime rib, 400 pounds
of halibut, 1,000 pounds of potatoes and 14,000 servings of dessert.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpieces alone -- sumptuous cornucopias made with brushed
chocolate -- measured 7 feet tall and 10 feet long, said Carlos
Acosta, Disney's operations manager for resort banquets and special
events.</TE>
<TE>   Among those enjoying the spectacle was worker Sly Smith, clad in a
starched white dinner shirt tagged with a special Disney pin --
featuring Mickey and Minnie in Pilgrim outfits -- given to each
employee. Diners were identified by the large Chip and Dale buttons
given to each as souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone just seems to be happy," said Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Acosta said people leave the ballroom every year telling him that
the Disneyland Hotel's dinner is a well-kept secret, yet every year
more and more people show up.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the hotel had reservations for 3,000 meals, double the
number of a few years ago. There were also 300 walk-ins.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear that families are still spending quality time
together, he said. They're simply forging new traditions. For
example, reservations in the past featured smaller groups of four to
six. But those small groups would tell their neighbors, friends and
extended family. Reservations this year included many parties of 10
or more.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is not eating in or eating out, UCI's Morrill said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the number of flight reservations and the crush at
airports, the single most traveled day is still the day before
Thanksgiving. It's clear people are traveling to see other people.
It's the gathering of people together, whether it be in a home or in
a restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   For Anita DeLeon of Monterey Park, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck
are the perfect segue to Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "I got excited in the car just driving over here," said DeLeon,
who has been bringing the family to the hotel's Thanksgiving feed for
10 years. "I'm ready to start my shopping now."</TE>

<HD>The Sky's the Limit With New Zoning</HD>
<DH>New L.A. ordinances allow developers to build more housing
above shops, in commercial areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jocelyn Y. Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Above the city's busiest commercial corridors is a vast and empty
skyscape that Jane Blumenfeld has eyed for years now.</LD>
<LD>   Blumenfeld, a Los Angeles city planner, visualizes that emptiness
filled with residents who live above the corridors, perhaps patronize
the shops below and commute on buses or subways that serve the
streets.</LD>
<LD>   Now, a new ordinance, part of a package approved by the Los
Angeles City Council this week, will make it easier to build housing
above retail buildings or to build housing-only projects on
commercial streets.</LD>
<TE>   The package is "a new tool that is really going to be meaningful
and able to produce housing," Blumenfeld said. "If you think of all
those corridors -- especially Pico, Olympic, Exposition -- they're
wide and one story. What these [ordinances] are trying to do is get
the potential that's there to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The ordinances, approved Tuesday, are the result of a report
released two years ago by the Los Angeles Housing Crisis Task Force.
The document recommended that the Planning Department examine whether
city codes impede housing production.</TE>
<TE>   By right, developers were already allowed to build housing in
commercial zones.</TE>
<TE>   But such projects were rare because, under the old system,
builders had to apply for variances -- special permits that allowed
them to build outside certain specifications governing square
footage, building height or how far the structure had to be set back
from the street. The process required hearings and could take months,
but generally the projects were well-received in their neighborhoods,
Blumenfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of the new mixed-use zones, which would apply only to
commercial areas, allows for such projects to be built without such
permits. In addition to retail businesses, the zones allow for
child-care centers and other neighborhood services on ground floors.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Ed Reyes, author of the rezoning ordinance, said the
new zones will bring relief to residents living two or three families
to an apartment. They will also add to the city's coffers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A real byproduct is stimulating our tax base," Reyes said. "How
are we going to pay for 18,000 [police] officers when we now have
9,000?"</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the new zones include a list of housing-related
organizations and tenants groups, as well as developers who view the
zones as a way to increase the city's housing stock.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is to decide which areas will be rezoned. That
determination will be made on a lot-by-lot or block-by-block basis,
Blumenfeld said. Property owners, developers, council offices and the
city Planning Commission may propose rezoning. A series of public
hearings, environmental review and analysis would follow.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's voices will be heard before anything is rezoned,"
Blumenfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of some communities already seem poised to object. At a
hearing held months before passage of the ordinance, some spoke
against the new zones, fearing clogged streets and other problems
associated with growth.</TE>
<TE>   Although concerns exist in some neighborhoods, residents of areas
plagued by overcrowding may welcome the change, Reyes said. The city
averages 12 to 14 residents per acre, but in the southern end of his
district the average is 147 people per acre, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go where [the rezoning is] most easily implemented
because the need is so great," he said. "We are in a crisis. It's a
tale of two cities."</TE>
<TE>   The ideal place for such a zone would be near light- or heavy-rail
stations or major intersections served by bus lines, he said.
Theoretically, the zones will help relieve congestion and promote the
use of public transportation, perhaps revitalizing blighted streets
in the process.</TE>
<TE>   For a city that has long prided itself on its neighborhoods of
single-family homes -- and protected them -- focusing growth in
commercial areas is a good way to meet the housing needs of an
exploding population, Blumenfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have miles of these corridors all over the place," she said.
"We have so much capacity. We can deal with the amount of new people
if we do this."</TE>
<TE>   After the ordinance goes into effect next month, the Planning
Department will offer a workshop to explain the zoning to developers,
lenders, architects and others.</TE>
<TE>   Also this week, the City Council approved three other
housing-related ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   * One increases density bonuses for builders of housing near rail
stations, major bus stops, commercial centers or universities. Under
state law, developers are allowed to build more housing units in
exchange for designating a certain percentage of them affordable.
Under the new city ordinance, that rate increases from 25% to 35% in
targeted locations.</TE>
<TE>   * Another ordinance allows applications for density bonuses
greater than 25%, increasing the potential for bonuses to more
projects.</TE>
<TE>   * The third eliminates a provision that had discouraged developers
from building more three- to five-bedroom apartments, needed for
large families.</TE>

<HD>Army Holds Its Ground in Battle With Rumsfeld</HD>
<DH>A light-armor program is spared, but the service's role in
modern warfare remains an issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army's chief of staff, is helping to direct a
low-intensity war in Afghanistan and preparing for a possible
invasion of Iraq. But his most formidable adversary these days is on
the third floor of the Pentagon: Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld.</LD>
<LD>   In the last year, Rumsfeld cut Army weapon programs and relegated
the nation's oldest armed service to a supporting role in war plans
for Afghanistan and Iraq. His moves left Army brass struggling to
regain the service's traditional dominance -- and funding -- in the
new war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Army has finally won one. Sources say Rumsfeld will spare
from planned budget cuts a light-armor program that Shinseki says is
critical for remaking the Army into the more high-tech, faster-moving
strike force that the Defense secretary is demanding.</LD>
<TE>   The fight over the multibillion-dollar Stryker program gives
insight into the powerful clash of philosophies and wills sparring
inside the nation's defense establishment as the world's only
superpower decides how it should best defend itself against future
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   In saving Stryker, the Army -- after suffering one rejection after
another -- gained both the sense that it can reach common ground with
Rumsfeld and that it can control its fate as it works to reposition
itself closer to the center of U.S. war plans for the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Shinseki came up with the idea for revamping six existing Army
brigades as Stryker brigades even before Rumsfeld ordered the
military to remake itself for the global war on terrorism. Shinseki
envisioned six brigades of 3,500 men each, outfitted with fast-moving
wheeled troop carriers, heavy weaponry and high-tech communication
equipment. They would deploy anywhere on the globe within four days
and fight smart when they got there.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was to turn out the first brigade by May 2003, then one a
year through 2008. Named for two Medal of Honor winners, the brigades
would provide a medium-weight force of troops who would move to
battle faster than they can in tanks, and arrive with heavier weapons
and greater protection than light infantry.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, Army tanks would simply run into the enemy and
start firing. With the Stryker, small unmanned planes flying overhead
give an instant picture of the battlefield day or night, allowing
soldiers to fire on the enemy before being spotted.</TE>
<TE>   The lightly armored Stryker personnel carriers look like a cross
between a Humvee and a tank and allow groups of 11 men to reach
remote areas in rough terrain at more than 50 mph. A cannon mounted
on top of the Stryker can be fired remotely, sparing soldiers
exposure to enemy fire.</TE>
<TE>   Each planned brigade is expected to cost about $1.5 billion, and
will be equipped with 309 Stryker vehicles, at a cost of $1.5 million
to $3.5 million each.</TE>
<TE>   It all seemed tailor-made to Rumsfeld's vision of a leaner,
lighter war machine for the challenges of the global war on terrorism
-- and it was scheduled to begin deploying in time to help with a
possible mission in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But to Shinseki's dismay, Rumsfeld's budget aides this fall said
they were considering slashing the planned six brigades to three. The
proposal was seen as a vote of no-confidence not only in Stryker, but
in the army's efforts to modernize.</TE>
<TE>   Without Stryker, Army officials fretted, they would be unable to
fulfill the mission Rumsfeld had laid out for them.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to preserve Stryker, the Army launched a bureaucratic
and public relations war aimed at breaking its string of losing
battles with Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Shinseki and Army Secretary Thomas E. White, the service's top
civilian leader, began a charm offensive to persuade Rumsfeld's
Pentagon that Stryker was exactly the sort of innovative program they
were looking for from the Army. And they argued that the military
needed the technology-laden Stryker troop carriers in Afghanistan
and, possibly, Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, both Rumsfeld and budget aide Stephen A. Cambone say
the final decision on Stryker will be made in the next few weeks. And
sources in Rumsfeld's office cautioned there are still questions that
must be answered.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for the Army to come back with a plan that will
make this more of a fighting force than they now have," said a senior
defense official familiar with the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   But industry, Army and other defense officials said this week they
have strong indications that the program will be spared. The 2004
defense budget Rumsfeld is to send to the White House next month will
include some strings, but the program will be kept intact.</TE>
<TE>   The gap between the Army and its civilian leader has been largely
philosophical.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld, a former Navy aviator, has presented a clear, if
controversial, vision of modern warfare, one that uses fewer
infantrymen and relies more on precision airstrikes and on small
groups of special operation soldiers. He has sought cuts to fund an
elaborate missile-defense system, unmanned planes and
satellite-guided bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Army leaders, who still insist that some military engagements will
require large ground battles, have grown increasingly alarmed about
what role their service plays in Rumsfeld's vision.</TE>
<TE>   "My impression is that Rumsfeld is looking to fight wars without
armies," said Ivo Daalder, a former National Security Council
official and military analyst with the Brookings Institution, a
Washington, D.C., think tank. "His philosophy is that you can now
fight wars without blood, that you can do it from on high, that you
can destroy targets -- without actually having to get mud on their
boots. But in the end, you achieve your objective by having boots on
the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Shinseki and Rumsfeld seemed natural allies in
modernizing the Army. Shinseki became the father of military
transformation in 1999 when he ordered the Army to become faster and
lighter. A year later, after Rumsfeld returned for a second stint as
Defense secretary, he ordered all four services to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Yet having the idea first did not seem to help Shinseki with his
new boss.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld quickly served notice that the Army had to work harder to
re-create itself. He started by killing the Army's Crusader artillery
system, criticized as too heavy and too oriented toward Cold
War-style conflicts. Then he cut the Army's Comanche helicopter
program nearly in half. The secretary then seemed to undermine
Shinseki by announcing his replacement -- his deputy, Gen. John Keane
-- 15 months before Shinseki's retirement. Shinseki reportedly first
read the news in the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Shinseki and Rumsfeld's offices have played down the conflict and
called negotiations over the Stryker program "amiable." Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz, when asked by an interviewer
whether Rumsfeld is anti-Army, replied tersely: "Definitely not.
That's a simple question to answer."</TE>
<TE>   Army officials say they improved tense relations with Rumsfeld and
his civilian leaders by showing how Stryker could be ready for battle
soon -- and by changing their tactics.</TE>
<TE>   With Crusader, the Army largely ignored Rumsfeld and tried to save
the program by lobbying Congress. With Stryker, one Army official
involved in the campaign to save the program said, "We did exactly
the opposite of what we did with Crusader."</TE>
<TE>   Shinseki took the unusual step of hiring two public relations
firms to make the Army's case. At one point, the Army called a news
conference to demonstrate that critics were wrong when they said
Stryker couldn't fit into a C-130 cargo plane. As reporters watched,
one of the vehicles was driven into the giant plane's hold.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to highlight the brigades' usefulness to Pentagon planners,
Army strategists used the units -- which will not be certified as fit
for duty until May -- in a mock postwar cleanup mission last week at
the former George Air Force Base in Victorville. Soldiers were
patrolling the fictional nation of Pacifica, based roughly on the
Philippine island of Luzon, after an invasion by fictional neighbor
Surran. On a mission to halt infiltration by guerrillas and to
buttress the tottering Pacifica regime, they sought to make allies of
local officials.</TE>
<TE>   Each group entered Pacifica in Strykers with operators viewing an
infrared computer screen that revealed a moonless predawn landscape
as if it were twilight. If a drone or Stryker operator identifies an
enemy, a red diamond appears instantly on computer screens in every
vehicle and command post, giving an instantaneous picture to platoon
leaders on foot who otherwise would rely on radios and hand-marked
maps.</TE>
<TE>   Stryker advocates hope that if the first brigade is not ready in
time for a possible war with Iraq, it could help stabilize the region
in its aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "The best selling point for this brigade is the utilization of it.
We've got to get it out there," said Lt. Col. Jim Cashwell, a
battalion commander who oversaw the exercise. "The question is,
where?"</TE>

<HD>Taking Up the Cause of High Fees</HD>

<DL>EDISON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>When the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs wanted to
raise money two years ago, it hired Civic Development Group, one of
the nation's largest police and fire telemarketers. The company
raised $1.3 million for the police group -- but kept more than $1
million as fees and expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Across the country, professional fund-raisers bring in an
estimated $1 billion per year from similar relationships with
nonprofit organizations, most of it from telemarketing, with some
returning as little as 10% of the take to the charities.</LD>
<LD>   State attorneys general and charity regulators say that
fund-raising campaigns with high expenses are fraudulent and
misleading, because consumers believe most of the money they donate
will go to the nonprofits.</LD>
<TE>   Courts have not always agreed. But this month, the Supreme Court
said it will decide an Illinois case where high-fee fund-raising was
prosecuted as common fraud.</TE>
<TE>   State regulators, who have questioned high-expense fund-raising
for years, say an opinion in their favor could mean a reduction in
fraud and an increase in the amount of money going to charities. Some
states -- among them California, Ohio, Massachusetts, New York,
Vermont, North Carolina and South Carolina -- issue annual reports
for consumers that track how much money professional fund-raisers in
their states keep, and how much goes to the charities.</TE>
<TE>   "If the majority of the money is not going to the charity, that is
fraud," Utah Atty. Gen. Mark Shurtleff said.</TE>
<TE>   But professional fund-raisers and their clients say that expensive
campaigns are the only way for many nonprofits to raise money,
particularly if the cause is less well-known or perceived as less
popular. They say that 10% or 20% of $1 million is better than
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of decisions in the 1980s, the U.S. Supreme Court
found that restricting fees would not reduce fraud and agreed that
some charities, by necessity, have higher fund-raising expenses. The
court also said that limiting or defining allowable expense ratios
restricted the freedom of speech of the nonprofit groups, and
ordering the disclosure of fund-raising expenses was
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The case before the Supreme Court pits the attorneys general of
Illinois and other states against Telemarketing Associates Inc., an
Illinois company whose client, a Vietnam veterans group, received
only 15% of the money raised in its name.</TE>
<TE>   The California attorney general's office is considering filing a
friend-of-the-court brief in the case. Florida and other states are
already writing their briefs, which are due in December.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking carefully at the fact that the court has taken
this case," said Tom Dresslar, spokesman for California Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer's office. "Our concern overall is that donors are
adequately informed about how their money is going to be spent."</TE>
<TE>   California named 127 fund-raisers in its most recent list of
telemarketers that keep at least 85% of the money they raise,
including 10 associated with CDG. "Historically, on average, less
than one-half of the dollars collected by commercial fund-raisers in
California have actually gone to charities," the attorney general
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd Perkins, chief of the Illinois charitable trusts bureau,
said a court victory could strengthen the negotiating position of
nonprofit clients and mean more money for charities.</TE>
<TE>   But Errol Copilevitz, who said he will argue the case for
Telemarketing Associates and is Civic Development Group's outside
counsel, disagreed: "There will be fewer charities, fewer
opportunities for these groups to have their voices heard."</TE>
<TE>   Illinois' position "has huge implications across the board," said
Copilevitz, a leading industry lawyer. If the state wins, it will be
up to regulators to decide what fund-raising expenses are acceptable,
and which would have a "chilling effect" on the nonprofits' free
speech and their ability to raise money.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers are often surprised when they discover how much of their
donations never make it to a charity or police and fire fraternal
organization. A 2001 study by the Better Business Bureau's Wise
Giving Alliance found that 97% of those surveyed thought that
charities should receive 50% or more of the money raised in their
names.</TE>
<TE>   Wise Giving and the American Institute of Philanthropy say that
fund-raising costs for charities should never exceed 35% of the
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "As a nonprofit, you kind of get caught up in it," said Charles
McLain, chief executive of the California Veterans Advocacy Corp.,
which recently switched from a large commercial fund-raiser to an
in-house group.</TE>
<TE>   A close look at CDG, one of the country's leading telemarketing
firms, shows how fund-raisers targeted by the Supreme Court case
work, why regulators have had trouble stopping them and why
nonprofits continue to hire them.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last eight years, New Jersey-based Civic Development, its
parent group CDG Management and related companies have collected more
than $291 million for charity, police and fire causes nationwide, and
kept all but $49 million, according to state reports.</TE>
<TE>   CDG has used 28 names since 1992 to solicit money, but all the
firms are tied back to the same for-profit company in New Jersey,
according to the Federal Trade Commission.</TE>
<TE>   CDG has been repeatedly accused of false and deceptive
fund-raising. It is operating under special conditions imposed by
state regulators in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Idaho and
New Jersey. It has run afoul of regulators in at least 18 states and
the FTC in the last 15 years, paying more than $1 million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials declined to be interviewed and referred all
questions to their attorney. Copilevitz said that "virtually every
organization that raises money for public safety groups has been the
subject of regulatory scrutiny at one time or another."</TE>
<TE>   "CDG has been able to resolve its regulatory problems in a
positive manner, which has made the company bigger, stronger and more
effective."</TE>
<TE>   CDG, based in an office park in northern New Jersey, employs about
5,500 solicitors in 35 call centers in 11 states across the eastern
half of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Some CDG contracts guarantee nonprofit clients as much as $400,000
a year. Others guarantee a percentage of all funds raised -- 10% to
20% to the client with the rest going to CDG.</TE>
<TE>   CDG's expense filings in Georgia and Florida, where more detailed
records were available, report 40% of the total money raised paid for
the telemarketer's employees' salaries. Almost 20% more went to phone
charges and mail processing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite warnings from regulators -- trade commission attorneys
said in 1997 that the CDG played "on people's law enforcement
sympathies for profit" -- the firm and its affiliates still represent
most of the nation's state fraternal orders of police.</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of Police and Sheriffs was among a dozen
California nonprofits -- half of them police-related -- that have
used CDG and related companies to solicit millions of dollars over
the phone in recent years. Of $5.8 million collected from 1999 to
2001, the groups received $939,000, state records show.</TE>
<TE>   The groups that hire CDG see it as a win-win deal. Even if CDG
keeps the bulk of the money it raises, the police still end up with
more money than they would have gotten otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The New York State Fraternal Order of Police raised just $300,000
before signing with CDG in 1994. But since then, CDG has raised more
than $25 million in the group's name. The FOP's share has been more
than $7.3 million -- enough to support salaries for the group's
officers, scholarships and contributions to other police groups.</TE>
<TE>   CDG, however, has had its share of problems. It paid a $125,000
fine to New Jersey regulators in 1999 after authorities alleged that
it made false claims that it was raising money for local police.
State officials said that of the $8.6 million raised for the State
Law Enforcement Officers Assn. over six years, "almost nothing" went
to law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   CDG nearly had conflicts with charity regulators after last year's
terrorist attacks. On the morning of Sept. 14, 2001, CDG readied a
special script for the FOP that spoke of an "emergency relief fund"
set up to "assist the families of the police officers who gave their
lives in the World Trade Center disaster."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign was pulled in minutes, after New York Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani warned consumers against Sept. 11-related telemarketing
and threatened telemarketers with arrest.</TE>

<TE>   Line: Texas by 13.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M update: Aggie players will wear Brandon Fails' No. 89 on
their helmets in memory of the freshman defensive lineman who died
Monday after collapsing in his dorm.</TE>
<TE>   Texas update: The Longhorns have a chance at a BCS bowl, providing
they don't lose. "I don't want to go out like a chump," quarterback
Chris Simms said. ''I want to go out like a champ."</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Tragedy has been too common for Texas A&amp;M in recent
years, with memories of the 1999 bonfire tragedy still fresh. Today's
game will be followed Saturday by the solemnity of a teammate's
funeral.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Texas. Simms has a history of trouble in big games, but
should win this one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 LOUISIANA STATE (8-3) at ARKANSAS (8-3)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 11:30 a.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Arkansas by 5.</TE>
<TE>   LSU update:  The Tigers have struggled down the stretch, going
2-2. Quarterback Marcus Randall came off the bench last week to bail
out the Tigers in a close victory over Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas update: Unranked Arkansas could end up in the Sugar Bowl.
All the Razorbacks, who started 3-3, have to do to qualify for an
automatic BCS bid is defeat LSU, then beat Georgia in the SEC title
game Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Big stakes: Winner goes to the SEC title game against
Georgia and gets a shot at a BCS bowl, mostly likely the Sugar.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Arkansas. The Razorbacks have won five in a row, and LSU
has been going the other direction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 MIAMI (10-0) at SYRACUSE (4-7)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 10 a.m. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Miami by 20.</TE>
<TE>   Miami update: Only two more steps to the national championship
game against Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl for the Hurricanes, whose
winning streak is 32 games. After Syracuse comes Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Syracuse update: Keep in mind, the Orangemen beat Virginia Tech,
but Miami has won the last three games against Syracuse by a combined
130-13. Syracuse's last victory over Miami was in 1998, 66-13, in the
Carrier Dome.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Only Miami can keep Miami from reaching the Fiesta
Bowl now, it seems.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Miami. The last time the Hurricanes lost to a team with
a losing record was 1978, a 20-16 loss to Tulane.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 NOTRE DAME (10-1) at No. 6 USC (9-2)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 5 p.m. Saturday</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: USC by 11.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame update: The Irish probably can sneak into a BCS game
with two losses, but finishing with one loss and a top-six BCS
ranking would guarantee a spot in one of the big bowls.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: The Trojans have plenty to gain from a victory,
possibly a BCS berth. USC will go to the Rose Bowl if UCLA can upset
Washington State on Dec. 7. Otherwise, the Trojans' BCS chances
depend on beating Notre Dame -- and a stumble by Oklahoma and
Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Both teams are in the top 10 for the first time since
1989.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC. The Irish defense is outstanding, but it can't stop
Carson Palmer enough for the Notre Dame offense to keep pace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GEORGIA TECH (7-4) at No. 5 GEORGIA (10-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. Saturday</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Georgia by 9.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech update: This is the first time since 1997 Georgia
Tech has gone into its rivalry game against the Bulldogs unranked.
The strength of this Yellow Jacket team is defense. None of the last
four opponents has scored more than 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia update: The Bulldogs are headed to the SEC title game, but
a loss would hurt their BCS ranking. Bottom line is Georgia better
win the SEC if the Bulldogs want to play in the Sugar Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: A loss by the Bulldogs could help USC reach the magic
No. 4 BCS ranking that would guarantee a BCS bowl appearance for the
Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Georgia, but it could be close.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 OKLAHOMA (10-1) at OKLAHOMA STATE (6-5)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 11:30 a.m. Saturday</TE>
<TE>   TV: Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Line: Oklahoma by 14 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma update: The Sooners will play Colorado in the Big 12
title game Dec. 7 in Houston, but a loss to rival Oklahoma State
would be costly, likely knocking the Sooners out of a BCS game if
they don't win the Big 12 next week.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State update: The Cowboys upset Oklahoma last season,
16-13, and have won four of their last five games.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The rivalry is known as the Bedlam Series. And if
Oklahoma State pulls another stunner, there could be BCS bedlam to
follow--with USC among the possible beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oklahoma. Sooners won't be caught snoozing two years in
a row.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A With John Madden and Pat Summerall</KH>
<HD>They Spent a Lifetime Carving Out a Tradition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Gray</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in 22 years John Madden and Pat Summerall were not
together broadcasting a football game on Thanksgiving. Last season's
Super Bowl in New Orleans was their final telecast together. With
numerous awards and acclaim, the two were widely recognized as the
best football broadcast duo of all time.</LD>
<LD>   Question: What's it like to be at home on Thanksgiving?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: John: Well, I don't know. I mean that's the thing, our
tradition. Pat's tradition and my tradition, we're always being
together and either being in Dallas or Detroit every other year,
having a dinner the night before, and then the day of the game having
turkey. Those things, the football game, and the camaraderie for the
last 22 years had been our family. That had been our tradition, and
now to come back to the traditional tradition is something that
hasn't been traditional to us.</LD>
<TE>   Q: Pat, does it seem odd to be without John and without the
football game at the site?</TE>
<TE>   A: Gosh, yeah, I can't tell you how much I miss him and doing the
game. Since we are not on the air, I would like to wish a very happy
Thanksgiving to everybody, particularly those of you who might have
put up with us for the last 21, 22 years. It was an enjoyable time;
it's a time that I'll cherish for as long as I live. I haven't been
home on Thanksgiving Day with family and friends since 1964. Being
with John was our tradition, and it's something that I miss very
much. However, it is nice to be home with friends and family and
watch and see what goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You're not carving the turkey after 38 years of being away, are
you Pat?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't have any idea how to carve a turkey. And, at this point
I don't think I want to learn.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What does Thanksgiving mean to you in a broader sense than just
the tradition of football being played?</TE>
<TE>   A: John: Well, you have to look at the big picture. We get so
caught up in our everyday lives and what we're doing and what people
around us are doing, that we think that's really all there is. Around
Thanksgiving time you step back and look at more than what's just
going on in your life or around you, but what's going on in our whole
country and what's going on in the whole world, and give thanks for
the good things we have in our life.</TE>
<TE>   Pat: I had the opportunity last week to play golf with a young man
who is stationed in Kuwait, who had a month leave before he was going
back, and I was just amazed at hearing the stories that he was
telling about the morale of the troops and, gosh, what a debt we owe
them who are stationed away from home on Thanksgiving. We have our
feelings about being apart, John and I do, but to see the morale and
the good spirit of that young man who was gonna be away for
Thanksgiving and Christmas, and they don't know when something might
happen ... to see how good he felt about what he was doing, living in
America and representing our country, is something that I'll
eternally give thanks for. To think that I was born in this country,
and the fact that I've enjoyed such a great life in this country with
such great friends ... is what I'm thankful for.</TE>
<TE>   Q: On Thanksgiving at the end of the game you gave out turkey legs
to the players of the game. Will you do that at another time now?</TE>
<TE>   A: John: Well, I think that's something that's gonna be retired. I
mean that's something that Pat and I did for so many years, you know,
the Turkey Leg Award, and it was kind of fun. You know, when you had
the game and then you had the turkey there and then we had the
Turducken. And what a Turducken is, is a de-boned chicken, stuffed in
a de-boned duck, stuffed in a de-boned turkey with between the
chicken and the duck is a dressing, and between the duck and the
turkey is a dressing, so when you cut down through it you get turkey,
dressing, duck, dressing, chicken. We met someone in New Orleans
years ago that gave us our first Turducken. I mean, it just got
bigger and bigger and we were being sent more and more birds, and it
was just a lot of fun.</TE>
<TE>   Pat: The tradition sort of built over the years, and the players
came to find it very important to perform well in the Thanksgiving
Day game just so they'd get one of those turkey legs. It just grew
and grew and grew and the number of legs grew and grew and grew. It
got to be a big ceremony; a big tradition for John's two bus drivers
where they got a chance to walk down on the field carrying the
turkeys like they were some descendant of royalty or something like
that. And it got to be cherished by and fun for the players and for
us.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Could you ever imagine a Thanksgiving Day without football?</TE>
<TE>   A: Pat: I really can't. It's been such a part of my life. I can't
imagine. I've never done it before. My family got used to having
Thanksgiving on Friday, if I was lucky enough to make it home on
Thursday night. So they were out of sync along with me, and that's
the thing that you don't realize. How much your own family misses the
traditions of Thanksgiving Day when everybody else is celebrating
Thanksgiving Day because you're never there. I wouldn't swap it for
anything, but it does take some adjustments on the parts of other
people.</TE>
<TE>   John: Pat, I don't mean to be asking the questions, but I'm just
kind of thinking this to myself. If you had your choice, would you
rather be home for Thanksgiving, or would you rather be doing a game
for Thanksgiving?</TE>
<TE>   Pat: I think you know the answer to that. I'd rather be doing a
game. I'd rather be doing a game and so would you.</TE>
<TE>   John: That's exactly right.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will there ever be another team like the two of you?</TE>
<TE>   A: John: I don't know that there'll ever be another team that
anyone would allow to stay together as we were allowed to stay
together. That was a big thing. No one came in and fouled it up. No
one came in and said, "Well, let's split 'em up; let's try something
different." We went through a lot of changes. Not only changes within
a company, like different presidents, different executive producers,
but also changing from CBS to Fox. I think that I was the luckiest
guy in the world to be able to do what I'm doing and then to be able
to do it with Pat Summerall. Believe me, it was special. He's a very
special guy. I was lucky because I kind of fell into it and got
started and he really helped me and brought me along our whole time
together. I don't know that it will ever happen again because I don't
know that anyone is ever gonna let that happen again.</TE>
<TE>   Pat: That's probably right. I have much the same feeling as John
expressed. I was lucky, too. To be with him when he started and to
watch him develop and become what he is, the best analyst there's
ever been in any sport. I'm thankful for that association, and to
have him as a friend. Gosh, we have a lot to be thankful for, nothing
to be bitter about.</TE>

<LD>Andres Cantor is the soccer announcer known for yelling,
"Gooooooooaaalll!"</LD>
<LD>   Now the host of Telemundo's new NBA studio show, he is looking for
another signature word or phrase.</LD>
<LD>   Fans are invited to sign on the NBA.com/espanol and offer advice.</LD>
<TE>   Early suggestions include: "Slllaaammm Duuunnnkkk," "It's
Goooooooooood" and "Sweeeeeeeshhh."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes fan participation isn't such a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Carson Palmer broke the USC record for passing yards
with 448 in a 44-33 victory over Oregon this season. Who held the
previous record?</TE>
<TE>   Family man: Brendan Shanahan of the Detroit Red Wings likes being
a new father of twins.</TE>
<TE>   "With this team, it feels natural," he told Mitch Albom of the
Detroit Free Press. "You come to practice on the weekends and see the
players with their kids out on the ice, all these Stanley Cup
champions teaching 6- and 7-year olds how to skate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm now one of the guys."</TE>
<TE>   Call him "Anna": The marketing agent for New York Giant rookie
tight end Jeremy Shockey recently compared his client to Anna
Kournikova. The New York Daily News responded with a back-page layout
featuring photos of both.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Coach Jim Fassel says he is now calling Shockey "Anna."</TE>
<TE>   Money-grubber: Annika Sorenstam would have finished eighth on the
PGA Tour money list with $2,863,904. Not bad considering the total
purse on the LPGA Tour was $43.5 million -- compared to just under
$200 million on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Name game: Humor correspondent Wanda Sykes of HBO's "Inside the
NFL" made this point on Thursday night's show:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thankful that a lot of corporations got busted by the feds so
they can stop naming stuff. You won't be hearing Martha Stewart
Stadium anytime soon."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Mike Van Raaphorst passed for 415 yards against
Stanford in 1999. USC lost that game, 35-31.</TE>
<TE>   Raptor rap: Vince Carter appeared on stage in Toronto recently
during a concert by the rapper Nelly -- on the same night his team,
the Raptors, were getting soundly beaten, 117-92, by the Atlanta
Hawks in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, who played Wednesday for the first time since Nov. 2
because of a strained quadriceps, angered more than a few Raptor fans
who thought he should have been home watching the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares?" Carter said in Newsday. "It was a concert; I went
there to enjoy it just like anybody else. I'm a grown man. They [his
critics] don't pay my bills, they don't make decisions for me."</TE>
<TE>   Add Carter: Coming to Carter's defense was Raptor General Manager
Glen Grunwald, who said, "Maybe he had the game on and turned it off,
which is something I might have been tempted to do. I wish I had been
at the concert [instead of the game]."</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Carter's response is reminiscent of the classic
Benoit Benjamin line when he played for the Clippers: "I don't give a
... about the fans."</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the late Jim Healy's favorites.</TE>

<HD>Battle of Mississippi Goes to the Rebels</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mississippi wiped away more than a month's worth of misery with one
victory over its archrival.</LD>
<LD>   Eli Manning connected with Chris Collins for two touchdown passes
to lead the Rebels to a 24-12 victory over Mississippi State on
Thursday night in a Southeastern Conference game at Oxford, Miss.</LD>
<LD>   The Rebels (6-6, 3-5 in the SEC) snapped a five-game losing streak
and became bowl eligible. They are likely headed to the Independence
Bowl or Music City Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   "Five weeks seems a long time ago after tonight," Mississippi
center Ben Claxton said.</TE>
<TE>   The 99th meeting between the archrivals was a dreary ending to the
worst season in Coach Jackie Sherrill's 12-year tenure at Mississippi
State.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (3-9, 0-8) finished winless in the SEC for the first
time since 1988 and lost their last five games. For Sherrill, it's
the first nine-loss season of his 25-year career.</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation that Sherrill's job is in jeopardy, but
Athletic Director Larry Templeton said after the game he had no plans
to meet with his coach this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Sherrill, who turned 59 Thursday, said he intends to return.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the kind of guy, when you put a knot on my head, I'm going to
try to repay that knot," Sherrill said.</TE>
<TE>   Manning was 16 of 29 for 207 yards with two interceptions and a
touchdown run. Collins caught four passes for 130 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Fant was 23 of 42 for 340 yards with a touchdown and three
interceptions for Mississippi State. Brent Smith kicked two field
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State, the most turnover-prone team in the SEC, helped
set up Mississippi's game-sealing touchdown with its 37th giveaway of
the season. Travis Johnson intercepted Fant at the Bulldog 26 and
returned it to the four with about six minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Manning sneaked in from the one three plays later to make it
24-12.</TE>
<TE>   "Turnovers hurt us bad," receiver Ray Ray Bivines said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado running back Chris Brown is questionable for today's game
against Nebraska because of a bruised sternum. Bobby Purify, who is
averaging 5.9 yards a carry, will play if Brown is unable to
participate. Nebraska will be without kicker Josh Brown, who was
suspended earlier this week after he was arrested on suspicion of
driving under the influence early Sunday.... Hawaii quarterback Timmy
Chang, who has injuries to his left knee and the thumb on his
throwing hand, is listed as probable for Saturday's game against
Alabama.... Keith Glantz, who sets the Glantz-Culver line, offered
the following point spreads if No. 1 Miami makes it to the bowl
championship series title game in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3: Miami
would be favored by 10 1/2 points over Ohio State, 5 1/2 over
Oklahoma, 8 over Iowa, 9 over Georgia, and 14 1/2 over Notre Dame.</TE>

<HD>Miller Gets Point Across</HD>
<DH>He scores 37 points and forces overtime with three-pointer
to outduel Kidd and lead Clippers past Nets, 126-118.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Above all, it was cathartic for the Clippers. Their 126-118 overtime
victory over the New Jersey Nets was many things at many times
Thursday at Staples Center. But, in the final analysis, it was simply
a soothing victory for a team desperate for something to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   At the end, with a crowd of 16,277 standing and cheering, the
Clippers heaped praise upon point guard Andre Miller. It was Miller
who hoisted his teammates on his back for long stretches, keeping
them in the game and ultimately leading them to their third victory
in nine games at Staples.</LD>
<LD>   Miller outdueled Jason Kidd by any measure available to judge two
of the NBA's best point guards, enabling the Clippers to reach
overtime with a three-point basket with 4.9 seconds remaining in
regulation that tied the score at 111.</LD>
<TE>   Miller tied his career-best with 37 points on 14-for-24 shooting,
added a season-best 16 assists and orchestrated a Clipper comeback
from an 11-0 deficit to start the game with 48 minutes of his best
ball in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "As good as it
gets. The guy on the other end [Kidd]...."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry let out a low whistle.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are two pretty darn good point guards," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd went for 35 points on 12-for-24 shooting and added eight
assists and eight rebounds in 42 minutes. He was powerless to halt
the Clippers' charge from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter
and couldn't slow them during overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "Die another day, baby," said Clipper forward Elton Brand, who had
21 points. "I think it was imperative that we got this win. We won
this game down in the trenches, when it was a two-point lead, a
three-point lead."</TE>
<TE>   Of Miller, Brand said, "He was on fire. He really stepped up.
That's the best he's played for us."</TE>
<TE>   A 15-0 run in the fourth quarter brought the Clippers from a 96-86
deficit into a 101-96 lead in about 4 1/2 minutes. The Clippers would
lose the lead, but fought back to force overtime when Eric Piatkowski
faked two Nets off their feet and found an open Miller along the left
wing.</TE>
<TE>   Bingo.</TE>
<TE>   Overtime hasn't been kind to the Clippers in recent seasons. They
had lost seven consecutive, including a 101-99 defeat Nov. 6 against
the Philadelphia 76ers. But the Clippers did not falter in the
five-minute extra period Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Brand's driving layup and free throw after he was fouled gave the
Clippers the lead for good, 118-116, with 3:02 remaining. Quentin
Richardson followed with a jump shot from the right wing off an
assist from Miller for a 120-116 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Game over.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Clippers saw the Nets, on Nov. 8, Kidd was a
blur. He scored 35 points, including 27 in the second half, when the
Nets pulled away for a 106-92 victory at East Rutherford, N.J. Miller
had 20 points in that game.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd and the Nets were less impressive during Wednesday's 82-75
defeat against the Suns at Phoenix, the second stop on a five-game
trip to the West. The Nets' woeful 26-for-88 shooting (29.5%) tied
the lowest field-goal percentage in America West Arena history and
doomed them to their fifth loss in 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd's five-for-21 shooting en route to 17 points in 40 minutes
didn't do much to aid the Nets' cause against his former team.
Phoenix fans booed Kidd, sent to New Jersey for Stephon Marbury
before the 2001-02 season began.</TE>
<TE>   In the rematch between the Clippers and Nets on Thursday, Miller
and Kidd went at each other from the start. By halftime, Miller had
19 points on eight-for-11 shooting and Kidd had 13 points on
five-for-eight shooting.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey had a 54-50 lead by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets started as if they had a plane to catch, winning the
opening tip and racing to leads of 11-0 and 13-2 before the Clippers
snapped to life and, eventually, seized a 24-19 lead of their own
after Piatkowski made a three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey would take control again in the second, when Lucious
Harris kept the Nets ahead with three three-pointers and a jump shot
in the final moments of the quarter.</TE>

<KH>DALLAS 27, WASHINGTON 20</KH>
<HD>Cowboys Spurrier-ed On to Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>Steve Spurrier stirred up most of the Dallas Cowboys with a comment
he made 10 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   For Emmitt Smith, the motivation to beat the Washington Redskins'
coach began in 1989, when he was a junior at Florida.</LD>
<LD>   The payback provided a new spin to what's becoming a redundant
story line: Dallas beating Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The Cowboys won 27-20 Thursday, beating the Redskins for the 10th
consecutive time and turning what once was the league's most bitter
rivalry into its most lopsided. No other team has won as many in a
row against another team.</TE>
<TE>   Smith led the way with 144 yards rushing, his most in two years.
Roy Williams returned an interception for a touchdown late in the
third quarter, then Joey Galloway strutted into the end zone with the
go-ahead score early in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "We said all along how much we respect them and what Spurrier has
going," Cowboy owner Jerry Jones said. "That made that effort from
our players all the more sweeter."</TE>
<TE>   The streak is remarkable, considering the Cowboys (5-7) are only
33-48 against the rest of the league during the span, which began in
November 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier vowed things would change when he was hired in January,
even promising owner Dan Snyder the game ball from his first victory
over Dallas. A clip of that comment was played inside Texas Stadium
just before kickoff, drawing boos that quickly turned to cheers when
the screen turned black except for the words, "Not Today Steve!"</TE>
<TE>   "No game balls on this side," said Spurrier, noting that the teams
play again Dec. 29 in Washington. "Hopefully we'll give them a little
better test next time."</TE>
<TE>   Smith's bitterness toward Spurrier dates to college. He had a year
of eligibility left when Spurrier took over the Gators, and the coach
hardly made an effort to convince him to come back for his senior
year.</TE>
<TE>   Slights, real or perceived, have driven Smith to the top of the
NFL rushing list, and the chance to prove this point fueled his best
day since Dec. 10, 2000, when he had 150 yards against -- who else?
-- the Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   Smith had seven runs of at least 11 yards, upping his career total
to 17,021, despite bruising his hand and straining his neck. This was
his 76th 100-yard game, tying Barry Sanders for second-most in league
history, one behind Walter Payton.</TE>
<TE>   "You start adding elements like Spurrier, the 'Skins -- it makes
it more special," Smith said. "I knew I was having a good game."</TE>
<TE>   After a first quarter that showed why both teams are among the
bottom six offenses in the league, the game featured a little of
everything: a blocked punt, blocked field-goal attempt, missed
extra-point try, an interception returned for a touchdown and a
missed field-goal attempt.</TE>
<TE>   There was a bit of the wacky too: Washington had to have its
kicker, James Tuthill, punt because the punter, Bryan Barker, broke
his nose.</TE>
<TE>   Things were looking good for Washington (5-7) when Danny Wuerffel
threw his third touchdown pass for a 20-10 lead early in the third
quarter. The scores came over four drives, with the only exception a
two-play, clock-killing series at the end of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But the Redskins missed the extra-point attempt.</TE>

<HD>Kariya Hopes He's Ready to Break Out</HD>

<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent vanishing act that has been Paul Kariya materialized for
the Mighty Ducks on Wednesday night. There is a need for him to make
many more appearances.</LD>
<LD>   Kariya had a power-play goal -- set up beautifully by center Steve
Rucchin -- and in the Ducks' 2-2 tie with Phoenix on Wednesday. He
also nearly won the game in overtime, firing a shot from the blue
line, then charging the net to get a second shot off the rebound.</LD>
<LD>   But the goal was only Kariya's second in the last 10 games.</LD>
<TE>   "If you're not getting opportunities to score, it's not a good
thing," said Kariya, who had four shots on goal Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes that happens from game to game. Overall, my shot total
is up a little bit. Sometimes you're just not in position to shoot
the puck. You can be creating offensively without the puck. But there
are just times when I just have to start ripping the puck and not
look for the pretty play."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will take it either way, as long as Kariya scores. He
had 32 goals last season, his lowest total for a full season. His
numbers are up this season with a team-high 10 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Kariya was a non-factor in recent games.</TE>
<TE>   "You're best player has to be your best player every night," Coach
Mike Babcock said. "I know that and he knows that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ruslan Salei, one of the Ducks' top defensemen, is doubtful for
today's game against the Kings because of back spasms and a bruised
elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Salei was injured in the first period Wednesday. He played one
shift in the second period, then left the game. He had X-rays
afterward that were negative. Salei said the back spasms are what
could keep him out.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened when I was hit in the first period," Salei said. "I
re-aggravated it when I tried to play. We'll just have to see how I
feel [today]."</TE>
<TE>   Babcock said no one would be recalled from Cincinnati at this
time.</TE>

<HD>Gann and Frankel Make Dynamic Duo</HD>
<DH>Owner has been working for almost 30 years with
Hall-of-Fame trainer, who is close to earnings record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Owner Ed Gann and trainer Bobby Frankel were in the claiming-horse
business, though not together, in California in the early 1970s.
Frankel, a brash newcomer from New York, won 60 races -- still the
record -- at Hollywood Park in 1972.</LD>
<LD>   Gann, meanwhile, was struggling with a small stable of cheap
horses. In what might have passed for a compliment, one day Frankel
claimed a filly of Gann's out of a race for $20,000. Later, Frankel
bred the filly to Cannonade, the 1974 Kentucky Derby winner, and sold
the offspring for $128,000.</LD>
<LD>   "I said to myself that I've got to meet this Frankel guy," Gann
said as he recalled the story.</LD>
<TE>   He sent Frankel over to inspect the 10 horses Gann was then
running.</TE>
<TE>   "He came back and said he didn't like any of them," Gann said. "He
suggested that I start over. Finally, he said that maybe a couple
were worth keeping. I hired him as my trainer, and now we've been
together almost 30 years. I must be his oldest client."</TE>
<TE>   As the season winds down, Frankel has an outside chance to break
the purse record that trainer Wayne Lukas set in 1988. Winning 318
races 14 years ago, the Lukas barn earned $17,842,358. Frankel, who's
at $16,619,440, is, as usual, operating on multiple fronts this
weekend, and will send out horses in races worth more than $3 million
at Hollywood Park, Churchill Downs and Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to win some of those 500-granders to have a shot," Frankel
said. "If it happens, it happens. You need some luck as well as the
good horses. I think my horses are ready, but you never know until
afterward. Sometimes you work a horse and he gives you a perfect
workout, and then he runs terrible. Sometimes a work is messed up and
then the horse runs his eyeballs out. It's not a science."</TE>
<TE>   Frankel's outfit has won 54 stakes races this year, 40 of them
graded events and 14 of those in Grade I stakes. The Lukas record of
92 stakes wins, set in 1987 when his barn earned $17.5 million, is
safe for another year -- and probably all years.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of Frankel's stakes wins this year have come with horses
campaigned by Gann, a 79-year-old Rancho Santa Fe businessman. The
Gann-Frankel relationship has not been without its bumps -- Gann once
said that having the shoot-from-the-hip Frankel as a trainer was like
trying to work with the demanding owner of the New York Yankees,
George Steinbrenner -- but the bottom line is that Frankel,
regardless of his brusque style, keeps sending Gann to the winner's
circle. In the last two years, Gann's horses have earned $5.6
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankel knows horses -- he gets them to do things nobody else
does -- and he's a good manager," Gann said. "He also knows how to
deal with the people that work for him. A lot of those guys have been
with him longer than I have. The people you have working for you are
everything in this game."</TE>
<TE>   When Frankel was voted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1995, the
plaque at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., didn't include Gann's name among
the major owners who had helped the trainer get there. Frankel
insisted the plaque be redone to correct the oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Gann's leading runners this year have been Medaglia d'Oro, who won
the Travers and finished second in the Belmont Stakes and the
Breeders' Cup Classic; and You, one of the best 3-year-old fillies in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel has also won 17 stakes for the Juddmonte Farm of Prince
Khalid Abdullah, a member of Saudi Arabia's royal family.</TE>
<TE>   For Juddmonte, Frankel trains Beat Hollow, winner of three Grade I
stakes, and Tates Creek and Banks Hill, who'll be running Sunday in
the $500,000 Matriarch at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel has won the Matriarch four times in the last six years,
including last year with Starine, who gave him his second Breeders'
Cup win when she won the Filly &amp; Mare Turf at Arlington Park last
month.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby is patient with his horses, he's very good at picking the
right spots to run, and the help he has at the barn is out of this
world," said Doug O'Neill, the leading trainer at Hollywood Park this
meet. "Those guys stick with him year after year. Bobby himself is a
workaholic. If he wins a million-dollar race, he'll still be at the
barn early the next morning."</TE>
<TE>   Among the veterans at the barn are Humberto Ascanio, hired by
Frankel in 1973 after he had worked for leading trainers Buster
Millerick and Farrell Jones for five years; Ruben Loza, the stable
foreman who came aboard in 1977; and Al Schwizer, who at 66, five
years older than Frankel, still exercises four or five head a morning
for the contingent at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend is typical: While the boss pinballs his way from
Churchill Downs to Aqueduct, Ascanio will be responsible for saddling
duties at Hollywood Park, until Frankel returns Sunday for two of
those $500,000 races he was talking about.</TE>
<TE>   Except for one gap in the late 1970s, Schwizer has been galloping
horses for Frankel since 1972. Together, they came out of New York,
where Frankel, earning $3 a day as a hot-walker, once thought that
the best thing about the job was a parking permit that helped cut
down his betting overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby's the best," Schwizer said. "When it comes to horses, he's
got something upstairs that nobody's got. He's right about 99% of the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Frankel led the country in purses with $8.8 million in 1993,
stopping Wayne Lukas' 10-year hold on the title. He has won three
Eclipse Awards for training, in 1993 and the last two years, and if
there's a void in his record it's in the Triple Crown races. He has
never won a Kentucky Derby, Preakness or Belmont, although in recent
years he's come close. Medaglia d'Oro was fourth in the Derby and
second in the Belmont this year, and Frankel ran second in the 2000
Belmont with Aptitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, I haven't had that many 2-year-olds that I could
develop," Frankel said. "But now I seem to be getting a few more. If
you've got the horse, the Derby's no different than any other race.</TE>
<TE>   "You've just got to have them ready to do what they need to do on
the big day."</TE>
<TE>   For Gann, Frankel recently bought a 2-year-old filly, Summer
Scene, from Mark Reid, the same trainer-turned-bloodstock-agent who
sold him Medaglia d'Oro, You and another stakes winner, Labamta Babe.
Summer Scene is scheduled to run Saturday in the Demoiselle at
Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Frankel will saddle Empire Maker for Juddmonte in
the Remsen Stakes for 2-year-old males. Off only one race, an easy
mile win at Belmont Park last month, the well-bred Empire Maker has
become one of the early buzz horses for next year's Kentucky Derby.
On the Frankel resume, winning a pair of 2-year-old stakes on the
same day would be another new entry.</TE>

<LD>A veteran, take-no-prisoners defenseman strapped on a helmet and
joined the Kings for practice Thursday morning. But assistant coach
Mark Hardy, 43, will not be activated for today's game against the
Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   Other help, however, arrived later from Manchester, N.H.</LD>
<LD>   With the status of newly acquired defenseman Dmitry Yushkevich
still uncertain, Ian Laperriere unavailable and Lubomir Visnovsky
joining Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh and Ken Belanger on injured
reserve, the Kings recalled defenseman Jason Holland and forwards
Steve Heinze and Kip Brennan from their American Hockey League team.</LD>
<TE>   Pavel Rosa, recalled Tuesday and in the lineup for Wednesday
night's 5-2 loss to the Florida Panthers, was sent back to
Manchester.</TE>
<TE>   Yushkevich, traded from the Panthers on Tuesday but kept out of
Wednesday's game because of a ruptured blood vessel in his right eye,
watched practice. His status for today's game will be determined
after an eye exam this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Johnson, meanwhile, will be checked for a hand injury
suffered Wednesday night when he was struck in the palm by an errant
puck.</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere, who suffered a concussion Saturday night when
sandwiched between Derian Hatcher and Ulf Dahlen of the Dallas Stars,
won't play today and probably won't play Saturday night against the
Chicago Blackhawks. Visnovsky, suffering from a back strain, won't be
eligible to return until next week.</TE>
<TE>   Heinze, 32, wasn't expected back after the Kings reassigned him to
the minors two days before the season opener. They left him exposed
in the waiver draft and told him he was free to seek a trade. Club
President Tim Leiweke called him a bust, citing Heinze's struggles
during the second half of last season as a reason for the Kings'
decision not to pursue high-priced free agents last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Signed to a three-year, $6-million contract in July 2001, Heinze
scored 15 goals last season, but none in his last 27 games.</TE>
<TE>   At Manchester, he scored eight goals and 17 points in 18 games.</TE>

<LD>MIAMI AT BUFFALO</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Miami by 2 1/2.</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Hard to beat a good team twice. But it's December in
Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Miami is 7-4 and leads the AFC East. Buffalo has lost three
in a row and is 3-7 in its last 10 games against AFC East opponents.
But Sunday is Dec. 1, known by Dolphin and Bill fans as the great
equalizer. The Dolphins are 1-4 in their last five December visits to
Buffalo -- and that has been with quarterbacks named Dan Marino and
Jay Fiedler, not Ray Lucas, who had his infamous "worst game ever
played" in a 23-10 loss to Buffalo on Oct. 20. Lucas, 2-2 since, gets
one last chance before Fiedler and his healed broken thumb return to
the lineup Dec. 9. Miami battle cry: One For The Thumb!</TE>

<TE>   CHICAGO AT GREEN BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 9 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Packers officially caught looking ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Bears-Packers used to be the fiercest rivalry in pro
football, but the Packers have seen the Bears this season, and thus
spent all week talking about Warren Sapp's season-ending hit on Green
Bay offensive tackle Chad Clifton and what might happen to Sapp the
next time the Packers play Tampa Bay. After Green Bay offensive line
coach Larry Beightol phoned Tampa Bay defensive coordinator Monte
Kiffin to warn that Sapp "could be cut-blocked next time we see him,"
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue issued a memo to cease and desist. An
ideal upset opportunity for the Bears. Except, they're the Bears.</TE>

<TE>   TENNESSEE AT NEW YORK GIANTS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Their own worst enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Never mind what the marquee says. Sunday, it's the Titans
against the Titans and the Giants against the Giants, same as it was
last weekend, when the two playoff contenders took to the road to
carbo-load for the stretch run -- and both went hungry. The Giants
turned the ball over three times in a 16-14 loss to the expansion
Houston Texans. The Titans outgained Baltimore, 402 yards to 199, but
gave away the ball four times, along with the game, 13-12.
Tennessee's Eddie George, three yards shy of Earl Campbell's
franchise rushing record (8,574), could run wild against the Giants'
injury-riddled defense.</TE>

<TE>   ARIZONA AT KANSAS CITY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Kansas City by 9 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Hold that call.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The-dog-ate-my-playbook probably wasn't going to fool
anyone, so credit Arizona running back Thomas Jones with creativity,
if nothing else, for getting out of the rest of the season by
claiming he broke his hand while attempting to answer the phone. Are
the Cardinals really buying that one? Well, they've seen Jones handle
the football, so, theoretically, such an accident is plausible. But
the Cardinals won't be paying for it. The team has placed Jones on
the reserve/non-football injury list, meaning they don't have to pay
him for the last five games. Including the next Cardinal defeat,
coming up on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Cardinals Phone It In"</TE>

<TE>   BALTIMORE AT CINCINNATI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Baltimore by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Lucky man, that Michael Westbrook.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Westbrook never fulfilled the promise he brought with him
into the NFL in 1995, so his off-season signing with the Pro Football
Hall of Underachievement, also known as the Cincinnati Bengals,
seemed a perfect fit. Alas, the Bengals were too maddening for even
Westbrook, who lobbied for and finally received his release from the
team Wednesday. On the Bengals' Web site, Westbrook described the
move as "a combination of them giving up on me and my heart not being
into it. I don't know if I'll play again. I'm just going to go home
and play with the kids and laugh about the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bengals Lose, Go Home, Laugh About The
Situation"</TE>

<TE>   CAROLINA AT CLEVELAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Cleveland by 7 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Dwayne Rudd rears his ugly helmet again.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Not to beat this into the ground or anything, but if Rudd
hadn't beaten his helmet prematurely into the ground and negated a
season-opening victory over Kansas City, the Browns would be 7-4 and
alone atop the AFC North standings. As it is, Cleveland is a
half-game behind Pittsburgh after putting together the league's
quietest 4-1 run while averaging 26 points a game. Carolina,
meanwhile, is 0-8 since being 3-0 -- the league's longest losing
streak. Coach John Fox hasn't given up on the season, sticking with
quarterback Rodney Peete. Which means he has given up on Chris
Weinke.</TE>

Anyone"</TE>

<TE>   PITTSBURGH AT JACKSONVILLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Is it Maddox or Stewart? Wouldn't the Jaguars like to
know?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Doctors have cleared Tommy Maddox to play Sunday, but
Steeler Coach Bill Cowher is not giving away any edge he might hold.
He hasn't named a starting quarterback for the Jacksonville game,
giving Kordell Stewart the majority of the early-week practice snaps.
This, Cowher believes, complicates things for the Jaguars, who have
to prepare for two styles. Will it be Maddox's quick-release
drop-back approach? Or Stewart's out-of-the-pocket stylings? Really,
it's apples and oranges. Or touchdown passes and interceptions. More
than likely, Cowher will go for the touchdowns.</TE>

<TE>   ATLANTA AT MINNESOTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Atlanta by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Two 0-2 teams, believe it or not, once upon a time.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Incredible but true: On the evening of Sept. 15, both the
Falcons and the Vikings stood at 0-2. More incredible but still true:
During the first two weeks of the 2002 season, both the Falcons and
the Vikings lost to the Bears. Since then, the teams have provided
case studies in how to turn your season around and how to fold it in.
Atlanta owns the NFL's longest unbeaten streak at 6-0-1 and is coming
off a 41-0 rout of Carolina. Minnesota is 3-8 overall, Randy Moss
regressing to where he now physically takes himself out of big plays,
handing over the title of "Best Young Player" to Michael Vick.</TE>

<TE>   HOUSTON AT INDIANAPOLIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 11 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Premature publication.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Today at Reliant Stadium, Houston Texan Coach Dom Capers
will sign copies of the just-published quickie coffee table book,
"Opening Night," a 144-page retrospective of the Texans' inaugural
game on Sept. 8, a 19-10 upset victory over Dallas. No kidding. The
book, expected to be a popular Christmas gift around Houston, sells
for $30. No kidding. Later, Capers and his team will fly to
Indianapolis for the 12th game in their history, against the Colts,
7-4 after last week's overtime victory over Denver and trying to
write their ticket to playoffs. Working title: "Sunday Bloody
Sunday."</TE>

<TE>   DENVER AT SAN DIEGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Denver by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Portis heads for big day.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Broncos have won 20 consecutive games when one of their
running backs rushes for 100 yards -- and they have just seen the
game films of Ricky Williams pounding the Charger defense in last
Sunday's 30-3 Miami victory. Look for more of the same from Denver's
Clinton Portis, who heads all rookie running backs with 836 yards
rushing. The great San Diego revival has lost much of its early
sweetness; the Chargers were 1-3 in November, including one-sided
losses to the Jets (44-13) and the Dolphins. Worse still for San
Diego: The Broncos are 9-2 in their last 11 games against the
Chargers.</TE>

<TE>   ST. LOUIS AT PHILADELPHIA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 2 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Who is A.J. Feeley, and what is he doing
quarterbacking the Eagles in December?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In a span of eight days, Donovan McNabb breaks an ankle and
Koy Detmer dislocates an elbow and just like that, A.J. Feeley, a
second-year third stringer who last started a game in 1999 -- as a
college junior -- is in the Eagles' starting lineup. A fifth-round
draft choice in 2001, Feeley preceded Joey Harrington as the starting
quarterback at Oregon before getting injured. He was the backup to
Harrington as a senior. His 2002 passing: three for three, 17 yards
and a touchdown. In other quarterbacking news, Kurt Warner goes for
his first win of the season for the Rams.</TE>

<TE>   SEATTLE AT SAN FRANCISCO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 9</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Sharpie: The Sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Seahawks have had this date circled on the calendar --
in red, Sharpie felt tip -- since Oct. 14, the night they were
embarrassed on national TV by Terrell Owens and his hideaway pen.
Obviously, Seattle's defenders will be fired up for the rematch.
Question is: What can they do about it? The Seahawks are 3-3 in their
last six, including last Sunday's 39-32 victory over Kansas City. But
worth noting: the Seahawks were outgained, 552-534, by the Chiefs.
San Francisco squandered a Monday night gimme, losing to the Eagles'
No. 2 and 3 quarterbacks, 38-17, and can't afford to throw away
another.</TE>

<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 1.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: New Orleans, not exactly peaking at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Tampa Bay is the NFL's only two-loss team -- and one of
those defeats came against the Saints, who got the Jon Gruden era off
to a clattering start with a 26-20 victory over the Buccaneers in the
season opener. The Buccaneers are 9-1 since then and lead the NFL in
team defense, holding opponents to an average of 11.5 points. The
Saints haven't held anyone below 20 points all season, are coming off
consecutive losses to Atlanta and Cleveland and have a battered
running back in Deuce McAllister. Another loss Sunday and the Saints
will spend December chasing the last wild card.</TE>

<TE>   NEW YORK JETS AT OAKLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 6</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Two teams on a roll, but one stops here.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: "Even when we were 2-5," Jet quarterback Chad Pennington
says, "it was like, 'Why not us? Why can't we make history?' " Here
are a few reasons: The Jets, 4-0 since then, run into the Raiders on
Monday. The Raiders have won their last three games by an average of
17 points. The Raiders beat the Jets, 38-24, the last time the two
teams met, in last season's playoffs. The Raiders have a quarterback,
Rich Gannon, on pace to break the league's single-season passing
yardage record. And after the Raiders, the Jets will play Denver,
Chicago, New England and Green Bay. Wait till next year.</TE>

<HD>No Thumbs Up, but Fiedler Gets Closer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami Dolphin quarterback Jay Fiedler took some snaps with the
first-team offense Thursday, another step in coming back from a
broken right thumb.</LD>
<LD>   Fiedler practiced for the second consecutive day as he tries to
work into playing condition after being injured Oct. 13 at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "Jay took more work than he did Wednesday," Coach Dave Wannstedt
said. "He's not where he would like to be, but I think he's right on
schedule where we hoped he would be."</LD>
<TE>   Wannstedt said that Fiedler probably will be in uniform as the No.
2 or No. 3 quarterback Sunday at Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Griese and Shannon Sharpe made it through a second practice
without any setbacks, but it was unclear whether they will play for
Denver against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan said his starting quarterback and tight
end will have to go through more rigorous workouts before a decision
is made about Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "Both looked pretty good. It's going to be a game-time decision,"
Shanahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Griese returned to practice Wednesday for the first time since
spraining his left knee against Seattle on Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan said Griese was sore Thursday morning, but it wasn't
enough to keep him from practicing.</TE>
<TE>   "Just out here he looks pretty good, but until he really puts
pressure on it in a scrambling situation, you don't know for sure,"
Shanahan said. "He doesn't want to overdo it right now. He's looking
good with what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe made huge strides since partially separating his right
elbow against Oakland on Nov. 11. He was expected to miss up to a
month, but returned to practice Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Panther running back Lamar Smith was charged with drunken
driving, the latest legal embarrassment for the team.</TE>
<TE>   The player, 31, was charged with driving while impaired, speeding
and reckless driving, according to a deputy with the Mecklenburg
County Sheriff's Department. Smith was released several hours later
after posting a $1,200 bond.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colt running back Edgerrin James returned to practice after an
ankle injury and is expected to start against the Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Brad Scioli, however, might not be able to play at
home against the Texans. He missed his second day of practice because
of an injured shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Scioli has been playing defensive end and defensive tackle this
season, filling in at tackle primarily because of injuries to Josh
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   If Scioli can't play, veteran Chukie Nwokorie or rookie Raheem
Brock -- both defensive ends -- might be moved inside.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed defensive end Ron Warner to a
one-year contract and put defensive end Corey Smith on injured
reserve.</TE>

<HD>Blackhawks Put Hurt on Amonte, Coyotes, 4-2</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Zhamnov made sure Tony Amonte didn't enjoy his reunion with his
former Chicago teammates.</LD>
<LD>   Zhamnov, who succeeded Amonte as Chicago's captain when his old
linemate signed with Phoenix in July, had a goal and an assist to
help the Blackhawks beat the Coyotes, 4-2, Thursday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Daze also had a goal and an assist, and Sergei Berezin and
Nathan Dempsey scored as Chicago ended a four-game losing streak in
the fifth game of its road trip. Jocelyn Thibault made 34 saves.</LD>
<TE>   Shane Doan scored twice for the Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Amonte had a seven-year low in goals (27) last season after what
he claims was a Thanksgiving Day 2001 interview during which Chicago
General Manager Mike Smith told him he would not be re-signed.</TE>
<TE>   The Blackhawks scored four times in the first period, jumping on
Brian Boucher, who stopped only 14 shots after making 33 saves in a
2-2 tie against the Ducks the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 7, New York Rangers 4 -- Patrik Stefan, Chris Herperger
and Shawn McEachern each scored two goals as the Thrashers ended a
three-game losing streak with a victory at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Flyer scoring leader John LeClair will be out
indefinitely because of a dislocated right shoulder after he collided
with an opponent Wednesday and crashed into the boards. LeClair is
scheduled for tests today, but Coach Ken Hitchcock said the
33-year-old left wing will miss "some significant time." LeClair has
11 goals and 17 points this season.</TE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The membership of the International Olympic Committee voted Thursday
to remain in ethical if somewhat begrudging denial of what had for
years been the best perk of being an IOC member: Free trips to cities
vying for the right to stage the Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   By a show of hands, with only six of 114 delegates affirmatively
voting to reinstate visits, the IOC decided to keep in force the ban
on such visits it had enacted in 1999. The ban was put in place as a
response to the worst corruption crisis in IOC history, the scandal
tied to Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   The vote Thursday signaled a victory for IOC President Jacques
Rogge, who has long been opposed to visits. The IOC will select the
site of the 2010 Winter Games next year; it will pick the 2012 Summer
Games city in 2005. It decided Thursday to hold the 2005 session in
Singapore. New York is in the running for the 2012 Games.</LD>
<TE>   The action came on a day in which Rogge, recapping events over his
first full year in office, made it plain that the IOC is now looking
to "consolidate" after a "20-year period of uninterrupted growth."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the focus on downsizing, the IOC intends to vote today
on whether to cut three sports -- baseball, softball and modern
pentathlon -- from the Games as of 2008.</TE>
<TE>   After two decades of virtually non-stop growth, Rogge said
Thursday, the IOC's financial reserves remain "strong," at $140
million, up $27 million over the last year. But in light of terrorism
concerns and the current worldwide economic downturn, he said the IOC
has decided to increase its financial reserves from $140 million to
$192 million "as soon as possible." The money would keep the IOC
afloat if an edition of the Games was partially or wholly canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The vote Thursday on visits to bidding cities probably puts an end
-- at least until 2009, the end of Rogge's first eight-year term --
to further formal discussion on the issue, which has simmered for
three years. "I think it's dead for the time being," longtime
Canadian member Dick Pound said after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC first imposed the ban on bid-city visits just months after
the late 1998 eruption of the Salt Lake scandal, then affirmed the
ban in December, 1999. The Salt Lake scandal was traced directly to
the visits, which dominated the bid-city process from 1986 through
1998; the trips enabled bidders to forge personal contacts with IOC
members. Salt Lake bidders showered members or relatives with more
than $1 million in cash, gifts and other inducements; 10 IOC members
resigned or were expelled in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, the IOC has awarded the Winter Games of 2006 (to
Turin, Italy) and the Summer Games of 2008 (to Beijing) without
member visits. An IOC team tours the cities in the running for the
Games and writes a comprehensive report, which then forms the
research underlying member votes.</TE>
<TE>   Some members complained Thursday that the reports aren't
comprehensive enough.</TE>
<TE>   Others argued that the ban amounts to an unwarranted restriction
of their dignity.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the ban, however, argued that the visits were costly
and unproductive and the risk to the IOC of reinstating visits --
both substantively and PR-wise -- remained too heavy to resume the
practice.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC's ranking vice president, R. Kevan Gosper of Australia,
asserted, "It was the visit process that nearly brought us down in
1999," adding, "I would just urge you, urge you, not to step back
into the past, the past that nearly killed us."</TE>
<TE>   And Tommy Sithole of Zimbabwe, a member of the policy-making
executive board, made perhaps the most passionate plea. He said, "The
Olympics are for the people out there. And those people want to see
us put on the best show on earth -- not talk about our visiting
cities."</TE>

<LD>With Thanksgiving behind us and only two weeks before bowl bids go
out, it's probably time to take our best shots at matching qualified
Pac-10 teams to their affiliated bowls.</LD>
<LD>   Here goes:</LD>
<LD>   Rose: Don't know.</LD>
<TE>   Holiday: Can't say.</TE>
<TE>   Sun: Not sure.</TE>
<TE>   Insight: No insight.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas: Roll of the dice.</TE>
<TE>   Silicon Valley: No clue.</TE>
<TE>   Any other questions?</TE>
<TE>   "I have been director for two years, and been with the bowl for
25," Holiday Bowl executive director Bruce Binkowski said this week,
"and I can't remember being this late in the game and not knowing who
our two teams are. And we probably won't know until Dec. 8."</TE>
<TE>   Life was easier in the old backroom days, when bowls were free to
lock up teams early. The problem was some bowls determined "early" to
mean Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Sun Bowl football chairman John Folmer said he secured
under-the-table agreements with USC and Michigan State to play in his
El Paso game.... in September.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to Michigan State before its fourth game, sat there an
told [coach] George Perles, 'If you don't go to the Rose Bowl, we
want you to come to our place,' " Folmer recalled this week. "He
said, 'You're kidding me,' and I said, 'Well, you have to have a
winning record.' "</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years later, there's a different sort of mess.</TE>
<TE>   With the advent of the bowl championship series and conference
title games played in the first week of December, bowl bids are now
backed up like cars in rush hour traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10, for instance, has arrangements with six bowls but has
yet been able to sign off on one. The problem is bowls are tied to
each other and there's a trickle down effect.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other conferences, Pac-10 teams are bound to specific bowls
based on where they finish in conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 champion goes to the Rose Bowl, with the second-place
school routed to the Holiday. The Sun Bowl gets the No. 3 school,
followed by the Insight, Las Vegas and Silicon Valley bowls.</TE>
<TE>   With the Rose Bowl participants still in doubt, though, the other
bowls can't make their moves.</TE>
<TE>   "As bad as if we feel, waiting for the fallout of the BCS, it has
to be brutal for those on the second echelon," Rose Bowl Chief
Executive Mitch Dorger said. "It's a new system and it's brought some
unanticipated anxiety and uncertainty with it."</TE>
<TE>   Time is money in the bowl business, and bowls disdain having to
wait until Dec. 8 to make their picks, yet nothing can be done until
BCS issues are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   We know it's going to be either Washington State or USC in the
Rose Bowl, probably to face Iowa, but won't know for sure until
Washington State and UCLA meet on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   That game was moved from its original Nov. 16 slot to accommodate
television.</TE>
<TE>   It's also possible USC and Washington State both will make BCS
bowls, which impacts the pecking order.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA beats Washington State, the answer is simple. USC goes to
the Rose Bowl and Washington State is in the Holiday.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington State wins the Rose Bowl bid, and USC does not go to
a BCS game, the Trojans take the Holiday Bowl slot.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington State and USC are lost to BCS games, the Holiday
gets to pick the next best Pac-10 team. However, if UCLA and Arizona
State, currently tied for third, lose their last games, five teams
will be tied with 4-4 records.</TE>
<TE>   What happens then?</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good question," Folmer of the Sun Bowl said. "I don't
know what we'd do. This kills us. It really does."</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Bowl has already been burned by the BCS, in 1998, when a
series of late loses left the bowl without its Big Ten
representative. The Sun Bowl had to fill the slot with Texas
Christian.</TE>
<TE>   It looks as though the Sun Bowl will get Purdue this year, but
must wait on its Pac-10 team. "That's not good," Folmer said. "We
need to get tickets, we need a plan, we need to get people to these
schools."</TE>
<TE>   Call this the result of unintended consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl joined the BCS with the understanding that in years
it was not hosting the national title game, it would match the Pac-10
and Big Ten in the traditional format.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, under BCS rules, that may not be the case. If USC wins a
guaranteed spot in the BCS and the Orange Bowl wants Iowa, the Rose
Bowl may get stuck with the Big 12 champion.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad if that champion is 11-1 Oklahoma, not good if that
champion is four-loss Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 has had to make contingency plans, specifically what to
do with Oregon, the seventh bowl qualified school in a conference
with only six bowl ties?</TE>
<TE>   If the Pac-10 loses two teams to the BCS, Oregon would simply move
up the chain and do no worse than the Silicon Valley Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   If only one conference school is lost to the BCS, then Oregon at
7-5 is looking for a bowl. Just in case, the Pac-10 has made
arrangements with the Seattle Bowl to take the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   Bowls don't like to match schools that met in the regular season
-- the exception this year could be a Holiday Bowl rematch between
USC and Kansas State. "We would not be adverse to that," Binkowski
said. And why not? The Holiday, with a history of producing terrific
matchups, could play host to the nation's two hottest, two-loss
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl, however, probably would not make a rematch between
Washington State and USC, should the Cougars win the Pac-10 title and
the Trojans earn an automatic at-large bid. The situation could arise
if the Orange Bowl, picking first, takes Iowa. The Rose Bowl could
then be left with the Big 12 conference champion.</TE>

<KH>NEW ENGLAND 20, DETROIT 12</KH>
<HD>Home Cooking Is Next for Patriots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Getting a punt blocked, throwing an interception in the red zone and
racking up nine penalties usually is a recipe for defeat. Unless the
opponent is the Detroit Lions.</LD>
<LD>   Antowain Smith ran for 80 yards and a touchdown, and Tedy Bruschi
returned an interception 27 yards for a score as the New England
Patriots beat Detroit, 20-12, Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Today wasn't one of the most attractive wins of the year," said
New England's Troy Brown, who caught 10 passes for 111 yards. "It
will be tough to win playing ugly now, because we've got three
division teams coming up, and we're all fighting for a spot."</LD>
<TE>   The Patriots (7-5) have won four of five games -- after losing
four in a row -- to pull within half a game of AFC East-leading
Miami. The Super Bowl champions play Buffalo, the New York Jets and
the Dolphins at home in December.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions (3-9) had their losing streak extended to four and lost
consecutive games on Thanksgiving for the first time since 1992-93.</TE>
<TE>   After Jason Hanson's fourth field goal cut Detroit's deficit to
20-12 with 9:46 left, the Patriots ran out the clock by driving from
their 19 to the Detroit one. Tom Brady then took a knee to end the
game.</TE>
<TE>   During the 17-play drive, New England was penalized twice on
third-and-seven but converted both times.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, Brady had a chance to add to New England's
10-3 lead after Deion Branch's 63-yard kickoff return, but he threw
an interception to Chris Cash at the Detroit 16. The Lions then
gained 14 yards before punting.</TE>
<TE>   On the Patriots' next drive, Chris Claiborne blocked a punt, but
three plays later, Willie McGinest leaped for an interception at the
Patriot 16.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty even, but we were able to make the right plays at
the right time," Patriot Coach Bill Belichick said. "We converted
turnovers, we picked up some big third-down conversions and we played
good defense."</TE>

<LD>I has been eight years now, and the old coach still searches.</LD>
<LD>   He has helped raise millions of dollars and open nearly two dozen
new labs, and the old coach still schemes.</LD>
<LD>   He makes phone calls. He sends thank-you notes. He beats a drum
until his 79-year-old hands are tired and his new knee and hips are
sore.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't supposed to be like this.</TE>
<TE>   When Ara Parseghian drew something on a blackboard, it always
worked.</TE>
<TE>   It worked for 11 years and two national championships as the
football coach at Notre Dame, then later as a broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   Everything he tried, he won. Everywhere he went, he was carried
home on shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Then, eight years ago, he met something named Niemann-Pick Type C,
a rare and incurable neurological condition that was diagnosed in
three of his grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "The most devastating day of my life," he remembered.</TE>
<TE>   One minute he was a 71-year-old, decorated retiree.</TE>
<TE>   The next minute he was a desperate grandpa fighting for his
family.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fall of 1994. His son Mike and daughter-in-law Cindy
came to him with the bad news, and asked for his help.</TE>
<TE>   The old coach did more than that, helping build one of the
fastest-growing and successful family foundations in the history of
medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Heard of it?</TE>
<TE>   It has been in every major magazine and on every major sports
show.</TE>
<TE>   It has altered the course of study on a little-known disease that
affects between 500-1,000 children in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   It has brought hope in the form of a new drug trial.</TE>
<TE>   But in March 1997, his grandson Michael died at age 9.</TE>
<TE>   And in October 2001, his granddaughter Christa died at age 10.</TE>
<TE>   And today, his last remaining afflicted grandchild Marcia, 14, can
no longer eat without a tube or walk without assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Her symptoms are so advanced, in fact, that she no longer
qualifies for the drug trial that the foundation's research recently
made possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't wish this on anybody," Ara said.</TE>
<TE>   So during this week of the renewal of a rivalry he helped make
famous -- USC versus Notre Dame on Saturday at the Coliseum -- the
old coach is still coaching.</TE>
<TE>   But it has nothing to with football.</TE>
<TE>   All this research that will one day help others ... would it be
too much to ask that it help his own?</TE>
<TE>   "Still looking for the silver bullet, the one silver bullet," he
said. "Looking for anything to save my grandchildren."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was a birthday party last week at the Fiesta bowling center
in Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Did you hear the cheering? Could you feel the smiles?</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Parseghian turned 14.</TE>
<TE>   She couldn't eat the cake. She needed someone to help her stand as
she bowled.</TE>
<TE>   But after several tries, amid much cheering from a couple dozen
friends, she blew out all the candles.</TE>
<TE>   While, across the country in his winter home, in Florida, the fire
in her grandfather burned.</TE>
<TE>   "We sent her some cosmetics, we called to wish her happy birthday
... and you never know whether this will be the last time we can do
that," said Ara, who sees his grandchildren several times a year.
"You wonder why. You wonder how. To have this happen to two such
loving parents. To not even give them a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Those parents, Mike and Cindy, first learned of the disease in
1992, when son Michael's development suddenly slowed in kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   He began falling a lot, his handwriting was poor, something was
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   A series of tests turned up Niemann-Pick Type C, which results in
neurological deterioration by interfering with how cholesterol is
used within cells.</TE>
<TE>   Most children with Niemann-Pick Type C die in adolescence.</TE>
<TE>   When two of Mike and Cindy's three other children also tested
positive, all three younger than 8, they knew they didn't have much
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We got all the information together," Cindy recalled. "Then we
took it to the coach."</TE>
<TE>   Ara could not have been prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has ever struck me like hearing that news," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike and Cindy knew that because the disease afflicted so few
people, they would have no chance of finding a cure if they didn't
start looking themselves.</TE>
<TE>   And they knew their foundation had no chance without the backing
of the man their children called, "Gramps."</TE>
<TE>   "We needed the exposure of his name," Cindy said. "He said he
would do whatever."</TE>
<TE>   After breaking down several times, the old coach composed himself
long enough do to a bunch of whatevers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just about ready to slow things down in my life," Ara said.
"But I knew then I had to get started again."</TE>
<TE>   He leaned on his Notre Dame family, his broadcast friends, his
business contacts. He helped set up golf tournaments and dinners.</TE>
<TE>   He looked up one day to discover not only Notre Dame folks
contributing, but USC folks too. Steve Beuerlein came to one
function. Rodney Peete came to another.</TE>
<TE>   And, long before he was the Notre Dame football coach, Tyrone
Willingham chipped in from Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is now talking about how special Tyrone is," Cindy
said. "We always knew that."</TE>
<TE>   Ara was charged with raising $1 million in four months. He did.
The foundation became successful beyond anyone's dreams.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't stop the nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   While it may eventually save other people's grandchildren, it
couldn't save two of his.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the old coach sells.</TE>
<TE>   "You wonder, why me, why us," Ara said. "But then you do something
I learned from athletics. You move forward. You don't dwell on the
past. You keep moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Singer Amy Grant learned of the foundation through a magazine
article and sang with husband Vince Gill at last year's annual May
fund-raiser. The emcee was Regis Philbin.</TE>
<TE>   "After eight years, we've got lots of people out there spreading
the word," Ara said.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation has become one of the most cost-efficient charities
in the country, with an amazing 95% of all donations going to
directly to research.</TE>
<TE>   All of which has uncovered a possible link between Niemann-Pick
Type C and Alzheimer's, which could lead to more research.</TE>
<TE>   "We started out hoping to save our children," Cindy said softly.
"We now hope to make a difference in other children."</TE>
<TE>   Ara hopes only to see Marcia soon, probably sometime this winter,
a meeting which will be accompanied by Gramps' trademark hand-slap
routine.</TE>
<TE>   "High five ... on the side ... in the hole ... in the toe ... give
me a high one ... give me a low one ... TOO SLOW!"</TE>
<TE>   Before the last slap, he always pulls his hand away and the child
misses.</TE>
<TE>   Then they do it again, and he pulls it away slower, allowing the
giggling child to connect.</TE>
<TE>   "To see their eyes when they think they've beaten Grandpa ... "
Ara said. "It's something I'll never forget."</TE>
<TE>   A small victory perhaps, but a victory nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   The old coach has had plenty. If only his grandbaby Marcia could
have one more.</TE>
<TE>   The Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation is located at 3530
E. Campo Abierto, Suite 105, Tucson, AZ 85718-3327.</TE>

<HD>At USC and Notre Dame, They Take This Game Very Seriously</HD>
<DH>Big from the start in 1926, the storied rivalry has been
steeped in memorable moments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are singular moments of individual glory, so many of them. Six
touchdowns in a game by USC's Anthony Davis. A 56-yard, game-winning
punt return by Notre Dame's Tim Brown.</LD>
<LD>   USC falling behind 24-0, then scoring 55 unanswered points. Notre
Dame playing its starters until the bitter end, to preserve the
shutout in a 51-0 win.</LD>
<LD>   National titles have been won and lost; players have made
themselves Heisman Trophy winners. Jersey colors have been changed,
from Notre Dame's traditional blue to kelly green, in hopes of
gaining a psychological edge, as in a notable 1977 game in South
Bend, Ind. And then there's that Trojan white horse, the sight of
which nearly made a Notre Dame coach physically ill.</LD>
<TE>   USC versus Notre Dame is arguably college football's greatest
rivalry. The schools will play, Saturday afternoon in the Coliseum,
for the 74th time and for the 57th consecutive year. Notre Dame leads
the series 42-26-5, but those 26 Trojan victories are more than any
other team has against the Fighting Irish. And Notre Dame's 42 wins
are the most by any USC opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The rivalry aside, for the first time since 1988, when Notre Dame
was ranked No. 1 and USC No. 2 in the country, this game has huge
meaning for both teams. The winner should receive an invitation to
one of the nation's four biggest -- and richest -- postseason bowl
games.</TE>
<TE>   That's how it is with these two teams, each always expecting
greatness, from themselves and from each other.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will also earn a shillelagh trophy that, according to
legend, was flown from Ireland by Howard Hughes' pilot. There are 42
emerald-studded shamrocks to represent the Notre Dame wins and 26
ruby-decorated Trojan heads for USC's victories.</TE>
<TE>   No fewer than 11 Heisman Trophy winners -- the award goes to
college football's best player -- have been produced by USC and Notre
Dame. In 14 of the games, one of the teams went on to win a national
title. Twice USC, in the last scheduled game of the season, has upset
the Irish and cost them the national title.</TE>
<TE>   The second time came in 1964. Trailing 17-0 at halftime, USC
rallied to win, 20-17. The game-winning touchdown came with 1 minute,
33 seconds left on a fourth-down, 15-yard pass from Craig Fertig to
Rod Sherman after defender Tony Carey had fallen down.</TE>
<TE>   Fertig, a broadcaster for USC games on television, paid a visit to
the Trojans' practice Monday. "I busted into their meeting," Fertig
said, "and I was wearing a green sweater with a shamrock over my
heart. I was a wild man. Coach [Norm] Chow [a USC assistant coach]
told me to settle down a little bit because it was only Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's a big game, it's always been a big game, it always will
be a big game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to explain, but if you're an SC person you will always
have to play Notre Dame and if you're a Notre Dame person, you'll
always have to play SC."</TE>
<TE>   This rivalry is about so much more than a trophy. It is about
history.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got to USC," said Davis, who scored his six touchdowns
against the Fighting Irish in 1972, "I studied about the past games.
Did you know the first game was in 1926 and it was started by two
women?"</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   USC's traditional version of the story is that Marion Wilson,
whose husband, Gwynn, was the Trojans' athletics team manager (much
like today's athletic director), was on a train to Chicago along with
the Notre Dame team, determined to convince Notre Dame Coach Knute
Rockne that a series of games between USC and Notre Dame would be a
good idea.</TE>
<TE>   Rockne thought his team was traveling too much and didn't like the
idea of hauling the Irish halfway across the country on the train.
But Marion was in a compartment with Rockne's wife, Bonnie. The women
hit it off. Bonnie told Knute she thought the game was a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   And a legendary series was born.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's no truth to that story," said Murray Sperber, author
of "Shake Down the Thunder," a history of Notre Dame football. "What
happened was that the Los Angeles Coliseum had been recently built.
USC people came to South Bend and offered a huge amount of money and
Notre Dame accepted."</TE>
<TE>   It is the nation's greatest intersectional football rivalry,
according to historian Bernie Kish, director of the National College
Football Hall of Fame. Since 1926, except for three years during
World War II, the Fighting Irish have traveled some 2,000 miles to
Los Angeles or the Trojans have traveled a similar distance to the
Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Sperber called the team's train travel west "a pilgrimage. The
Fighting Irish train would go south to New Orleans, to Houston,
across Arizona, to places with large Catholic populations, and when
they came back they would go through San Francisco and Denver and
take a long time at each of those stops. They were given parades and
parties and it was an amazing journey."</TE>
<TE>   The maturation of the rivalry, in many ways, matched the
maturation of this country.</TE>
<TE>   "In the days before there were dozens of games on television, this
game was the only game on TV all weekend. All football fans watched,"
Kish said. "And people in the Midwest would see the Coliseum and the
palm trees and the movie stars and people in Los Angeles would see
the cold and the snow and all the Catholic history at Notre Dame."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930s, Sperber said, "Notre Dame really liked going to the
coast. They'd be feted by movie stars. Bing Crosby started coming to
the games and he would throw a party and it was a great chance for
Notre Dame to raise money. There were a lot of Hollywood movies and
musicals made where USC and Notre Dame were featured prominently. It
became a cultural thing as much as a sports rivalry."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not the cultural significance that will draw 92,000 to
the Coliseum Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   It's the hope of seeing history as it happens, of seeing another
magical game, a special play, a myth-making performance.</TE>
<TE>   The first game in 1926 drew 74,378, then the most ever to see
Notre Dame play.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Rockne called the 13-12 Irish win "the greatest game I
ever saw."</TE>
<TE>   USC got its first win against the Irish in 1928, 27-14, and Rockne
wasn't happy. Notre Dame had conducted an open practice in Tucson and
then a day later read about his plays in Los Angeles newspapers. "It
serves me right to be nice to certain sportswriters," Rockne said
after the loss.</TE>
<TE>   USC's first two away games in the series -- at Chicago's Soldier
Field in 1927 and 1929 -- drew crowds of 120,000 and 112,912, the
largest ever to watch USC play and two of the three largest to watch
Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   When USC won at South Bend for the first time in 1931, rallying
from a 14-0 deficit for a 16-14 win and ending a 26-game Notre Dame
winning streak, the national champion Trojans were welcomed home by a
parade through the streets of Los Angeles that drew 300,000.</TE>
<TE>   Fertig, one of the heroes of the 1964 game for USC, said his
father was so mad at him for taking a recruiting trip to Notre Dame
that "he didn't speak to me for three days. He had given me a music
box that played [the USC song] 'Fight On.' So after three days, he
comes into my room. He didn't say good night or go to hell or
anything. He just flipped up the top of that music box and on came
'Fight On.' I understood."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Fertig was in Chicago on the day before USC played at
Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at lunch," Fertig said, "and two guys come up and say, 'You
no good so and so,' and they're holding up a picture from the Los
Angeles Times, 1964, and it's of Sherman catching that pass. It turns
out they were friends of Carey, the guy who had fallen down. So I
invited them to eat lunch with us and told them to call Carey. They
did. He wouldn't come."</TE>
<TE>   After each of his six touchdowns in USC's 45-23 win in 1972, Davis
had done a little shake and shimmy end-zone dance.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, when USC went to South Bend, Davis said, the deep
meaning of the rivalry was obvious. Both teams were undefeated and
emotions were high.</TE>
<TE>   "We got off the bus," Davis said, "and I was hanging in effigy....
I saw pictures of me all over campus, taped to the ground, so the
students could walk on my face." Notre Dame won the game, 23-14, and
its ninth national title.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1974, in what Joe Doyle, a South Bend Tribune writer and
student of Notre Dame history, called the greatest 17 minutes of
football he had ever seen, Davis starred as USC scored 55 straight
points and turned a 24-0 first-half deficit into a 55-24 win.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle, 82, said, "It was amazing football USC played. It wasn't
that Notre Dame was turning the ball over or playing badly."</TE>
<TE>   It was after that game that Ara Parseghian, who would soon
announce he was quitting as Irish head coach, moaned that he was
"damned tired" of seeing Traveler, USC's white steed, high-step it
around the stadium track after each USC touchdown. "Could you blame
me?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle, who will be in the Coliseum Saturday, rattles off
highlights as if he were reading scores on a newscast.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1966, Notre Dame won 51-0 to win the national title. In 1970,
both were good teams and there was a tremendous rainstorm at the
Coliseum. It started in the second quarter when USC had a slight
lead. But Joe Theismann went out and had a tremendous game. He threw
58 passes, completed 33 for 526 yards. USC won, 38-28, though."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Haden, a Rhodes scholar who played at USC and has broadcast
Notre Dame games, said the length of the series, its constancy, is
what sets the USC-Notre Dame rivalry apart.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always thought of this game as one of the few that is part
of a long continuum," Haden said. "I went to the game with my father.
I've taken my kids to it and I anticipate my kids taking their kids
to it. It's a constant in an ever-changing sports landscape."</TE>
<TE>   Haden came from a Notre Dame family and his first memory is of the
1964 game. "I remember going to Thanksgiving Mass with the Notre Dame
team," Haden said. "My father was so excited. We sat up in the
nosebleed section, Row 86 or something, and watched Craig Fertig ruin
Notre Dame's perfect season and national championship hopes."</TE>
<TE>   Another memorable game was in 1977, when Notre Dame Coach Dan
Devine secretly ordered the Irish green jerseys -- instead of blue --
just for the USC game. Other than the Irish captains, none of the
players knew what they'd be wearing until the team had come back to
the locker room after pre-game warmups.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish returned to the Notre Dame Stadium turf to be greeted by
stunned silence, then ear-shattering noise.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame romped, 49-19, for Devine's only win over the Trojans
in his six seasons as coach.</TE>
<TE>   The late Marv Goux, known as Mr. Trojan until his death earlier
this year, was both a player and coach for USC.</TE>
<TE>   His widow, Patti, who will participate in the coin toss Saturday,
said her husband once described his walk up the tunnel at Notre Dame.
"Marv said the tunnel was fairly narrow, then you walk out and the
opponents are right there..... You're looking at the field and
there's the sun shining on the cardinal and gold leaves of autumn."</TE>
<TE>   Patti laughed at this, Marv making the South Bend leaves into USC
talismans.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Patti said, Marv went to USC practice during Notre Dame
week. "Marv had formed a real bond with [first-year USC Coach] Pete
Carroll," Patti said. "Marv talked to the team and to Pete and tried
to convey the meaning of this game. He told them about going up the
tunnel and the leaves.</TE>
<TE>   "When the game is in South Bend, kickoff is always 11:30 our time.
About 10 a.m., the phone rang and it was Pete. He had the cell phone
in his hand. He told Marv he was walking out the tunnel. 'I had to
tell you,' Carroll told Goux, 'it's just like you said it would be.'
That meant the world to Marv."</TE>
<TE>   Fertig said the magnitude of the rivalry was never clearer than
after that 1964 game.</TE>
<TE>   "After we won that game," he said, "we had a team party. A guy
that worked for the L.A. Times, he had collected newspapers from all
over the world.</TE>
<TE>   He had papers from London, Frankfurt, Munich, Paris. And on the
front page of all those papers, there was the story about USC and
Notre Dame. I still have those papers."</TE>

<LD>You're probably going to have your fill of football during this
holiday weekend, so you may want to be more selective than you were
at the Thanksgiving Day dinner table.</LD>
<LD>   But one thing you don't want to miss is today's Colorado-Nebraska
halftime show. There'll be a 3 1/2-minute feature promoting
Saturday's USC-Notre Dame telecast that is worthy of a full-length
movie.</LD>
<LD>   It's about Scott Delgadillo, a San Diego native who for some
reason became a Notre Dame football fan when he was 4. He made his
mother buy him a Notre Dame cap when he was 5. During his Pop Warner
days, he dreamed about playing for the Irish someday.</LD>
<TE>   In January 2000, when he was 13, he came down with a cold he
couldn't shake. The diagnosis was leukemia. A month later,
representatives from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a national
organization that grants wishes to children with life-threatening
illnesses, came to visit Scott.</TE>
<TE>   His wish was to attend a Notre Dame game.</TE>
<TE>   The wish was granted. The game selected was one against Purdue in
September 2000. Scott was invited to the pep rally in the campus
arena the night before and was also asked if he'd like to speak.</TE>
<TE>   There were 12,000 people jammed into the arena. The entire team
was there. Then-coach Bob Davie was there.</TE>
<TE>   So were cheerleaders, the leprechaun, and Dan Ruettiger, the
real-life Rudy.</TE>
<TE>   The place quieted when Scott, his head bald from chemotherapy,
stepped to the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   He talked about fighting and inspiration and never giving up.
There was barely a dry eye in the house by the time he was finished.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame went out the next day and beat Purdue and its star
quarterback Drew Brees, 23-21, on a last-second field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Scott was awarded the game ball.</TE>
<TE>   Scott made a lot of friends while he was in South Bend, Ind., and
two in particular.</TE>
<TE>   One was Joey Getherall, then a senior wide receiver. The other was
Shane Walton, a senior cornerback on this year's team. Walton is also
from the San Diego area, having attended the Bishop's School in La
Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Getherall caught two touchdown passes in regulation and also the
clinching touchdown pass in overtime of a 34-31 victory over Air
Force in 2000. He sent a photo of the winning touchdown to Scott with
an accompanying letter saying he was playing for him on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas Day of 2000, Scott's cancer returned and he spent 30
days at Children's Hospital in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   After returning home following the Fiesta Bowl, Walton became a
regular visitor. Scott, or Scotty as Walton and other called him, had
a new best friend.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 29, 2001, Scotty Delgadillo died at age 14.</TE>
<TE>   Buried with him were Getherall's No. 18 jersey -- 18 was the
number Scott wore in Pop Warner -- and Walton's No. 42 jersey.</TE>
<TE>   There is a web site, www.inmemoryofscott.com, that tells the
story, complete with photos.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe some day they'll be a movie titled simply "Scotty."</TE>
<TE>   When ABC called the Notre Dame sports information office looking
for a feature to promote the USC-Notre Dame game, the person on the
other end of the phone, Lisa Nelson Mushett, didn't have to think
very long.</TE>
<TE>   The Scott Delgadillo story was a natural.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Laurie White and a crew went to Notre Dame last week,
then on to San Diego for interviews with the Delgadillo family.</TE>
<TE>   The person who organized Scott's visit to South Bend in 2000 is
Jennifer Laiber, an administrative assistant in the Notre Dame public
relations and information department. Laiber has become so close with
the Delgadillo family -- Henry, Carmen and 18-year-old Eric -- that
she is spending the Thanksgiving holiday weekend with them.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Delgadillo said the family will watch the feature on
television today, then travel to Los Angeles for Saturday's game.</TE>
<TE>   And you know who they'll be cheering for.</TE>
<TE>   Some Golf Too</TE>
<TE>   If you need a break from football, there's always golf.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has the $1-million Conagra Foods Skins Game on Saturday and
Sunday, featuring a field of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, the two
top-ranked players in the world, and Mark O'Meara and Fred Couples.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Mike Tirico, who will work the event at Landmark Golf Club
in Indio with Curtis Strange and on-course reporter Andy North, said:
"Anytime you have the top two players in the world, it is a good
event. If you factor in two other world-class players, plus all four
wearing microphones, it makes for an exciting weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Said Strange: "Tiger and Phil play so aggressively, you could have
the most exciting Skins Game in recent memory."</TE>
<TE>   LPGA Wrap-Up</TE>
<TE>   It was a good year for the LPGA, which concluded its season last
weekend with the ADT Championship, formerly called the LPGA Tour
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Libba Galloway, LPGA senior vice president, said the number of
viewers on broadcast networks increased 24%, averaging 1.314
households per telecast, and cable showed a 22% increase with an
average of 341,000 households.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   ABC is televising the USC-Notre Dame game to 70% of the country.
The remaining 30% get Florida-Florida State. ... Keith Jackson and
Dan Fouts will announce USC-Notre Dame. ... The Game Show Network's
"Whammy!" will be part of the halftime show at the Coliseum, and fans
attending the game will be given Game Show Network tokens good for
prizes. ... NBC offers the Bayou Classic between Grambling State and
Southern at 11 a.m. Saturday. This is another halftime show you won't
want to miss. The battle of the bands is always a highlight.</TE>
<TE>   CBS has a college football special today, "Dell Presents College
Football's 10 Greatest Players," at 10:30 a.m. Tim Brando will serve
as host of the one-hour show. ... Fox Sports Net could have done a
better job of showing the final play of last Saturday's overtime game
between Washington and Washington State. Was it a forward pass or a
backward lateral? ... The Nov. 21 game between Miami and Pittsburgh
drew a 4.2 national rating and 3.369 million viewers, making it the
most-watch Thursday night game on ESPN since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   As if UCLA fans haven't already been punished enough, they can
watch the Bruin basketball team play Duke in the Wooden Tradition at
Indianapolis at 10 a.m. Saturday on CBS. ... Laker fans in San Diego
have a legitimate complaint about the NBA League Pass. Laker games
are blacked out in San Diego because it is considered part of the
L.A. market. "Why in the wide world of sports is San Diego subject to
blackouts when we don't get KCAL," wrote reader Tom Jensen. "It makes
absolutely no sense." ... ESPN has picked up "Beg, Borrow and Deal"
for a second season. ... ESPN is planning to produce a four-part
mini-series on the Munich Olympics massacre, to be shown before the
2004 Summer Games. It seems that topic already has been well covered.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   Sports talk radio stations KXTA (1150) and San Diego's XTRA (690)
will merge into one "super station" on Dec. 16. It's known that Jim
Rome and Lee Hamilton will be part of the lineup. Surveys have been
conducted to determine who else gets picked up.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine that "Kiley and Booms" would win out over the
"Loose Cannons." In fact, it's hard to imagine "Kiley and Booms"

<TE>   Someone identifying himself as Ed Kezirian, the towel-twirling
UCLA assistant football coach, called into the Trojan postgame show
on KMPC (1540) last Saturday and accused USC of running up the score.
It was figured out later it was an impostor.</TE>

<KH>No. 6 USC vs No. 7 NOTRE DAME</KH>
<HD>Carroll Sells</HD>
<DH>He has quickly convinced skeptics he's the perfect coach
for USC</DH>

<LD>Shortly after noon, Pete Carroll leaves his office and hurries
outside to where an assistant waits with a golf cart. There is much
to do in preparation for Saturday's game but, at the moment, he must
head across campus to speak to a weekly gathering of boosters.</LD>
<LD>   A student calls out as he rides past and, the moment he steps off
the cart, a small girl stops him for an autograph. Her mother chimes
in: "If she were older and you were younger, she'd want you forever."
Finally Carroll strides into the luncheon and all those well-heeled
fans erupt in raucous applause.</LD>
<LD>   It has been a while since a football coach was this popular on the
USC campus and Carroll knows it. "This is pretty sweet," he says.</LD>
<TE>   Fewer than two years after arriving to a chorus of skeptics --
Could a guy with a lukewarm record in the NFL, a guy almost two
decades removed from the college game, do the job? -- Carroll has
returned USC to a hint of its glory days.</TE>
<TE>   A big win over UCLA last week pushed the Trojans to 9-2 and No. 6
in the polls, their best standing this late in the season since 1988.
A victory over Notre Dame at the Coliseum on Saturday could nudge
them into a coveted bowl championship series game.</TE>
<TE>   It's only one season. Carroll and everyone else in the athletic
department repeats this mantra. But alumni and fans, even players,
find it hard not to be giddy over the reversal of fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so much fun," says cornerback Marcell Allmond, a junior
who has never been on a winning team until now. "This is what Coach
Carroll has brought."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What Carroll brought to USC, at first, were doubts.</TE>
<TE>   Fans on the West Coast knew him vaguely as a coach who had been to
the playoffs but had been fired from the New York Jets and New
England Patriots. They knew his image in the media as smart but
quirky, mixing football with psychology and philosophy, too friendly
with players, too soft.</TE>
<TE>   "He never got the respect he deserved in the NFL," says University
of Pittsburgh Coach Walt Harris, a longtime friend. "I always told
him, Pete, you'd be a great college coach."</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at USC in December 2000, Carroll pledged to adjust -- not
change -- his style. He proved it immediately, gathering his team at
the Coliseum one night for a surprise tug-of-war.</TE>
<TE>   Players learned they could talk to him about their families and
girlfriends. He liked to play catch after practice and rock music
often reverberated from his office.</TE>
<TE>   "The coaches can be sitting in a meeting room, in the deepest
discussion about the most important thing, but the second a player
walks in the door, the discussion stops," says assistant Ed Orgeron,
a holdover from the previous staff of Paul Hackett. "The players know
they can talk to us."</TE>
<TE>   The key to Carroll is his belief that he cannot succeed in the
traditional roles of coach as tyrant or chief executive directing the
team from on high. He operates face-to-face, doubling as defensive
coordinator because it gives him an opportunity to work hands-on,
teaching technique, proving himself daily.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it sounds like a cliche, but he has this great
relationship with his players," cornerback Darrell Rideaux says.
"They want to play hard for him."</TE>
<TE>   The defense is an example. Though the Trojans have All-American
safety Troy Polamalu, they had to replace much of the secondary and
lost standout tackle Shaun Cody to injury. The squad has
overachieved, ranking fifth in the nation against the run and 14th
overall.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't so much Xs and O's because I think Paul Hackett is as
good at Xs and O's as anyone," Washington State Coach Mike Price
says. "I think it's chemistry."</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer agrees. "He brought his intensity and his love and
his passion for the game," the USC quarterback says. "That has really
rubbed off ... everybody is fired up, jumping up and down on the
sideline. Guys on the field are happy, flying around and slapping
each other. That's Coach Carroll."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps his friends were right -- his buoyant persona is better
suited to the youth and enthusiasm of the college game. Offensive
coordinator Norm Chow explains: "It's refreshing and it's never going
to get old because the players keep turning over."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll sees another benefit to his new surroundings. He claims to
have been handcuffed in New England by a front office that dictated
the roster. Whether or not this contributed to his woes -- he was
accused of losing control of the team -- Carroll relishes the
authority to recruit players and discipline them without having to
yell or grab facemasks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're out of control or doing something wrong, he pulls you
aside," offensive lineman Lenny Vandermade says. "He lets you know
that if you keep doing that, you won't play."</TE>
<TE>   This season, in the statistical categories most closely linked to
discipline, the Trojans are committing seven penalties a game and
rank ninth in the nation in turnover margin, both significant
improvements over the previous staff. And the coach has been free to
tinker with his lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Grootegoed was switched from safety to linebacker and, though
undersized, leads the team in tackles. Allmond, a receiver his first
three seasons, has helped plug the hole at cornerback, intercepting
his first pass against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, though Sultan McCullough ranked third in the
conference in rushing, Carroll decided to start Justin Fargas at
tailback. The switch was so unexpected that some players did not know
about it until the offense huddled before the first snap.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas responded by running for 139 yards in a critical victory at
Oregon. Carroll downplays the move -- "A gut feeling ... sometimes
they work, sometimes they don't" -- but does not take his newfound
autonomy for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the control," he says. "It's so much easier to coach the
way I want to."</TE>
<TE>   Still, reviving a beleaguered USC program required one more piece
to the puzzle. Oddly enough, the problem was offense, which was
supposed to be the team's strength.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Carroll inherit Palmer, McCullough and receiver
Kareem Kelly, he paid $300,000 a year for Chow, who spent 27 years
grooming quarterbacks at Brigham Young. As Price says, "it was the
right kind of fit ... he went out and got an offensive coordinator
who knows how to throw the ball as well as anybody in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Trojans finished as the worst offensive team in the
conference last season. Even when a late winning streak put them in
the Las Vegas Bowl, they suffered an embarrassing 10-6 loss to Utah,
a game in which Palmer et al looked hapless.</TE>
<TE>   So Carroll and Chow made changes.</TE>
<TE>   The drop-back offense was shelved in the off-season, replaced by
more play-action passes, more rollouts. Alex Gibbs, the Denver Bronco
offensive line coach, was brought in to share his philosophy on
blocking.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, a revamped line has helped the Trojans add 34 yards a
game on the ground, boosting their average to a respectable 129.
That, in turn, has helped Palmer sell those play-action fakes, giving
him time to find open receivers.</TE>
<TE>   USC ranks 10th in the nation in passing and 16th in total offense,
statistics that have made the quarterback a Heisman Trophy candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The offense has also benefited from several of those freshmen
Carroll gets to recruit. He loves traveling around the country,
sitting in living rooms, trying to persuade young athletes. Again,
it's the eye-to-eye contact. Last spring, he attracted one of the
nation's top-rated classes.</TE>
<TE>   Winston Justice starts at tackle. Tailback Hershel Dennis scored
on a long run against UCLA. Most significant, receiver Mike Williams
has changed the dynamic of the passing game, a big and physical
counterpoint to Kelly and Keary Colbert.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I love," Carroll says. "I'm in charge. I can go get
the players I need."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stereo is tuned to a rock 'n' roll station, the Rolling Stones
thumping from speakers, when Carroll returns to his office after the
booster luncheon. Several people wait in the lobby but his time is
tight.</TE>
<TE>   "Notre Dame," he says. "We've got to keep this thing rolling."</TE>
<TE>   It seems as if the coach is making up for lost time. Carroll
believes he could have won more games in New England if given the
freedom to run the team his way. Instead, after leading the Patriots
to the playoffs twice, he was fired when they fell to 8-8 in his
third season.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing year was spent away from coaching, rethinking all he
had done right and wrong, visiting with Harris and others to get a
sense of the college game. By the fall 2000, he was prepared for
another shot.</TE>
<TE>   USC talked to bigger names -- Oregon State's Dennis Erickson,
Oregon's Mike Bellotti, then-San Diego Charger coach Mike Riley --
but athletic department officials rave about Carroll's interview. "I
saw someone who was a teacher and knew his craft," Athletic Director
Mike Garrett said. "I thought, 'This guy is pretty good.' "</TE>
<TE>   Outsiders had their doubts.</TE>
<TE>   Alumni grumbled. The media portrayed Carroll as a twice-fired
retread, an NFL veteran out of touch with the college game. Two years
later, he has a chance to say "I told you so" but declines with a
shrug.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all right," he says. "I expected all that."</TE>
<TE>   Of greater concern is Notre Dame's sturdy defense. And, with
signing day drawing nearer, Carroll has another recruiting class to
think about. There is too much work to be done -- too much fun -- for
him to be waylaid by the hoopla of this current success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just one season," he says. But he says it with a tone of
confidence, the manner of a man who believes he has paid his dues and
knows exactly where he is heading.</TE>

<HD>Prosecution Alone Is No Answer to Gang Crime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter W. Greenwood</AU>
<BD>Peter W. Greenwood is the former director of Rand's
criminal justice program and principal investigator for the
Hollenbeck Cease-Fire Project. He now is the head of a private
consulting firm.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent streak of gang-related homicides does not represent a new
kind of problem for Angelenos. We have been dealing with this sort of
thing for more than 30 years. In fact, we exported it to other parts
of the country.</LD>
<LD>   So should we, as Police Chief William J. Bratton says, get mad
about it now? Of course. But there are other things that we probably
should be even madder about.</LD>
<LD>   Our elected officials and law enforcement agencies have developed
a number of programs for dealing with gang violence. They do
reasonably well prosecuting gang killers once they are caught.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the district attorney's hard-core gang unit, which handles
these cases, serves as a model for many jurisdictions in other
states. The gang injunction process, developed by the city and
district attorneys, appears to have positive effects on crime and
citizens' sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   We have done less well, however, at the front end of the problem.
Not a single prevention program developed in Los Angeles County has
been identified nationally as effective. And while prosecutions of
gang members arrested for murders are successful, an unacceptably
large number of homicides remain unsolved, and the documented effects
of our other costly crime prevention programs are not encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Project Clear is a series of joint efforts involving
all the local law enforcement and corrections agencies in the county.
It has received millions of dollars from state and local agencies
over the last few years to enhance enforcement efforts in designated
gang-affected neighborhoods. But it has never demonstrated consistent
results.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, L.A. Bridges, the Los Angeles City Council's
multimillion-dollar prevention program that attempted to link
community-based service providers to gang-affected schools, has not
succeeded in improving community safety or reducing violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   If we include all of the money that the Los Angeles County
Probation Department spends on programs and strategies that have been
ineffective elsewhere, it is enough to make taxpayers very mad
indeed.</TE>
<TE>   A number of effective programs have been developed across the
United States in the areas of prevention and intervention with
at-risk youth, yet few of them are used in Los Angeles. Even when we
do adopt a proven program, we often mess it up.</TE>
<TE>   To wit: In 1998, the National Institute of Justice provided
funding for a team of Rand researchers to help the LAPD replicate and
test the Boston Gun Project, a promising gang intervention program,
in its Hollenbeck Division. The primary goal of the project was to
declare and enforce a cease-fire among gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The first step was to develop an interagency team to analyze
recent cases. The analysis found that about 75% of the homicides in
Hollenbeck involved gang members, and about half were revenge
killings between members of rival gangs.</TE>
<TE>   What did the project do about it? For more than two years, LAPD
detectives and county probation officers developed network diagrams
and membership lists for all of the active gangs in the southern part
of the division. Local prosecutors developed faster procedures to
handle cease-fire violations. Detailed criteria were developed for
determining when a violation of the cease-fire had occurred. However,
after all this planning and preparation, the project was never made
operational because of competing priorities for staffing within the
LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   In order for Los Angeles to benefit from the millions of dollars
now being invested by foundations and federal research agencies in
the development and testing of effective crime prevention programs,
our local officials need to be more selective about the programs they
adopt.</TE>
<TE>   They also need to start holding one another accountable for the
effects they achieve.</TE>

<HD>With Friends Like These</HD>
<DH>U.S. runs a big risk by wooing the ayatollahs as an Iraq
war looms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James P. Pinkerton</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail address: pinkerto@ix .netcom.com</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are you ready for another alliance with an ayatollah?</LD>
<LD>   Not long ago, Americans went on secret missions to Tehran,
attempting to strike deals with "moderate" Islamic clergymen. Today,
we hold meetings with them around the world.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe this will work better. Maybe not.</LD>
<TE>   For months now, representatives of six Iraqi exile groups have
been haggling over a deal for governing a post-Hussein Iraq. The
negotiations haven't been going well. The Associated Press reports
that the Iraqi factions are "split along ethnic, tribal, religious
and political lines," adding that "infighting over who would be in
charge in the face of regime change is threatening the plan, to be
presented at a conference meant to highlight unity among Saddam's
foes." As Fawaz Gerges of Sarah Lawrence University observes: "The
closer we get to a deadline for a military invasion ... the questions
of leadership, alliances, stakes and who gets what have intensified
to an almost impossible degree."</TE>
<TE>   OK, that's politics for you. But what raises eyebrows -- and
should raise hackles -- is the participation of the Supreme Council
for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, led by Ayatollah Mohammed Bakr Hakim,
an Iraqi Shiite cleric who has lived in exile in Iran for the last
two decades. Yup, that's right. We're back to bargaining with "good"
ayatollahs again.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they might not really be good. That was the lesson of
the Iranian arms-for-hostages saga, which began in 1985 when the
Reagan administration sent a covert mission to Tehran. But the
Iranians played us for suckers, blowing the cover off the scheme the
following year. The resulting Iran-Contra scandal kept an independent
counsel in Washington busy for the next seven years.</TE>
<TE>   It's worth remembering that the key ally of the U.S. in that
ill-fated mission was Israel. The Israelis had their reasons for
trying to deal with Iran; they knew the Iranians were the ancient
enemy of the Arabs, and so they figured they could make common cause
with the ayatollahs. But just as Washington failed to win friends and
influence Persians, so did Israel. To this day, the Tehran government
is a sworn enemy of the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for all their savvy, the Israelis have suffered the same
shortsightedness as the Americans; that is, a myopic misperception of
the underlying dynamic within the Muslim world -- the rise of
fundamentalist Islam. They made that blunder in the territories they
occupied after the Six-Day War of 1967.</TE>
<TE>   In that Cold War time, the Palestine Liberation Organization was
outwardly secular and pro-Soviet. So the Israelis adopted a
divide-and-conquer strategy, quietly helping Islamic groups, such as
Hamas -- the word means "fervor" in Arabic -- figuring that the
Islamists would clash with the secularists and communists. And they
did clash. But then came the rub: The Islamists won, and they were
not grateful to the Israelis for helping them.</TE>
<TE>   Today, secularist Yasser Arafat sits in the rubble of his compound
in the West Bank, while fundamentalists provide most of the human
fodder for anti-Israeli attacks. In the words of Lloyd Green, a
Middle East advisor to Republican presidential campaigns,
"Repeatedly, the Americans and Israelis have attempted to manipulate
Islamic militants, ultimately paid a high price, and been greeted by
unintended and unwelcomed consequences."</TE>
<TE>   So what could happen if we repeat the process yet again, invading
Iraq with the help of Islamists such as Bakr Hakim? For his part, he
says he's happy to have the U.S. remove Saddam Hussein, who is, among
other things, a secularist. But then, of course, the Americans must
leave. "Iraqis are able to manage their own lives," he told the New
York Times. "I see no need for American forces to remain in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   But wait a second. Wasn't the point to stick around to make sure
the Iraqis behave? Do we really want to repeat the Israeli
experience, which is to go after a secular foe and see it replaced by
an even more zealous foe?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, with the likes of Bakr Hakim running Baghdad, we might
find it costly to remain in Iraq. After all, it was Bakr Hakim's
fellow Shiites, backed by the Iranians, who pioneered the
suicide-bombing tactic, driving both the U.S. and Israel out of
Lebanon in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Can the Shiites do it again in Iraq? At the rate we're going,
we'll find out.</TE>

<BD>Luke Sullivan, twice named by Adweek as one of the top
10 copywriters in the U.S., is author of "Hey Whipple, Squeeze This"
(Adweek Books, 1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My mother, a dyed-in-the-wool Minnesota Democrat, is sitting across
the breakfast table from me. She's reading the paper and comes across
an ad for the big after-Thanksgiving sale at the Mall of America.</LD>
<LD>   "How can people even go to that place?" she laments. "It's just a
... just a monument to capitalism!"</LD>
<LD>   She's my mom, so what can I tell her? I wish I could say, "Ma,
that dress you're wearing? Did you, um, grow it or something? And
those shoes, did you whittle those? No, you bought 'em, Mom, with
money, in a store. That's capitalism, and it's OK."</LD>
<TE>   Exactly why does everyone get so disdainful of shopping this time
of year?</TE>
<TE>   The Thanksgiving dishes are barely in the sink and -- before the
first boozy uncle can tether his blimp to the sofa -- the "Christmas
has just become so commercialized" chorus begins.</TE>
<TE>   Shopping is suddenly "bad." And why? We've been coming out of
stores all year long, teetering under piles of merchandise that would
drop a Sherpa. Eleven straight months of spend, spend, spend, but
have a turkey drumstick, watch a football game and boom -- the
nation's stores form their own axis of evil.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody seems to have forgotten the long Fourth of July weekend
and that three-day AmEx bender we all went on at Home Depot. And when
it was over, I don't remember any hair-shirt whining about "who can
celebrate national independence anymore, what with lines this long to
buy a grill? Kinda makes a fella forget what the Declaration of
Independence really stands for."</TE>
<TE>   And did we all just forget the high-kicking conga lines that
formed in front of every bank in the nation an hour after Alan
Greenspan changed his mind another quarter of a percent? Where was
all this high-minded hand-wringing during the refinancing orgy? There
was no "I tell ya, homeownership has just gotten so crass I can't
even mow the lawn." Didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   But so here we are again at that one time of year when our
nation's superego puts on its Annual Self-Hatred Christmas Special,
when the apologists line up to lament the small excesses of the
world's strongest economy, and through it all we'll hear one Scrooge
after another putting the spin on the Ghost of Christmas Past: "It
wasn't like this when I was a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Oh hush, it was exactly like this when we were kids. The presents
were geekier, yes, and the lights on the tree were the big hot kind
you could smell from upstairs. Other than that, it was exactly the
same.</TE>
<TE>   As a child of the '50s, I personally recall some serious
merchandise-worship happening under the tree. It may not have been a
Nintendo Game Cube I was opening, but don't try to tell me I was on
some higher spiritual plane as I ripped through the 1959 wrapping
paper, my teeth gritting in full Merchandise Frenzy. "Shut up,
everybody! It's a Daniel Boone raccoon hat, and now it's mine!"</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it. Stuff is fun. And stores are where you get stuff.
But the puritanical gene, though recessive, still runs strong in our
nation. A penny saved is a penny earned, but now a penny spent is the
top rung on the ladder down to hell. But the fact is, ours is a
species that runs on commerce. And whether your tribe happens to
trade pelts or euros, the rites of celebration have always involved a
bit of excess consumption. At history's very first celebration, I'll
bet Grandpa Homo Sapiens bought drinks for everyone in Oldevai Gorge,
yelled "kill the fatted calf!" and woke up to a cave that was a
complete mess.</TE>
<TE>   So go ye forth, Americans, I say, and spend without guilt. It's
part of life.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I'll be doing much of my shopping online this year.
And, yes, one day when I'm old, I'll be slumped in front of my son's
computer, grousing about my own Christmases Past.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, back when I logged onto Amazon, I tell you, click-throughs
took you right to the Christmas specials. And those pop-up ads let a
man shop in peace! I remember back when e-tailing meant something!"</TE>

<HD>End AIDS-Funding Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush has not minced words about the global toll of AIDS and
last June said its devastation "staggers the imagination and shocks
the conscience." But urgent words do not amount to U.S. funding and
action, the absence of which has repeatedly been criticized by
international health officials. Dr. Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard
professor who is U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's AIDS advisor,
recently said the Bush administration had no coherent AIDS strategy.</LD>
<LD>   In a conference call with journalists Wednesday, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State Jack Chow countered such charges by saying the
administration planned to ask Congress for a $5-billion annual
increase in development aid "to those countries that demonstrate
progress [in] ... government efficiency, increase investment in
public goods such as clinics, hospitals or roads and provide economic
opportunities for people at the grass-roots level."</LD>
<LD>   That sounds promising, but the administration has yet to detail
how it will navigate the often bitter politics of international AIDS
funding.</LD>
<TE>   Here are three principles that can help the administration
formulate a cohesive AIDS strategy before President Bush sets out
Jan. 13 on a trip to sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the
epidemic:</TE>
<TE>   * Don't abandon people who live in countries that have
less-than-model governments. If mishandled, the development account
could end up as little more than a cynical end run around the Global
Fund, the international private-public partnership that works with
nongovernmental groups like Doctors Without Borders to help fight
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the regions that need help the
most, whether or not their governments epitomize modern democratic
ideals.</TE>
<TE>   * Significantly increase funding targeted at global AIDS. The U.S.
government provides about $800 million a year to fight global AIDS,
the smallest contribution of any wealthy nation as measured by
percentage of gross domestic product. The U.N. estimates that African
nations need $10 billion a year to stem HIV/AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   * Press drug companies to agree that poor nations may make and
import low-cost generic versions of expensive patented drugs for
AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and epidemics of similar gravity. Also,
reject pressure from anti-trade activists, who at a summit last week
in Geneva called on U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick to give
up legitimate intellectual property rights by allowing virtually any
country to declare any ailment a "public health problem."</TE>
<TE>   There won't be any chance of winning the war on AIDS until State
Department officials in Washington avoid distributing funding only to
those nations they like and until anti-trade activists, most of them
in Europe, work with the pharmaceutical industry rather than simply
demonizing it.</TE>
<TE>   As a United Nations study so clearly shows, AIDS -- a scourge that
infected 5 million people this year and kills 6,500 people each day
-- is too grave a threat to world stability to be used as a political
tool by anyone.</TE>

<HD>Kissinger Wrong for the Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few people know the corridors of power like Henry A. Kissinger.
National security advisor and secretary of State to presidents Nixon
and Ford a quarter-century ago, he secretly flew to China to start
the process of normalizing relations, he helped orchestrate the
secret bombings of Cambodia, he conducted closed-door negotiations
with the North Vietnamese. He is a skilled diplomat. But he is not
the best choice to head the new commission to investigate the Sept.
11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush opposed the commission and agreed to its formation
only after gaining the power to pick the chairman. The Republican and
Democratic sides in Congress each will appoint five members to the
panel. The Democrats chose as vice chairman former Sen. George J.
Mitchell, a capable mediator who helped forge a peace agreement in
Northern Ireland and, like Kissinger, shuttled around the Middle East
in an effort to bring peace.</LD>
<LD>   But a commission investigating the worst terror attack on U.S.
soil needs as its leader a tough prosecutor in the style of U.S.
attorneys crusading against organized crime and jailing drug lords.
The soft arts of diplomacy may have their place, but so do the tough
tactics of law enforcement. This panel needs to work in the open, not
in secret.</LD>
<TE>   In announcing his choice of Kissinger on Wednesday, Bush said the
investigation should "follow all the facts wherever they lead."
Kissinger promised to "go where the facts lead us" and to ignore
foreign policy considerations. That's good rhetoric; commission
members must live up to it. Asked about Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of
the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers and once home to Osama bin Laden, Kissinger
said that nation was a good ally when he was secretary of State, "but
that was 30 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Although he left office with President Ford in January 1977,
Kissinger has remained tightly connected to Washington power circles.
His company, Kissinger Associates, is known for introducing U.S.
firms looking for business overseas to leaders of foreign
governments. The company does not disclose all of its clients or
detail the work it does. There is the possibility of a conflict of
interest in investigating foreign governments that can be beneficial
to clients.</TE>
<TE>   House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating the
Sept. 11 attacks but an independent inquiry also is needed; one of
its topics should be how well those committees exercised their
oversight function before the attacks. The Bush administration had
fought the appearance of government officials before the new panel
but Congress rightly overrode the objections.</TE>
<TE>   In determining what went wrong, the new commission needs to be
truly independent, not a collection of Washington insiders protecting
old friends. The stakes are too high to allow anyone to paper over
blunders.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan: Rein In Terrorists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The civilian government that took office in Pakistan last weekend is
supposed to replace the military rule that began with President
Pervez Musharraf's coup three years ago. But looking over the
shoulder of the new prime minister, Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, will
be Musharraf, who rewrote the constitution this year so he can
dismiss the national assembly, should it displease him. Musharraf
also made it difficult for secular opposition parties to field
candidates in October elections, at least temporarily diluting
opposition to him but also clearing the way for the religious parties
to increase their political power.</LD>
<LD>   True democracy is far in the distance. But more worrisome right
now is a revolving door for jailed terrorists. The nation that made
it possible for the Taliban to take power in next-door Afghanistan
and is still home to Muslim terrorists, including some from Al Qaeda,
should not be giving away get-out-of-jail-free cards.</LD>
<LD>   Times staff writer Paul Watson has reported that security forces
detained more than 3,000 Pakistanis in sweeps of local extremist
groups but that at least 1,300 have been released, often after merely
signing promises of good behavior. Among those freed were leaders of
groups that Musharraf has banned -- one accused of killing minority
Shiite Muslims and another believed responsible for launching
terrorist attacks against neighboring India.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf deserves credit for quickly cutting Pakistan's ties to
the Taliban after Sept. 11. But he has not done enough to stop
guerrillas from crossing into Indian-controlled Kashmir, India's only
majority-Muslim state and a bitterly contested region between the two
nuclear powers.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani supporters of the Taliban and Al Qaeda are angry at
Musharraf for casting his lot with the United States. Terrorists have
staged several assaults on foreigners in Pakistan this year,
including a grenade attack on a Christian church in March that killed
a U.S. embassy employee and her daughter, a May suicide bombing in
Karachi that killed 11 French engineers and the kidnapping-murder of
Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, also in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf and the new prime minister have to act forcefully
against those inciting and carrying out violence. Trying to maintain
good relations with Washington while letting guerrillas kill Indians
and terrorists attack foreigners in Pakistan is not going to work.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Soldier Wounded as Gunmen Ambush Convoy in Afghanistan</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Gunmen ambushed a U.S. Special Forces convoy in eastern Afghanistan
and wounded a soldier in the leg, a U.S. Army spokesman said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The soldier was riding in one of four pickup trucks Wednesday
afternoon near the town of Gardez when as many as six gunmen in
civilian clothes shot at the troops with Kalashnikov rifles, Col.
Roger King said.</LD>
<LD>   Special Forces soldiers fired back as the convoy drove away. More
soldiers later scoured hills around the site but did not find the
gunmen.</LD>
<TE>   The soldier, who was hit in the upper left thigh, underwent
surgery at a U.S. base nearby. Late Thursday, he was flown to U.S.
military headquarters at the Bagram air base, north of Kabul, the
capital. He was in stable condition, King said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was initially blamed on a single sniper, but King later
said more people were involved. They appeared to be Afghans, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, King said a major cache of weapons seized north of
the central Afghan town of Bamian this week was linked to renegade
warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops destroyed or carried away about 15 tons -- three
truckloads -- of weaponry and ammunition, which included
107-millimeter rockets, rocket-propelled grenades and two Soviet-made
antiaircraft guns, King said.</TE>

<HD>Australia, Canada Embassies in Manila Closed After Threats</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Australia and Canada closed their embassies here Thursday after
receiving what they called credible terrorist threats, prompting
Philippine authorities to tighten security in the capital.</LD>
<LD>   Police closed streets, set up barricades and circled the
Australian Embassy after it was shut when Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer said Canberra had received a "very specific" intelligence
report Wednesday night warning of threats by Islamic militants. There
was no sign of increased police presence outside the Canadian
mission.</LD>
<LD>   The Philippines has been contending for years with Muslim
guerrillas in the south, and there have been sporadic bombing attacks
there and in Manila.</LD>
<TE>   Top Philippine officials met Thursday night with the Australian
and Canadian ambassadors and said they would like to see the
embassies reopened quickly. The session was also attended by a
representative of the European Union, which shut its office in the
same building as the Australian Embassy, and several other diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   "This closure, unless soon rectified, will be causing a black eye
to the Philippines in the international community and will affect the
worldwide attitude to the Philippines as a tourist and investment
destination," Philippine Foreign Secretary Blas Ople told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's embassy will be closed at least through Monday, a
spokesman said. Canada's was closed indefinitely.</TE>

<HD>In the Caucasus, a Foreign Element Threatens</HD>
<DH>Arabs lived quietly in a Georgian village, then left,
perhaps to fight in Chechnya. Suspected militants from abroad have
been arrested.</DH>

<DL>TSINUBANI, Georgia</DL>
<LD>TSINUBANI, Georgia -- In a small Georgian village where strangers are
rarely seen, the foreigners bought a house and kept to themselves.
Sometimes they borrowed a hammer or an ax from a neighbor, speaking
broken Russian and using sign language to convey their need.</LD>
<LD>   There were five Arabs in the house, according to locals in this
village in the Pankisi Gorge about 30 miles from the Russian border.
They had a black prayer banner pinned to an inside wall and a
satellite dish, both left behind when they melted into the forests in
August, along with the dozens of Chechen fighters who had made the
village their base.</LD>
<LD>   They also left a slogan, painted in Russian and Arabic on a shed
near their house: "Paradise in the shade of sabers."</LD>
<TE>   "They lived with us and then one night they just left," said
Grigory Tsarigov, a 79-year-old villager. "We don't know where they
went. They didn't understand our language and we didn't understand
theirs. Whatever they wanted they asked with their hands."</TE>
<TE>   Locals say the Arabs were in this remote village to fight on the
side of separatist guerrillas against Moscow's forces in the
neighboring Russian republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the village of Tsinubani, three to four months ago
it was mainly occupied by Chechen fighters and Arab terrorists," said
Paata Batiashvili, head of the Kakhetia district division of
Georgia's Ministry of State Security. He is responsible for
operations in the Pankisi Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   Tsinubani's Arabs disappeared. But about 15 non-Chechen
foreigners, including Arab militants, have been arrested by Georgian
authorities in the gorge in recent months. Some of the detainees have
been linked to Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Georgian officials say the foreign fighters were handed over to
U.S. authorities. A Pentagon spokesman said last week that no
guerrillas had been turned over to the American military. "We don't
have them. They were not turned over to us," Maj. Tim Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgian operation marked a step forward for this small Black
Sea nation, whose security forces in the past were fragmented,
corrupt and incompetent.</TE>
<TE>   But State Security Minister Valerian Khaburdzania recently said
that about 100 Arabs and 700 Chechen fighters had been in the gorge
early this year before the operation began to sweep the area clean --
meaning many more have disappeared, probably fleeing to neighboring
Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "We had contacts with the leaders of the armed groups,"
Khaburdzania said. "We offered their people a choice of laying down
their arms and becoming ordinary refugees like everyone else or
leaving our territory. Otherwise we'd have to use force against
them."</TE>
<TE>   The Chechen fighters and many Arabs left quietly in small groups
without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   Further steps are planned to remove the 40 to 60 fighters believed
to be still in the Pankisi Gorge, which borders Chechnya. About 20
are Arabs, according to Georgian officials.</TE>
<TE>   The gorge has been a lawless region where money and arms have been
funneled to Chechen guerrillas, particularly to Khattab, a rebel
commander linked to Al Qaeda who was killed by Russian forces in
March. But even as of this spring, U.S. and Georgian officials
believed that only a handful of Arabs with potential terrorist
connections were in the area.</TE>
<TE>   In Tsinubani, some of the Chechen fighters lived in empty houses,
while others stayed with locals who are Kists -- ethnic Chechens born
in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The Chechens and Arabs fled into the hills in the month before
Georgian forces blockaded the village Sept. 18, running a
house-to-house sweep for rebels. Seventeen Chechens were arrested,
but all were found to be refugees from the war between Russian troops
and rebels in their homeland. They were released.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials have demanded the extradition of eight Chechens
arrested crossing from Chechnya into the Pankisi Gorge over the
summer. Georgia has referred the case to the European Court of Human
Rights. Five other Chechens were turned over.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Chechen rebels seized about 700 hostages in a Moscow
theater last month, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin had
threatened military strikes to wipe out rebels taking shelter in
Georgia. After the takeover ended Oct. 26 with security forces
storming the theater, leaving 129 captives and about 50 rebels dead,
Russia increased its pressure on Georgia over the Chechens' presence
in the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   The theater siege severely damaged the Chechen cause
internationally, with the U.S. embracing Russia's line that rebel
leader and former Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov should be
excluded from any peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Pankisi Gorge, the view among Chechens and Kists of the
hostage-taking is very different.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a cry of despair," said Musa Magomedov, 31, from the
Chechen city of Urus-Martan, a former fighter who carries a refugee
ID card. "I know a girl from a village called Gekhi. Six of her
brothers were killed. Her mother and father were killed in this war.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago the Russians took her away and they cut her body with
knives and put out cigarettes on her skin. Who can guarantee that she
would not pull off that sort of act [like the hostage-taking] in the
future?"</TE>
<TE>   Magomedov said he has given up fighting, though he still has a
good pair of military boots by his door. He left Chechnya in 1999
"because I did not want to be slaughtered like a lamb." But he's sure
his year-old son will one day be a rebel fighter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll teach him that he should take up arms and fight," Magomedov
said. "I'm just a patriot. My heart aches for the Chechen land. Maybe
my son will be the next shahid [martyr] in our family."</TE>
<TE>   Russia's military campaign in Chechnya has been condemned by human
rights organizations, which in particular criticize the zachistki --
mopping-up operations -- in villages where Russians sweep in, seize
dozens of men and boys, many of them civilians, and loot and pillage.
Many of the detainees are never seen again.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Sept. 11 attacks, U.S. disquiet about links between
the Chechen rebels and Al Qaeda led the Bush administration to mute
its criticism of Russia's military campaign.</TE>
<TE>   American fears were confirmed when Georgian intelligence said that
about 100 Arabs were in the gorge at one point. The reported arrest
of Saif al Islam el Masry, a member of the Al Qaeda military
committee, in the area this summer was further confirmation of the
terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   Batiashvili, the Ministry of State Security official from
Kakhetia, which includes the gorge, said the Arabs in the Pankisi
opened a powerful communications center in the village of Lower
Khalatsani. In recent months, security forces have confiscated
CD-ROMs with terrorist training manuals; satellite phones, dishes and
phone interception devices; radios and two carloads of military
uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   "We closed down two Arab schools in August. Every single fighter
had a sophisticated radio. In the State Security Ministry, we don't
have the kind of equipment they had," Batiashvili said. "There were
many terrorist training manuals on how to take hostages, how to make
explosive devices, defensive and offensive operations, how to shoot
down planes."</TE>
<TE>   Batiashvili said messages uncovered by security forces also
suggested that the Arabs were planning terrorist attacks against
Russian or Western targets in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Kakha Kobakhidze, chief of Georgia's Internal Security Department,
said forces found videocassette recordings of rebel attacks in
Chechnya -- including killings of civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw one cassette with a Russian woman crossing the road with
her child. They fired a grenade at them and the woman was left alive,
but her child was blown up. She was left holding just her child's
arm," Kobakhidze said.</TE>
<TE>   Nika Laliashvili, spokesman for the Ministry of State Security,
said that among the Arabs were religious emissaries, financial
couriers and fighters with links to terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "They spent two years sitting there," he said. "It was
comfortable. They were recruiting people to fight in Chechnya through
the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   After Russia's sharp threats of military intervention, Putin and
Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze met early last month and
reached a deal on greater cooperation between both nations' border
guards and intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   That deal eased Russia's pressure on Georgia -- until the Moscow
hostage crisis created new tremors in the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   The departure of most of the fighters, without major bloodshed or
loss of civilian life, is something Georgian officials are quietly
gloating about. But they face another threat in coming weeks. With
Russia launching operations in Chechnya in retaliation for the Moscow
hostage crisis, there is a threat that the Chechen and Arab fighters
who deserted the Pankisi Gorge might be forced to return.</TE>
<TE>   The mountain passes will soon close for the winter. If the
fighters stay in Chechnya, they face the threat of annihilation. If
they return to Georgia, Russia will demand their extradition,
creating a new political headache for Georgia.</TE>

<HD>To Israelis, Nowhere Is Safe After Attacks in 'Nice, Quiet
Place'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson and Davan Maharaj</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- Under fire at home, uncomfortable in Europe, Israelis
seek escape from their disastrous domestic circumstance by traveling
to exotic locations. The white beaches and dramatic safaris of Kenya
have proved especially attractive, a getaway from news, violence and
pressure in a small country surrounded by hostile neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   The escape was shattered Thursday, and Israelis today feel doubly
vulnerable. Their worst fear, that Israelis are subject to attack
everywhere -- that, in fact, nowhere is safe -- has in their minds
been confirmed.</LD>
<LD>   Several hundred Israelis were targeted Thursday, including scores
of guests waiting in the lobby or walking to their rooms at the
Paradise hotel on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, and 271 passengers and
crew members aboard an Israeli charter jet that narrowly missed being
hit by two surface-to-air missiles as it departed the nearby Mombasa
airport.</LD>
<TE>   The synchronized attacks killed at least 15 people, injured dozens
and painted for Israelis a world a little bit smaller and a lot more
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "Israelis have always kept an eye open in the back of their
heads," said Stuart Schoffman, an Israeli writer and commentator who
travels extensively in Europe and the United States. "Now I would
think people are going to keep that eye more open and more alert than
before. You would think that a place like [Mombasa] is exotic and
obscure, but in today's world, there's nothing that's obscure."</TE>
<TE>   The events in Kenya also had an effect on Israeli politics,
frightening people on the very day that about 300,000 were eligible
to vote in a primary for the right-wing Likud Party that will
essentially determine the next prime minister of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who conceded the race to
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in Thursday's vote, called a morning news
conference within hours of the attacks to say they validated his
opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday, I warned that our planes would be attacked with
missiles should the Palestinians be granted a state," he said. "Today
we suffer missiles in Mombasa; tomorrow it will be Ben Gurion,"
Israel's main airport.</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much that he or other officials could say that
comforted potential voyagers. Travel agents often caution Israeli
tourists to refrain from speaking Hebrew loudly, or suggest that
religious men wear baseball caps instead of yarmulkes.</TE>
<TE>   But as Netanyahu put it, "We can't put an armed guard by every
Israeli tourist."</TE>
<TE>   Israelis are inveterate travelers. Young adults frequently go
backpacking in Nepal or India for months on end, usually in the year
before or after mandatory army service. Families often spend Passover
or summer holidays abroad.</TE>
<TE>   After the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, began 26 months ago,
Israelis drastically curtailed visits to neighboring Egypt and
Jordan. In recent months, many Israelis said they felt uncomfortable
in Europe: They regarded anti-Israel sentiment generated by the
Palestinian conflict as a festering form of anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   And so, far-flung destinations have become more and more popular,
and travel agents say Kenya held special allure, offering warm seas
and wild animals for relatively inexpensive prices.</TE>
<TE>   At the Paradise hotel, thousands of Israelis arrived every year
for $750-a-week package deals. About 100,000 Israelis have flocked to
Kenya's beaches in the last six years, according to the Paradise
Mombasa Co. travel agency, which specializes in such tours.</TE>
<TE>   Like clockwork, a weekly charter flight deposits about 300
Israelis every Thursday morning and retrieves about the same number
for transport home. From the Mombasa airport they are driven over
unpaved roads lined with robust baobabs and swaying coconut palms to
the secluded, gated Paradise hotel. Signs at the hotel are in Hebrew
and English. On this Thursday, a large menorah was on display.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli families who flew to Kenya on Thursday would have been
spending the Hanukkah holiday there. Instead, some were in hospitals
and others were awaiting evacuation.</TE>
<TE>   "Now everyone is thinking of going home," said David Kapah, a
banker from Tel Aviv who escaped his flaming room with his
12-year-old son. "Our friends who came here before told us it was
such a nice, quiet place with a nice beach and friendly people. Look
what happened."</TE>
<TE>   "New York is not safe, Karachi is not safe, Tel Aviv is not safe,
and now this tiny village is not safe from terrorism," said Israeli
businessman Sulami Yehuda, who operates the hotel. "We don't need any
more proof that nowhere is safe from terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Surely the luckiest people of the day were the passengers aboard
Arkia Flight 582. Minutes after it took off from the Mombasa airport,
as Capt. Rafi Marek pulled up the landing gear, two missiles whizzed
by the left side of the aircraft. Marek felt a bump and thought it
was probably a bird -- except for the two streaks of white smoke that
trailed through the morning sky.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the passengers did not realize how close to death they had
come, until they saw Israeli F-16 fighter jets outside their windows
once the flight entered Israeli airspace.</TE>
<TE>   When the Boeing 757 touched down, the pilot had these simple
words: "We are home."</TE>
<TE>   The passengers applauded and burst into song. "Hevenu shalom
alechem." "We have brought peace unto you."</TE>

<HD>Venezuela Referendum on Chavez OKd, Then Overturned by
Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Venezuela's electoral council agreed Thursday to hold a nonbinding
referendum on whether President Hugo Chavez should resign, but the
Supreme Court later ruled against the panel's decision.</LD>
<LD>   The National Electoral Council called the Feb. 2 referendum in a
3-1 vote with one member abstaining, citing a new law allowing
approval by a simple majority.</LD>
<LD>   But in its ruling late Thursday, the court said the panel was
still bound by an old electoral law requiring approval by four of the
five council members.</LD>
<TE>   "The referendum still hasn't been called," said electoral council
member Romulo Lares, the abstaining member. "That decision is null,
according to the Supreme Court's ruling."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment by the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's allies challenged the referendum as soon as it was
announced, saying the electoral council had overstepped the law.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in the southwestern state of Apure late Thursday, Chavez
reiterated his view that under the constitution, the earliest a
referendum can be held is August -- halfway through his current
six-year term.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not afraid of the referendum," he said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 Chavez supporters protested outside the electoral
council Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 4, thousands of government opponents delivered a petition
with 2 million signatures demanding the referendum, which would ask
whether Chavez should voluntarily resign. Electoral officials said
they had verified about 1.2 million signatures -- the threshold
needed.</TE>
<TE>   The lone dissenter on the council, Romulo Rangel, said a more
thorough check of the signatures was needed.</TE>

Although I have no idea what organization funded this project, if it

out several years ago, by virtue of then-Sen. William Proxmire's

<LD>Recently, while driving my daughter to Harding Street School, I had
the pleasant experience of viewing a refrigerator that had been
dumped behind El Cariso golf course. Among the greenery of the park
this disgusting piece of trash lay wide open for all to see. How
thoughtful of the people who pitched it off some truck in the middle
of the night. Last week it was a mattress and box springs that ended
up along the stretch of road near the airstrip on Gavina Avenue. I
think it's still there.</LD>
<LD>   My sincere thanks to Joe Cuevas, head greenskeeper at El Cariso
golf course, for promising to help get rid of the refrigerator. It's
not his responsibility, but being a decent human being, he will deal
with it because some jerk wouldn't. Our family moved here six months
ago from Michigan, and the worst part of the culture shock is the
fact that I regularly see people in the area around Sylmar behaving
like pigs. In line at a fast-food restaurant recently, a man got his
food, opened it and threw the wrappers out the window. I lived in
Michigan all my life and never witnessed such blatant disregard for
other people and the environment. Shame on all of you who think other
people are supposed to clean up after you!</LD>

<LD>Re "Homeland Agency Is Big at Birth," Nov. 26: It is incongruous that
President Bush, while signing the homeland security bill, is at the
same time gutting the Civil Service protections of those federal
employees whose agencies will be incorporated into the new Department
of Homeland Security. This action will unquestionably have a negative
effect on the morale of these employees. As the federal government
organizes its fight against terrorism, it's hard to imagine how
undermining the job security of the 170,000 civil servants of the new
department will improve the government's ability to deliver on the
promise of protecting us from terrorist attacks.</LD>

<LD>I was rather amused at the letter that stated that lawyers should be
banned from serving in Congress (Nov. 25). Perhaps the person writing
thinks that amateurs would be better at writing laws than someone who
has studied law. Maybe we should also prohibit those with medical
degrees from practicing medicine. By the way, I'm not a lawyer.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "How the Politicos Stole Christmas," Commentary, Nov. 26: To the
victor (Republican majority) go the spoils (corporate welfare). It is
amazing that a bright man such as Robert Scheer actually hopes --
after belittling and tormenting President Bush in particular and
Republicans in general -- that the Republican majority will turn
around and reward the unemployed, who generally have not voted
Republican.</LD>
<LD>   Further, it is outrageous for Scheer, who consistently demonizes
the right-wing religious right, to bring the name of Christ into his
arguments about the Republicans not helping the poor. The Bush
administration has been consistent in its belief that helping the
poor is most efficiently done through churches, charities and
faith-based initiatives. Even if the Republicans wanted to extend the
unemployment benefits, it would be irresponsible, given federal and
state deficits.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, some of the recent legislation passed is payback for support
in the recent campaign season, but what about the payback the unions
and trial lawyers received from the Democrats under former President
Clinton? By the way, I'm still waiting for my middle-class tax cut
promised by Clinton.</LD>
<TE>   The answer, and the Republicans have it correct, is that more tax
cuts will stimulate investment, which in turn will stimulate jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, unemployment benefits are at best a short-term solution
and at worst a return to a welfare state.</TE>
<TE>   Michael C. Rost</TE>
<TE>   Altadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The breathtaking arrogance of the Republican congressional
leadership in gifting the pharmaceutical companies and legitimizing
offshore tax havens under the cover of homeland security is beyond
contempt. Apparently one of the primary beneficiaries of the
pharmaceutical provision is Eli Lilly and Co., whose chairman, just
incidentally, has a seat on the president's Homeland Security
Advisory Council. And Bush's budget director, Mitch Daniels, is a
former Eli Lilly executive. I guess this holiday season will be a ho
ho ho for corporate America and for the rest of us a hunk of coal in
a sock. Unfortunately, it will probably be dirtier coal.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The prominent Nov. 25 obituary on U.S. Army nurse Lynda Van Devanter
is not only a tribute to a brave lady but also a reminder of the
terrible mental and spiritual wounds suffered by the war combatants
that prevent them from ever living a normal life again. She was
especially honored by the Vietnam Veterans of America for telling
that story. Now, America is rushing into another ruinous foreign war
with no mention of the inevitable human consequences to ourselves and
those we have demonized as the "enemy."</LD>
<LD>   We can honor Van Devanter's memory by doing all we can to stop
America's warlords from sending young men and women to Iraq to be
similarly destroyed in mind, if not body, to establish empire and
U.S. world domination. That is how President Bush can truly support
our troops and promote the security of our country and our neighbors
as well. It's the patriotic thing to do.</LD>

truth about what is happening to military retiree health care
(Commentary, Nov. 25).</LD>
<LD>   While military retirees are being kicked out of the Pentagon's
Army, Navy and Air Force hospitals, the president's pets in the White
House are eligible for health care from the Army. And let us not
forget about the Congress and congressional staff members who receive
health care on Capitol Hill from the Navy.</LD>
<LD>   Turley's commentary should be a major topic on every major news

<HD>Iraq's Weapons: You Can't Prove a Negative</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Iraq Bears Burden of Proof," Nov. 26: Anyone with common sense
or, at any rate, any insomniac who (like me) has read himself to
sleep over the years with Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe detective novels can
tell you that it is logically impossible to prove a negative. What
could Iraq conceivably be expected to show to Hans Blix's inspectors
to "prove" the absence of what it claims it does not have?</LD>
<LD>   That the media report such rubbish without a trace of irony shows
how shallow and uncritical they have become. The thinking public
should demand at the very least that President Bush, before he takes
the fateful step of an unprovoked attack against Iraq, prove to us,
the American soldiers and taxpayers, that Iraq is indeed hiding
weapons that are a threat to the U.S. If Bush cannot find positive
proof of his accusation, any U.S. attack on Iraq would be illegal,
and Bush has no right to commit our country to a course of
international banditry, especially because it would alienate many of
the very nations we need at our side in the coming years in our fight
against terror.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While it is laudable that Blix wants to prove that Saddam Hussein
has no weapons of mass destruction, and that The Times so informs its
readers, it might be instructive to revisit freshman logic or even
high school geometry: One cannot "prove" a negative.</TE>

<TE>   After reading "The Military's New War of Words" (Opinion, Nov.
24), I felt vindicated that there is confirmation that our government
is trying to brainwash us that we have nothing to fear but Hussein.
The mantra of "weapons of mass destruction" has succeeded in scaring
the average person to a state of paranoia. It is disturbing that our
leaders have manipulated the media to focus on Iraq instead of the
sorry state of our economy and the crisis of the global economy. What
happened with the investigations of corporate fraud and the
prosecuting of Enron executives?</TE>
<TE>   We punish a guy for stealing a bike and let all these corporate
crooks fleece their companies and cheat hard-working people. And to
think that there are intelligent people who believe we should change
the regime in Iraq so that we can export our corporate democracy.
Every time I get a statement from my stock portfolio I cry. Then I
get angry and, recalling a phrase from the movie "Network," I yell: I
am mad as hell and cannot take it anymore!</TE>

<LD>Re "EPA Eases Pollution Guidelines," Nov. 23: So the Bush
administration, in its infinite wisdom, is allowing industrial
polluters to escape requirements for state-of-the-art pollution
controls because it feels that if industry is allowed more
flexibility it will "voluntarily" reduce pollution. I say we test
this theory by forcing industry executives (and the EPA's chief,
Christie Whitman) to move their families downwind of the polluting
plants. This will encourage them to "put their money where their
lungs are."</LD>

<HD>Chess Club Is King at Day School</HD>
<DH>With a little help, a group of Valley Village youngsters
unplug from modern toys to take up the challenge of the ancient board
game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a world where games often ping and whistle, you can almost hear
the sound of thinking as the young students at Beth Hillel Day School
lean over their chessboards.</LD>
<LD>   Chess club, which meets three days a week at the private
elementary school in Valley Village, counts 15 of its 50 students as
members.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have a baseball team, we don't have a football team, but
for a little day school like this to have a chess club gives the kids
a sense of school spirit and identity," said Susan Isaacson, school
director.</LD>
<TE>   Attorney Lisa Miller, the mother of 8-year-old Max, a third-grader
and club member, organized the club this fall to keep the boys and
girls interested and to teach them how to play first-rate chess. Her
motive is one that resonates with parents everywhere. "Better to
light a single candle," she said, "than to curse the darkly seductive
electronic games."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 36, put the club together the way she might prepare a
legal brief -- with a clear sense of the desired outcome and
meticulous attention to detail. She found Timothy Taylor, of Beverly
Hills, an international chess master (one of a handful in Los
Angeles) to tutor the team. "They call him the Pete Sampras of
chess," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also enlisted the help of four chess-loving teenagers from
nearby North Hollywood High School's highly gifted magnet program.
They serve as senior directors of the club's chess lab, where they
teach the 1,500-year-old game to youngsters half their age. Miller
gave them each the title "senior lab director" because she knew it
would look good on their college applications.</TE>
<TE>   That the club members are Jewish, while their mentors include a
Muslim and Christians, may be noteworthy in a different context. But
everyone involved with the team is a citizen of chess, where one's
status is based on the ability to think ahead and the sole creed is
that it is good and just to besiege the other player's king.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, 49, explained that in chess, nothing catastrophic happens
to the king: "When the rules were codified in the 15th century, they
believed in the divine right of kings and you couldn't kill the
king."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent chess lab, 15-year-old Mohammad Guiamelon, one of
the senior lab directors, patiently talked 6-year-old David Gottlieb
through a game. When Mohammad first arrived as a mentor, some of the
children mispronounced his name "Bahama." They eventually got it
right, just as they are now mastering such chess essentials as how to
castle and how to do chess notation, the standardized method for
recording the moves in a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to lose your knight?" Mohammad asked David, when the
first-grader inadvertently put his knight at risk. "What are the ways
you can guard your knight?" the teenager prompted.</TE>
<TE>   David likes checkers as well as chess. "Y-E-S," he answered, when
asked if chess is harder. But he prefers it, because its
sophisticated moves and strategies make the simple jumping of
checkers seem, well, simple.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammad, who aspires to an Ivy League school or top-notch
California college, used to have chess skirmishes with his brother,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a way to express yourself creatively," Mohammad said of the
game. "Each individual piece has a personality, and how you play
reflects your personality." Of his style, he said: "I'm very
aggressive. If I see an opening, I just go for the jugular."</TE>
<TE>   There are challenges to teaching the game to children, some of
whom have yet to master long division.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest thing to teach them is patience," Mohammad said.
"They just want immediate gratification."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow lab director Robert Rose, 16, who is active in his Woodland
Hills church and aspires to attend West Point, has been playing chess
for about 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Chess helps build logic skills and thinking skills, and I wanted
to help these kids out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chess master Taylor said the game does many things for youngsters
who master it: "It allows you to imagine something and then make it
real, so it expands your imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Often chess leads to other discoveries, as players begin reading
the many books on the game and looking into the lives of the great
champions, many of them Russian. "It introduces you to the whole
world," said Taylor, who has written three books on chess and two
novels.</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers are an important addition to the club, he said:
"They've shown them the fun side of the game. They're very relaxed
and easygoing, and they let them win a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson is pleased the students are interacting with such fine
role models.</TE>
<TE>   Young Max Miller is proud of his mother for bringing the club to
life. But he isn't sure chess is the intellectual five-in-one tool
his elders believe it to be. Asked if chess helps him concentrate,
Max thought for a moment and said: "What helps me concentrate is
PlayStation 2."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Miller writes and distributes a weekly chess club newsletter
whose tone is shamelessly rah-rah, she concedes. It includes the name
of the chess student of the week, a title with a prize attached as
well as glory.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly, this gets sent to a lot of grandparents," Miller said of
the newsletter. And she made a Hanukkah prediction: "There are going
to be a lot of chess sets under a lot of menorahs this year."</TE>

<HD>Fatal Crash Kills Two; Driver Held</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hit-and-run driver killed two people and injured another Thursday
night when his speeding pickup truck slammed into two cars on a
residential street in Canoga Park, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The driver of the pickup tried to run, witnesses said, but was
chased by neighbors who pinned him to the ground until police
arrived. He was taken into custody and was being treated at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center for undetermined injuries, said
Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Jason Lee.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred about 7 p.m. at the corner of Vanowen Street
and Kelvin Avenue in a block of modest apartment buildings.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of a bronze-colored sedan, a woman who appeared to be
in her 30s, died at the scene. Her car was crushed like an accordion,
its front end pushed up against a curb.</TE>
<TE>   One passenger, a 15-year-old girl, was taken by air ambulance to
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Another, older female was taken to
Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills where she died,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said it was unclear if the second car hit was occupied.</TE>
<TE>   After the crash, about 100 people, their holiday evening
interrupted, spilled onto the sidewalk. "People on the street chased
down the guy trying to run," said Fernando Martinez, 17, who said he
saw the accident occur from across the street. "They held him down
till the cops came. The truck was driving real fast."</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Man Convicted in Slaying of Football Player</HD>
<DH>Robert Hosea claimed self-defense in the stabbing over a
woman whom both were dating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott and Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After deliberating a little more than a day, a Ventura County jury
has convicted an Oxnard man of first-degree murder for fatally
stabbing a semiprofessional football player during a fight over a
woman.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Hosea, 20, faces 26 years to life in state prison when
sentenced Jan. 9.</LD>
<LD>   During his trial, Hosea admitted stabbing Artis Jackson, 25, with
a butcher knife during a brawl over a woman whom both men were
dating.</LD>
<TE>   But Hosea told jurors he acted in self-defense after the heavy-set
football player threatened him and began to slam his head into the
pavement outside an Oxnard apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors concluded, however, that Hosea had deliberately attacked
Jackson with the intent to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole self-defense argument was out the door fairly
quickly," said one juror, who declined to give his name, after the
verdict was delivered late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors told lawyers outside the courtroom after the verdict was
returned that they thought Hosea intentionally retrieved the knife in
order to confront Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon said the March 26 killing
was particularly egregious because it occurred in front of the
victim's young son.</TE>
<TE>   "He leaned down and said goodbye to his father because he knew he
was going to die," Simon said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, Hosea had been dating Oxnard resident
Demetrice Folse for a few months when she left him and returned to a
live-in situation with Jackson, her former boyfriend and the father
of her son.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson played football for the Pasadena-based California Bandits.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the killing, Hosea drove to the couple's Vineyard
Avenue apartment and waited outside, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   About 8 p.m., as the couple and their son were walking to a nearby
store, Hosea jumped Jackson, they struggled and Jackson was stabbed
several times with a knife, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson died of wounds to his neck and back a few hours later at a
local hospital, Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   During the weeklong trial that started Nov. 18, Deputy Public
Defender Joseph Villasana argued that his client had acted in
self-defense after being attacked by Jackson and Jackson's brother,
who had seen the fight begin from the couple's apartment balcony.</TE>
<TE>   Simon argued that the killing was premeditated because Hosea had
confronted Jackson earlier the same day, then driven a few miles to
Ventura, where he retrieved the knife from his sister's house.</TE>
<TE>   Hosea remains in custody.</TE>

<HD>Marion Carpenter, 82; '40s News Photographer Died in
Obscurity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marion Carpenter, one of the first women to be a White House
photographer, who traveled with President Harry Truman and covered
him daily, has died. Although Carpenter broke ground in her
profession, she died alone and destitute at the age of 82.</LD>
<LD>   Her body was found Oct. 29, it was reported this week, on a couch
at her St. Paul, Minn., home, bundled up tightly against the cold
because the thermostat had been lowered to save money.</LD>
<LD>   The body is still at the county medical examiner's office while
friends -- most of whom Carpenter met at garage sales or thrift shops
-- try to track down her only child, a son whom she had not seen in
more than 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   "She sounds like the type of woman upon whose shoulders we all
stand," said Susy Shultz, president of the Journalism and Women
Symposium. "It's sad that we don't know about a Marion Carpenter. The
women who came along in the '30s, '40s and '50s had it the hardest.
They were the women breaking paths."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, Carpenter was one of the first women in the White
House News Photographers' Assn. She was the only woman among a
handful of photographers who traveled with Truman.</TE>
<TE>   Her unique status made critics of some of her male colleagues,
such as Washington Times-Herald columnist Tris Coffin, who complained
in print that she used her feminine charms -- "smiled and teased" --
to persuade politicians to pose for her.</TE>
<TE>   When Carpenter saw Coffin in the Senate restaurant, she sloshed a
bowl of navy bean soup over his face, then stalked out. A photograph
of the incident was published with the headline "Carpenter Nails
Coffin."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to smile or tease anyone to get them to pose," she
later told a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter studied photography in St. Paul and went to Washington
when she was about 24. She won the White House job as a photographer
for the International News Photos syndicate.</TE>
<TE>   In her belongings when she died were photos she took of Truman,
which the president inscribed to "Miss Carpenter."</TE>
<TE>   One of the photos, which shows Truman striding uphill toward the
Washington Monument, bears the message: "It's good exercise if you
keep it up, but not for high-heeled shoes, Miss Carpenter."</TE>
<TE>   How her life unraveled is a book with many missing pages.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a story and a half," said a friend, Beverly Allstopp.
"But we've all just got pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Marion was a very
private person, and she kept a lot of things from everybody."</TE>
<TE>   According to what she told her friends late in life, a love affair
with a married man may have helped end her career prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter's marriage to a Navy officer who abused her ended in
divorce. In Washington, she fell in love with a Capitol journalist.
When the affair ended, Carpenter remarried. Her new husband, a radio
announcer, took her to Denver, where they had a son. By 1951, the
marriage -- and her career -- were over. She was 31.</TE>
<TE>   Back in St. Paul, Carpenter ran a wedding photo business and
worked as a nurse to support her mother and child.</TE>
<TE>   In her later years, Carpenter passed time at thrift shops, sitting
on used furniture while browsing through old copies of National
Geographic.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter showed magazines to friends and explained why
photographs were composed the way they were.</TE>
<TE>   "She was sensitive, and kind, with an overflowing heart," Allstopp
said. "But that heart covered up a lot of bitterness.... She had a
heartache, and I think it caused her to be a recluse."</TE>

<HD>Beating the Odds in Garden Grove Race</HD>
<DH>Lan Nguyen is among new generation of politically active
Vietnamese Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lan Nguyen knows all about long odds.</LD>
<LD>   His family, all 10 of them, escaped Communist Vietnam to settle in
Orange County. He arrived in 1980 with his mother and six brothers,
after a perilous boat trip to Malaysia and a year in a refugee camp.</LD>
<LD>   His oldest brother and father, who were held captive in a
Communist reeducation camp, escaped years later and joined them.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Nguyen, 38, beat the odds again, pulling an
eleventh-hour upset against a two-term incumbent in a Garden Grove
school board race. He became one of the first two Vietnamese
Americans to win such elections in the country. The other is Madison
Nguyen, 27, no relation, who won a seat on the Franklin-McKinley
elementary district board in Santa Clara County, which also has a
sizable Vietnamese community.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was going to be difficult," said Lan Nguyen, who won by
76 votes after trailing in preliminary counts to trustee Terry
Cantrell. "But I couldn't wait, the community couldn't wait."</TE>
<TE>   The urgency to bring a Vietnamese American voice to the school
board was apparent in the numbers, Nguyen said. Orange County's
Vietnamese American community -- more than 134,000 -- is the largest
in the country and concentrated in Garden Grove and Westminster. The
Garden Grove Unified School District, which serves both cities, has
the largest Vietnamese American student population in the nation --
about 11,000 children or 28% of the district. Both cities have
Vietnamese American officials on their city councils but, Nguyen
said, the absence on the school board was glaring.</TE>
<TE>   "Education requires everyone to get involved," he said. "The
teachers, the students, the parents."</TE>
<TE>   Cultural and language barriers have prevented Vietnamese parents
from participating in the district, said Nguyen, who's married to
computer programmer Helen Tran, 36. The couple have a 2-year-old son,
Andrew.</TE>
<TE>   "It was never about academic performance; we have very good
schools," he said. "But [Vietnamese] parents feel very intimidated
because they don't know whom they can go to. Now they can come to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen is among a young crop of Vietnamese Americans who have come
of political age.</TE>
<TE>   In the Nov. 5 election, Westminster elected its second Vietnamese
American council member, Andy Quach, 30. Tony Lam, who become the
first Vietnamese American elected official in the country in 1992, is
retiring from the Westminster City Council at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove's mayor pro tempore, Van Thai Tran, 37, a friend of
Nguyen's, was elected in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Community observers say these candidates represent a political
maturation in the Vietnamese American community. The first
generation's primary concern was making a living in their new
country. Their U.S.-educated children are beginning to assert
themselves politically.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that there is a trend," said Tran, who
campaigned for Lan Nguyen and Madison Nguyen. "The number of new
voters in the community has increased dramatically in the last four
years."</TE>
<TE>   That increase is credited in large part to the candidates
themselves. In many ways, they built a constituency. Lan Nguyen's
campaign, for example, helped register 6,800 new voters in the
county, he said. His volunteers helped 9,500 voters in the district
with absentee ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen, an attorney and longtime community activist, also was
aided by his family story, which is well-known among local Vietnamese
Americans and evokes memories of their own difficult journeys to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the first members of Nguyen's family escaped
Vietnam, his father and oldest brother were freed from the
reeducation camp where they had spent seven years, he said. But it
would be another 10 years before the family was made whole.</TE>
<TE>   His brother escaped by boat to Japan and reunited with the family
in 1982. His father stayed behind in the event his eldest failed and
ended up in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Nguyen's father bribed his way out of the country to
Germany, where he sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. In
1992, the family was finally reunited.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the rough beginnings, all eight sons went to college,
Nguyen said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   And when it comes to beating the odds?</TE>
<TE>   "I've always rooted for the underdog," he said.</TE>

<HD>Spitzer's Early Out Can Speak for Itself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I figured Todd Spitzer would want to purge himself, to confess his
sin. He is, after all, the young pol who burst onto the Orange County
scene six years ago demanding accountability in government.</LD>
<LD>   He found in me a willing admirer -- and not just because Spitzer
made Mickey Conroy mad enough to give him the finger during their
1996 contest for the 3rd District supervisor's seat. No, what I liked
was Spitzer's brashness and his embrace of an age-old journalistic
tenet: Never be afraid to ask what might be a stupid question. Given
that he was joining a sedate board that slept through the county's
buildup to bankruptcy in 1994, Spitzer was a human alarm clock.</LD>
<LD>   Just 36, Spitzer began his first term in January 1997 and didn't
disappoint. What other supervisors were ready to rubber-stamp, he'd
delay a vote on. Where others saw sacred cows, he saw targets.</LD>
<TE>   Cocky and self-congratulatory, critics said. True, but ... those
are only major drawbacks if you're stupid, too. Spitzer wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen months into his first term, he aired his frustrations
while flashing his characteristic Toddness: "I knew there would be an
opportunity at some point in life," he told me, "where there would be
a void and gap in leadership and somebody, like me, with my
fortitude, would need to step forward and be held accountable."</TE>
<TE>   That's all I wanted -- an explanation for his recent sudden
resignation from the Board of Supervisors, a move that apparently was
timed to keep Tom Coad from running for his seat.</TE>
<TE>   Coad is the husband of outgoing Supervisor Cynthia Coad. The Coads
pushed for an airport at El Toro and, as a result, often quarreled
with Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   It's also known that the county Republican establishment favors
Bill Campbell to succeed Spitzer. The theory is that Spitzer helped
out the establishment by resigning earlier than expected to keep Coad
-- who hasn't yet moved into the 3rd District -- from establishing
residency in time to run.</TE>
<TE>   That's how it played out. Spitzer is out, and so is Tom Coad.</TE>
<TE>   The county will survive without a Coad on the board, and the loss
is even more palatable when considering Coad's plan to run in a
district where he has never lived. But that's the kind of thing that
should be taken into account by voters, not outgoing supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows if Spitzer dreamed up the early resignation on his own.
County GOP executive director Kathy Tavoularis says she knew nothing
about it until she read about it in the paper. "We couldn't get
involved in a nonpartisan race," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Oh.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I needed Spitzer, the man who always calls back, the
man who's accountable. Except that after about a week, reporters who
cover the supervisors gave up trying to reach him. His only public
comment on the day he quit was that preparing for the Assembly was
eating up his time and that it would be selfish to continue on the
board.</TE>
<TE>   Ah.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to hear Spitzer disavow with a straight face any
tricksterism. Spitzer aide Jeff Solsby took my call Wednesday and
said he'd leave my message with Spitzer. A couple hours later, amid
the sounds of silence on my phone, I asked Solsby for Spitzer's cell
phone number, and Solsby said, "I have the number and I left the
message."</TE>
<TE>   I don't need a building to fall on me.</TE>
<TE>   I'm still glad Todd Spitzer breezed through county government.</TE>
<TE>   He left Tom Coad holding the bag. Conduct unbecoming, but you have
to admit it was a pretty good stunt.</TE>
<TE>   My suggestion for Coad: Go have a couple drinks with Mickey
Conroy.</TE>

<LD>Ray Avery, 82, a jazz photographer, collector and retailer whose work
brought him into close contact with such artists as Billie Holiday
and Louis Armstrong, died of a heart attack Nov. 17 at UCLA Medical
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Avery began collecting jazz recordings as a student at Big Bear
Lake High School. He opened his first jazz record store, the Record
Roundup, on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles in 1936. He relocated
a few times, eventually opening Rare Records and New in Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   His stock included rare or obscure selections by Benny Goodman,
Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Holiday, Bing Crosby and the Original
Dixieland Jazz Band, one of the first bands to make jazz recordings,
about 1920. He closed the store in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   His photographs documented the birth of West Coast jazz in the
1950s and the artists who defined the period. His early work appeared
on album covers for musicians such as Shelly Manne and Clifford
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Many of his best-known shots were taken when he was hired as the
photographer for "The Stars of Jazz," a half-hour television show
hosted by the pianist and singer Bobby Troup that aired from 1955 to
1958. His work from the program was showcased in a 1997 book called
"Stars of Jazz."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Angus Cameron, 93, who was the editor in chief of the Little, Brown
publishing company until his leftist views forced his resignation
during the communist-hunting 1950s, died Nov. 18 in Charlottesville,
Va. The cause of death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Cameron, who joined the publishing house in 1938, was known for
his astute understanding of public taste and writers' creativity. His
authors, who included J.D. Salinger and Lillian Hellman, won
Bancroft, Francis Parkman and Pulitzer prizes.</LD>
<LD>   He resigned his post in 1951, when Little, Brown asked him to
cease his involvement in leftist organizations.</LD>
<TE>   For a brief time he rejected urban life and lived with his family
in the Adirondacks. His wilderness adventures included catching
whitefish and selling them to Eskimos with the help of an Alaskan
bush pilot.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952 he started a publishing house with a partner, Albert E.
Kahn. They published "False Witness" by Harvey Matusow, a paid
informer who confessed to having falsely accused 200 people of having
communist ties.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959 he was hired by Alfred A. Knopf as an editor. During his
years there he collaborated with editor Judith Jones on "The L.L.
Bean Game and Fish Cookbook," published in 1983.</TE>

<HD>Helen Levi Travis, 86; Activist Convicted for 1963 Trip to
Cuba</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen Levi Travis, 86, a social activist whose conviction for
violating a U.S. ban on travel to Cuba was thrown out in a 1967
Supreme Court ruling, died Nov. 14 in San Pedro. The cause was not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Travis became involved in socialism as a Barnard College student
in the 1930s, when she joined students in a trip to Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   With her first husband, Abbott Simon, who was a leader of the
radical American Youth Congress, she helped establish a clandestine
safe house outside Prague to shelter anti-Fascist activists. She
later returned to the U.S., became an auto worker, and was divorced
from Simon.</LD>
<TE>   Her second husband, Robert C. Travis, was a principal organizer of
the violent 44-day strike in Flint, Mich., in 1936-37 that forced
General Motors to recognize the United Auto Workers.</TE>
<TE>   Her own brush with the government came in 1963, when she was
charged with making two trips to Cuba without a valid passport.
Travis was secretary of a committee providing medical aid in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   She was found guilty and given two suspended sentences and a
$10,000 fine. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
upheld her conviction, but her attorneys argued that the law only
withdrew U.S. protection for citizens who traveled to restricted
areas and did not authorize punishments for such trips.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court agreed and tossed out her conviction in its 1967
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Travis, who later worked as a social worker, also was head of the
Fellowship for Social Justice of the First Unitarian Church of Los
Angeles and a longtime supporter of El Rescate, which provides legal
aid and social services to Central American refugees.</TE>

<HD>Rehab Center Looks for New Home</HD>
<DH>Oxnard vows to help the Rainbow facility relocate after
approving a park plan to turn the site into a farm museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 17 years, staffers at the Rainbow Recovery Center have gone about
the painful task of repairing the lives of women ravaged by drugs,
alcohol and mental illness. By all accounts, it has been a quiet,
successful operation, located at Oxnard's College Park.</LD>
<LD>   But in the fast-growing city, the "Rainbow Ladies," as employees
and patients of the center are often called, are in the wrong place
at the wrong time.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, a divided City Council adopted a $20-million renovation
for the 75-acre park that does not include the recovery center.</LD>
<TE>   The two houses they rent will be used for a farm heritage museum.
The women have to be out by January 2004, enough time, they say, to
find another home.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a sad night, but we've regrouped and we're not going to
let this get us down," Executive Director Kathleen McQuillan said.
"We've got each other. We're just trusting in God, trying to be
grateful for the things that we do have."</TE>
<TE>   The city's plan calls for development of two dog parks, baseball
and soccer fields, a lighted basketball area, a fenced skate park and
a 26,000-square-foot community center with a gym.</TE>
<TE>   The Rainbow house would be converted into a farm museum dedicated
to the county's agricultural history.</TE>
<TE>   The women had vowed to fight to the bitter end, but conceded
defeat after last week's council vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to apply for grants and write proposals until
our hands fall off," McQuillan said.</TE>
<TE>   The center, which relies on a variety of grants and private
donations, has no reserves to pay the $2 million it would likely cost
to buy a new building that could accommodate up to 22 women,
McQuillan said.</TE>
<TE>   The city has pledged to help find a new place, and officials have
said they will not formally agree to any museum plans until the
center finds a new home.</TE>
<TE>   But Mayor Manuel Lopez, who voted against the master plan for the
park, has warned that finding a welcoming place will be difficult and
costly.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll probably have to wind up building something for them, and
it's going to be very expensive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, city officials began trying to find a new
location, but they have already run into opposition from residents
who lived near a proposed site in Oxnard's historic district.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where you see the contradictions," Rainbow counselor Jerry
Smith said. "They want to see alcoholics and drug addicts off the
streets, but they don't want the place that treats them and keeps
them off the street in their neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   McQuillan said she hopes the city keeps its promise, but isn't
counting on it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to let them off the hook," she said. "But we're
not putting all our eggs in one basket."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, the Rainbow Ladies had a tough fight on their
hands. For starters, they have no legal claim to the two old
farmhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Also, when the county transferred ownership of the park to the
city in 2000, the deed stated that the property could only be used
for "parks and recreation purposes," officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They do great work, but when the recovery center was allowed to
come to College Park, they had no intention of staying 17 years,"
City Atty. Gary Gillig said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rainbow people, maybe not the ones that are there today, knew
that the plan was for the park to be developed. They had a
month-to-month lease."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the city and county changed the terms of their agreement
to allow inclusion of the center, state grants to finance the
estimated $20-million cost of renovating the park might be more
difficult to obtain if there is a drug recovery center on park
grounds, Gillig said.</TE>
<TE>   "The state provides money to the city, but it's always with
strings attached," he said. "It's very difficult for me to believe
that an alcohol-and-drug recovery center is appropriate use of a
public park."</TE>
<TE>   But Nancy Williams, an assistant at the center, beams with pride
at the houses she and the other women have rebuilt. "We do a service
for this community," Williams said. "We're saving lives here; we're
reuniting families."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard officials do not deny this. They have praised the Rainbow
Ladies for their hard work and say they recognize the city needs
their services. But, the officials add, not at a park.</TE>
<TE>   McQuillan and other counselors have tried not to mention the
controversy to the women they help. But recovering addicts such as
Robin Olson, 35, know their place of refuge might soon be in someone
else's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "They break you up and build you up and get you rooted for real
life here," she said. "There's been a lot of tears shed here
throughout the years, and it's just wrong to have to go."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking through her own tears, McQuillan tries to stay
optimistic. "Moving day will be sad, but we'll go on. And wherever we
go, we'll make that our home, and we'll help women, and we'll
continue to do our work," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is," she said, "that anything can happen in a year,
honey."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Sharing Scud Missile Research Data With Israel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Scud missiles have been launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base
this month as part of a three-year program to improve missile defense
systems -- a milestone in a study that has the U.S. sharing
information with Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the launches, witnessed by a team of Israeli and
U.S. military and defense industry officials, mark the first
instances in which the weapons have been fired from U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   The Scud research has been conducted with a high level of secrecy.
For example, officials Wednesday would say only that the two missiles
were obtained from "foreign sources."</LD>
<TE>   The Soviet Union developed the Scud in the 1960s, and the missile,
used by Iraq against Saudi Arabia and Israel during the Persian Gulf
War, is now in the arsenal of at least 25 nations.</TE>
<TE>   "Both missiles were similar to advanced Scuds now in the Iraqi
arsenal," said Chris Taylor, spokesman for the U.S. Missile Defense
Agency. "It was a very good series of tests."</TE>
<TE>   According to Defense Department officials, the study is partly
aimed at helping develop a new generation of U.S.-made Patriot
ground-to-air missiles and other defense technology.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq fired about 90 Scuds. One killed 28
U.S. soldiers at a barracks in Saudi Arabia. Most of the 39 fired at
Israel landed in unoccupied areas, but two people were killed and
about 200 injured.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. enters another war against Iraq, officials fear that
Scuds could again be aimed at Israel, which is defended by the
Israeli-made Arrow antimissile system as well as Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   The Scud missiles, each one 36 feet long and 13,000 pounds, have
been notoriously unpredictable in flight. They tend to wobble wildly,
sometimes making them difficult to shoot down.</TE>
<TE>   One goal of the two tests, involving missiles fired in daylight
Nov. 14 and in darkness Monday morning from a mobile launch pad, was
to study the trajectory of the weapon and its characteristics during
flight.</TE>
<TE>   Before the launches, sensors that measure speed, altitude, engine
burn rate and other flight traits were installed. The missiles
carried mock warheads and were launched over the Pacific Ocean,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The first Scud traveled about 115 miles and reached an altitude of
150,000 feet before splashdown, officials said. The second traveled
186 miles and reached an altitude of 281,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The project at Vandenberg, near the Santa Barbara County city of
Lompoc, began in 2000 and will end next November, Taylor said. A
preliminary report will be completed in the spring.</TE>

<HD>In Ventura, the Case of the Novelist's Missing Museum</HD>
<DH>Erle Stanley Gardner's fans say the 'Perry Mason' writer
deserves hometown recognition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small brass plaque hanging on the side of an old bank building in
downtown Ventura is the only memorial to the site where
attorney-turned-author Erle Stanley Gardner dictated his first Perry
Mason novels in the early 1930s.</LD>
<LD>   It is a mystery to devoted Gardner fans that the city hasn't done
more.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, some Ventura residents say it is downright criminal that
no statue or municipal museum has been erected to celebrate their
most famous and prolific author, whose savvy protagonist introduced
the masses to courtroom drama long before O.J. Simpson or Court TV.</LD>
<TE>   Gardner's mystery novels have sold about 300 million copies
worldwide. They led to the creation of the "Perry Mason" television
series, which made its debut in 1957 and ran until 1966. Reruns
continue to draw viewers into the tales of the brilliant defense
attorney, his beautiful assistant, Della Street, and his
prosecutorial adversary, Hamilton Burger. (Another version of the
show ran in 1973-74.)</TE>
<TE>   "Erle Stanley Gardner is perhaps our most famous son," said
Ventura historian Richard Senate, who wrote a book on the late
author's connection to the town and periodically leads tours of
Gardner's old haunts.</TE>
<TE>   Though few today are aware of the connection, Gardner's work is
infused with characters and street names drawn from his early years
of practicing law in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   A Massachusetts native, he arrived in Oxnard in 1911, when the
farm town had a sugar beet factory, a few thousand residents and a
reputation for brothels and gambling dens.</TE>
<TE>   Although he had no law degree, Gardner passed the bar and made a
name for himself representing Chinese Americans and other minority
clients.</TE>
<TE>   One of his better-known cases involved two dozen Chinese American
merchants accused of gambling with undercover detectives. Guessing
that the officers would not be able to distinguish his clients,
Gardner had them switch places at their businesses. After they were
arrested under the wrong warrants, the case was thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a liberal with a capital L," Senate said. "He hated the
death penalty and spoke up for liberal causes. He defended minority
groups, and he was a spokesman for the underdog."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney H. Frank Orr invited Gardner to join his prestigious firm
in downtown Ventura in 1915, and the lawyer soon began writing pulp
fiction at night in the study over his garage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, Gardner sent a letter to the William Morrow &amp; Co.
publishing house, proposing a series of mystery novels with a
crime-solving lawyer as the title character. Perry Mason was born.</TE>
<TE>   "The stories were that he was a pretty darn good attorney, but he
was a better writer," said John C. Orr, a Ventura probate and estate
planning attorney whose grandfather hired Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   An avid hunter and fisherman, Gardner also was an incredibly
prolific writer.</TE>
<TE>   From his third-floor office in the bank building at California and
Main streets, Gardner dictated the first of 82 Perry Mason novels,
starting with "The Case of the Velvet Claws" in 1933.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, he scaled back his law practice and kept a team of
secretaries busy typing manuscripts. In all, Gardner wrote 155 books
and more than 400 articles before his death in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Guinness World Records ranked Gardner among the
best-selling authors in the world. And though Gardner's name is not
as well known today, a Ballantine Books spokeswoman said the
publisher has sold more than 3.5 million of his books in paperback
since 1985 alone.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, Ventura has done little to celebrate him.</TE>
<TE>   There is no memorial at the Ventura Hall of Justice. Several
judges said they are unaware that one had ever been suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Avid Gardner fans say the city, which is trying to market its
historic downtown as a tourist destination, is missing an
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "That we don't have a physical museum is Ventura's loss," said
Keith Burns, a documentary film writer and book collector who has
tried for years to rally support for such a project.</TE>
<TE>   Burns and his friend John Anthony Miller, an online book dealer
who started a virtual museum dedicated to Gardner on the Internet,
have collected just about every one of the novels written by the late
author.</TE>
<TE>   They also have acquired Gardner's typewriter, law books and
financial records, a giant customized wooden desk and even the
author's baby cup. Their collection includes suits, ties and scripts
used by actor Raymond Burr when filming the "Perry Mason" television
series.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to share the collection with the rest of the city, Burns and
Miller opened a small museum at a temporary location in downtown
Ventura three years ago. But with rentals skyrocketing in the
downtown redevelopment area, they could not afford to keep the
display open.</TE>
<TE>   "This city," Miller writes on his Web site, "should consider this
a matter of utmost importance to the cultural and economic progress
of this coastal area ... but it does not."</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Burns have since acquired an old 35-foot-long county
bookmobile, which they fill with memorabilia and park on Main Street
during art walks and other special events.</TE>
<TE>   "We're exasperated," Burns said. "We have plans. Our stumbling
block is, we can't advance the funds for a [permanent] museum."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walker, Ventura's community services director, acknowledges
that the city doesn't offer much in terms of Perry Mason history,
other than the plaque, paid for privately, and walking tours.</TE>
<TE>   "That is about it," Walker said. "There have been different
discussions about what would be an appropriate recognition, but there
hasn't been any discussion about developing a physical facility for
that purpose."</TE>
<TE>   With tight budgets, he said, it is doubtful the city could open
its purse strings for such a project.</TE>
<TE>   Senate, the historian, said an idea was floated a few years ago to
name a tiny park next to a downtown parking garage after the
attorney. But city leaders rejected the proposal, saying the future
of the land was still undetermined.</TE>
<TE>   Burns suggested naming the alley near Gardner's old office Della
Street. That was deemed too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The old marble courthouse where Gardner tried cases and on which
he reportedly modeled the courtroom set for the "Perry Mason" series
is now City Hall. Burns would like to see city officials free up
space for a temporary museum. But Walker said that is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Gardner plaque remains. And Perry Mason aficionados
continue to look for a location to house a museum.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are literary-minded," Burns said, "are trying to help
a literary man find his place in the sun."</TE>

<HD>Goodwill Harvest for Tree-Sitter</HD>
<DH>Protester's friends and supporters hold a Thanksgiving
feast at the ancient Santa Clarita Valley oak targeted for
relocation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gust of wind rained dust onto a potluck lunch table, and John
Quigley suddenly had himself a rustic Thanksgiving meal.</LD>
<LD>   No bother. The Pacific Palisades resident traded in the comforts
of home 28 days ago to perch in a giant 400-year-old oak near Santa
Clarita in an effort to prevent it from being toppled by developers.
If the luxury of a hot shower is a distant memory, a little sand in
the mashed potatoes wasn't much to whine about.</LD>
<LD>   The 42-year-old tree-sitter at the fenced-off site in Stevenson
Ranch has drawn crowds daily, and Thursday was no different, with
cars coming and going all day. Dozens of families en route to
Thanksgiving celebrations used the day to see Quigley and the tree,
which is 261 years older than the national holiday declared by
President Lincoln.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not an environmentalist by any means. But at some point,
someone has to say enough is enough," said Brett Camacho, who came
from Fresno to have Thanksgiving dinner with his mother in Valencia
and took the opportunity to urge Quigley on.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Colton, a Valencia resident who has been at the tree every
day since Quigley climbed it, didn't break that streak on
Thanksgiving. "I've written him notes, I've sent him money, I've done
whatever helps," she said. "I never felt like I belonged to a
community until I got involved in this."</TE>
<TE>   Developer John Laing Homes wants to widen the adjacent Pico Canyon
Road from two lanes to four to meet the needs of the growing suburb.
The company announced last week that it would uproot the tree at a
cost of $250,000 and replant it in a nearby park. But Quigley said
the tree is too old to survive the shock of a move, and he refuses to
step down.</TE>
<TE>   With minivans and cars lined along Pico Canyon Road, the area
around the tree took on a festive atmosphere. A man walked around
playing a banjo. Cameras flashed. Children rode their bikes and
hurled questions at Quigley, asking him how he went to the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   A small table held sliced turkey, a fruit basket, cranberry sauce,
mashed sweet potatoes, pies and other traditional treats.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley climbed down to the lowest point of the tree possible
without touching the ground to grab a plate of turkey and sweet
potatoes. Pecan pie, his favorite, was nowhere to be found.</TE>
<TE>   The activist and his supporters have already pledged to resist any
attempts by authorities to move the tree, Quigley said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday may have been the calm before the storm as friends and
supporters held a feast in front of the oak, nicknamed Old Glory.</TE>
<TE>   "I never imagined I would get this much attention," said Quigley,
who was surrounded by his supporters, holding hands and praying.
"Today's a day to give thanks for everything the earth has given us."</TE>
<TE>   At one point a heckler drove by, shouting, "You're a joke. Get out
of the oak!"</TE>
<TE>   Quigley's response? "Happy Thanksgiving."</TE>

<HD>Baby Given Up Under State Safe Haven Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A healthy newborn was dropped off at a fire station in Wilmington on
Wednesday under the state's Safe Haven law, which allows parents to
surrender babies with no questions asked.The 7-pound boy, believed to
be about an hour old, was brought to Fire Station 38 about 8:30 a.m.
by a woman who said she was the mother's cousin, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters checked to make sure he appeared healthy and took him
to a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "We are pleased that in a time of duress, a troubled parent would
see the warmth and safety of a fire station as preferable to a
doorstep or worse," said department spokesman Brian Humphrey.</LD>
<TE>   In effect since 2001, California's Safe Haven law allows for the
anonymous surrender of babies at hospitals within 72 hours of birth
without criminal prosecution. It also provides for a 14-day period in
which the mother may change her mind and reclaim her baby.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County expanded the law to include county Fire
Department stations as drop-off sites. Several of the county's 88
cities have included their municipal fire stations. The city of Los
Angeles has yet to formally include its stations, but city
firefighters were informed of the law.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 babies have been turned in statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously this mother has done the right thing," said John
Musella, a spokesman for county Supervisor Don Knabe.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles man was killed early Thursday when his car veered off
Pacific Coast Highway and tumbled down a rocky embankment at the
ocean's edge.</LD>
<LD>   Nilay Shrenikbha Shah was pronounced dead at the scene of the 2
a.m. accident near Sycamore Canyon, about two miles south of Point
Mugu State Park, according to the Ventura County medical examiner's
office.</LD>
<LD>   California Highway Patrol Officer Mike Moriarty said Shah had just
dropped off a group of friends at Mugu Rock and was southbound on
Pacific Coast Highway.</LD>
<TE>   The car, a silver Mercedes-Benz, went off the road as it rounded a
curve at high speed, Moriarty said. The car tumbled 260 feet, landing
on a rocky shelf just above the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the car were strewn along the rocks, evidence of the
tremendous impact of the crash. The engine wound up in the water
below.</TE>
<TE>   "The car just kind of blew apart," Moriarty said.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd gathered along the busy highway Thursday to watch tow
truck drivers pluck the wreckage from the embankment.</TE>
<TE>   That work briefly tied up traffic in both directions.</TE>
<TE>   Moriarty said Shah, believed to be a Los Angeles-area college
student, was wearing his seat belt at the time of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   He said there was no evidence that alcohol played any part in the
crash.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two accidents Thursday night killed three people and injured three
others.</LD>
<LD>   In Canoga Park, two people died when a speeding pickup truck
slammed into two cars at the corner of Vanowen Street and Kelvin
Avenue, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The driver of the pickup tried to run, witnesses said, but was
chased by neighbors who pinned him to the ground until police
arrived. He was taken into custody and was being treated at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center for undetermined injuries, said
Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Jason Lee.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of a bronze-colored sedan, a woman who appeared to be
in her 30s, died at the scene. Her car was crushed like an accordion,
its front end pushed up against a curb. Another, older female was
taken to Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills, where she
died, authorities said. The second passenger, a girl, 15, was taken
by air ambulance to Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, where she was in
critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Police said it was unclear if the second car hit was occupied.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2800 block of Laurel Canyon Boulevard near Mulholland
Drive, a sport utility vehicle carrying six people overturned. One
passenger, a 15-year-old male, was pronounced dead at St. Joseph's
Hospital in Burbank, where he was pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   Two other passengers suffered minor injuries and were taken to
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, police said.</TE>

<HD>Zsa Zsa Gabor Hurt in Crash</HD>
<DH>The 85-year-old actress is in serious condition after the
car she was riding in jumps a curb and smashes into a light pole in
West Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was in serious condition Thursday, the day
after a convertible in which she was riding slammed into a light pole
in West Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The car, driven by an unidentified man, jumped the curb at Sunset
Boulevard and Sweetzer Avenue and hit the pole about 4:30 p.m.
Wednesday, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Bruce Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   Gabor, 85, riding in the passenger seat and not wearing a seat
belt, "was thrown about the vehicle and sustained some serious
injuries," Thomas said.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, who was wearing a seat belt, suffered minor injuries
and was treated at the scene, Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Gabor was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where a
spokeswoman said she remained in serious condition Thursday. A
spokesman for her husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, said in a
statement that she suffered broken bones and cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Hungary, Gabor has been married eight times. Among her
husbands were actor George Sanders and hotel magnate Conrad Hilton.
Gabor has also been linked to men ranging from John F. Kennedy to
billionaire J. Paul Getty, has penned several autobiographies and has
cultivated an image as one of America's last glamour queens.</TE>
<TE>   She has appeared in more than 75 movies; many, such as "Touch of
Evil," "The Story of Three Loves," "The Girl in the Kremlin" and John
Huston's "Moulin Rouge," date from the mid-20th century.</TE>
<TE>   She was in the limelight again in 1989 when she slapped a Beverly
Hills police officer who had pulled her over in her custom-made
Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible for having expired license tags.</TE>
<TE>   She was fined and sentenced to three days in jail. She also was
ordered to visit a psychiatrist and to perform 120 hours of community
service at a women's shelter.</TE>

<HD>N.J. Postal Facility Shuttered by Anthrax May Open by
Summer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAMILTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A New Jersey mail facility closed for more than a year because of
anthrax contamination could be cleaned up in the spring and reopened
by summer, a U.S. Postal Service official says.</LD>
<LD>   The tentative timetable is the first given by postal officials for
cleanup of the Hamilton building, which was contaminated last October
when anthrax leaked from letters that were being processed there.</LD>
<LD>   The cleanup in Hamilton will begin after anthrax is cleared from a
contaminated facility in Washington, said Thomas Day, a vice
president of engineering for the postal service.</LD>
<TE>   During the decontamination, the buildings will be sealed and then
fumigated with chlorine dioxide to kill any spores that remain
inside, Day said in testimony before a state Assembly committee.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of cleaning the two buildings is expected to be more than
$100 million.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 employees were relocated when the Hamilton office
closed. Local officials have been frustrated by the delay in cleaning
up and reopening the building.</TE>
<TE>   Five people died and 13 others were sickened last fall when
anthrax-laden letters were mailed to NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw, the
New York Post and the Washington offices of Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). All bore
Trenton postmarks.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has yet to name a suspect, though officials say there are
about 30 "persons of interest."</TE>

<LD>The military command responsible for the defense of North American
airspace scrambled fighter jets in response to unverified reports of
an airborne condensation trail, or contrail, moving from the
Caribbean to the U.S., Defense officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The jets found nothing, an official said. The incident Wednesday
is being investigated.</LD>
<LD>   The reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility
that it could have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet
aircraft in or approaching American airspace.</LD>

<LD>President Bush jogged, fished, ate and drove around his ranch near
Crawford, spending an active holiday with more than a dozen relatives
and pets in tow.</LD>
<LD>   The Bushes' feast resembled the traditional fare many Americans
enjoyed -- but with a few twists. The bird was brined, or soaked in
salt, sugar and water, to make it tender, ahead of roasting, and the
green beans were being served with anchovies and red peppers.</LD>

<HD>Harvard Law Dean Plans to Relinquish His Post</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Harvard Law School Dean Robert C. Clark, who presided over a major
reorganization of the student body, has decided he will step down at
the end of the academic year.</LD>
<LD>   Clark, a corporate law scholar and dean since 1989, said this week
that he planned to return to the school's faculty after a sabbatical.</LD>
<LD>   Clark, 58, oversaw an overhaul at the school, reshaping the
student body into seven groups of roughly 80 students each. He also
led a $183-million fund-raising campaign, completed in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   "The law school has flourished under Bob Clark's outstanding
leadership," Harvard President Lawrence Summers said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Summers said he will soon appoint a faculty group to advise him on
a successor.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said he decided to step down at the end of the academic year
because it will also mark the end of the preliminary phase of a major
fund-raising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a sense that I should choose a natural break point,"
Clark said. "I've loved being dean ... and I like being a professor.
I'm a lucky guy."</TE>

<HD>WPA's Folk Art Is Back in Public Eye</HD>
<DH>National Gallery of Art exhibit 'Drawing on America's Past'
will show a small part of the collection assembled in the Great
Depression.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration
launched a project to illustrate American folk art, it ended up with
18,527 watercolors of quilts, weather vanes, old tavern signs and
merry-go-round animals -- a vast art gallery in itself.</LD>
<LD>   Now 80 of the artworks and 37 of the original objects are on
display as the National Gallery of Art celebrates the 60th
anniversary of its acquisition of that collection. The show, which
opened Wednesday, is called "Drawing on America's Past." The artwork
will be on view through March 2.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors will learn about life-size sculptures that adorned shops
in the 1800s. There were not only cigar-store Indians, but
cigar-store Turks, a figure advertising lunch who may have been Mike
"King" Kelly, a baseball star of the 1880s, and a comic carving of
Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, known from a Civil War song for
feeding his horse corn and beans.</LD>
<TE>   The gallery stores these thousands of paintings -- known as the
"Index of American Design" -- in 829 boxes made of acid-free
materials. It keeps them at ground level so they can be moved quickly
in case of a flood. Light, temperature and humidity are carefully
controlled.</TE>
<TE>   While the paintings are well protected, the same cannot be said of
the original folk art objects.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was looking for original pieces to put with the paintings,
I could only find a third to a half of them," said Virginia Tuttle
Clayton, the show's curator.</TE>
<TE>   What became of the rest isn't known, though some simply were
destroyed by neglect.</TE>
<TE>   "People left cigar-store Indians out in the rain, and I saw one
carousel horse that children had played on so much that it was
painted black and eventually collapsed," Clayton said.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings were part of Roosevelt's efforts to pull the nation
out of the Great Depression through public works projects. About
1,000 artists in 34 states and the District of Columbia took part.
Top pay in New York was $23.50 a week, equivalent to about $250
today. That was barely enough to keep a small family alive, but more
satisfying to an artist than selling apples on a street corner.</TE>
<TE>   The project ended in 1942. World War II was raging and the job
shortage was over. The final cost, Clayton estimates, was less than
$100 per watercolor. The gallery won in a squabble between poet
Archibald MacLeish, who was librarian of Congress, and Harry Hopkins,
the WPA chief, over where the collection would be housed. The WPA art
director, Holger Cahill, favored the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   The main purpose of the index, Clayton said, was to provide
American artists with a "usable past" that could inspire distinctive
work in the way that history, mythology and Bible stories had
inspired great European art. It didn't work out as expected, she
writes in the exhibit catalog.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half of the 20th century, the most famous American
artists cultivated abstract art, which did not represent American
history, folk art or anything else that most ordinary people could
recognize -- just the artist's thought and feeling. Painters such as
Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning dealt in lines,
colors and shapes.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Rosenberg, a critic who promoted the abstract painters,
said their work and folk art were both expressions of "coonskinism,"
a word coined to recall the raccoon skin caps favored by Daniel Boone
and other American pioneers. Europeans and Europeanized Americans of
the 1800s preferred hats made of beaver skin.</TE>

<HD>Loggers Told to Avoid Some Trees</HD>
<DH>Workers are warned about radioactivity from nuclear
experiments carried out in New Mexico in the 1940s and '50s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LOS ALAMOS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Workers thinning forests near Los Alamos National Laboratory have
been told not to remove trees cut down in certain areas because they
might be radioactive.</LD>
<LD>   "The lab has identified a few patches in a zone not heavily
forested that was surveyed before and after experiments in the 1940s
and 1950s," said Jim Danneskiold, a spokesman for the lab where the
first atomic bomb was built in 1945. "As a precaution, we've told
them [workers] to steer clear of those areas."</LD>
<LD>   The trees are in Bayo Canyon, about 40 miles northwest of Santa Fe
and popular with horseback riders and hikers. The site, formerly
known as Technical Area 10, was used in the 1940s and 1950s as a
place where scientists at the nuclear lab studied explosions.</LD>
<TE>   Danneskiold said the area where radioactive contamination has been
detected is a 1-acre site where all the trees were blown away during
tests on explosives.</TE>
<TE>   That area has been fenced off to workers and the general public.
The lab is warning workers not to remove wood thinned in the 30
surrounding acres as a precaution against possible contamination.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no risk to recreational users," Danneskiold said.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Recreational users should be worried. Breathing that dust is not
good," said Greg Mello, who heads the Los Alamos Study Group, which
monitors lab activity.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of homes and thousands of acres burned in May 2000 when
fire ravaged the area near Los Alamos and threatened the laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, forest and county officials have been thinning parts
of the pine forest to reduce the risk of fire, said Bill Armstrong, a
forester with the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   Trees collected on laboratory property from areas where
experiments never occurred are being given to the public as firewood,
Danneskiold said.</TE>

<HD>After All the Bad Publicity, Publicist Ready to Leave Jail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For publicist-to-the-stars Lizzie Grubman, there was the scandal, the
media skewering, the mea culpa and the click of handcuffs. Now, in a
drill Grubman knows well, there's the comeback.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman is scheduled to get out of jail today after doing time for
backing her Mercedes SUV into a crowd outside a nightclub, then
bolting, leaving 16 injured.</LD>
<LD>   She will have served 37 days of a 60-day sentence at the Nassau
County Jail, having gotten time off for good behavior.</LD>
<TE>   The publicist's publicist, Dan Klores, knocked down rumors that
Scene 1 of Grubman's second act would be an exclusive network
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure she'll be back at work on Monday, raring to go," he
said. "Her work ethic is second to none."</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, 31, built a thriving business promoting careers and
parties for the likes of Britney Spears, rapper Jay-Z, hip-hop mogul
Sean "P. Diddy" Combs and the Backstreet Boys.</TE>
<TE>   She was jailed Oct. 23 after pleading guilty to leaving the scene
of an accident and assault charges in the incident outside a Hamptons
club in the summer of 2001. A teary Grubman apologized to the victims
of the crash -- "I'm haunted by it daily" -- before she was led away
in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   It was hardly hard time. Reports in the city's tabloids -- some
generated by Grubman in jailhouse phone interviews -- revealed that
she occupied herself reading a Danielle Steel novel, snacking on
Oreos and winning an election as representative of her tier. Life on
the inside also meant giving a flannel Victoria's Secret nightgown to
a fellow inmate who was cold, and signing autographs for other
inmates.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the inmates were rather fond of her," defense attorney
Stephen Scaring said.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman earned top-10-list status on David Letterman's "Late Show"
-- her (purely fictitious) No. 1 complaint about jail: "You can't,
like, leave" -- and advice from Long Island Lolita-turned-columnist
Amy Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, once jailed for shooting and wounding the wife of her
auto-mechanic boyfriend, warned Grubman about a common jail
affliction -- foot fungus. "It would look hideous all squished up in
a new pair of Prada shoes," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The crash heightened tensions between locals on the east end of
Long Island and the wealthy out-of-towners who flock there every
summer. Some locals viewed Grubman, the daughter of a high-powered
entertainment attorney, as just another rich, spoiled outsider.</TE>
<TE>   The Grubman tale was told in an ABC-TV documentary on the
Hamptons. The New York Post sponsored a contest that awarded an SUV
like the model Grubman drove. Top associates defected from her public
relations firm, as did A-list clients.</TE>
<TE>   Klores said Grubman's only offense was being "young and blond and
ambitious," and predicted her business would rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "The past year and a half has taught her the invaluable lesson of
humility," he said.</TE>

<HD>Federal Land Agency Plans Nevada Wild Horse Roundup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO</DL>
<LD>The Bureau of Land Management plans to round up more than 2,000 wild
horses from the northern Nevada range to reduce herd sizes, a move a
horse advocacy group calls misguided and unnecessary.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning Sunday, BLM officials will round up 2,650 wild horses to
keep the herds in check, preventing them from starving and destroying
rangeland already damaged by overgrazing and drought.</LD>
<LD>   Animals taken off the range will be screened and placed in the
BLM's wild horse adoption program.</LD>
<TE>   Trina Bellak, founder and president of the Potomac, Md.-based
American Horse Defense Fund, questioned how many horses the adoption
program can handle.</TE>
<TE>   "After these roundups, where are they going?" Bellak asked. "We
need to stop rounding up thousands and thousands of horses for which
no home exists."</TE>
<TE>   The first gather will remove about 870 horses from the Monte
Cristo Herd Management Area west of Ely, which is jointly managed by
the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM said the move is necessary to achieve the "thriving
natural ecological balance" required by the 1971 Wild Horse and Burro
Act.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,100 wild horses roam the range, according to the BLM,
which has set an appropriate level of 236 horses for the region.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said three years of drought have placed added stress on
the herd and the condition of the range, as well as wildlife and
livestock.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Kolkman, manager of the BLM's field office in Ely, said the
numbers alone prompt the need for a roundup.</TE>
<TE>   "When one adds drought conditions to the situation, it becomes
imperative that we gather wild horses to prevent them from dying of
thirst or starvation as well as destruction of the environment," he
said</TE>
<TE>   The second large-scale roundup is to begin Monday in the Owyhee
Herd Management Area 90 miles northwest of Elko near the Nevada-Idaho
line. The goal there is to remove about 985 horses, leaving about 230
on the 338,000-acre management area.</TE>
<TE>   Similar efforts involving the removal of about 800 horses from the
Jackson Mountains north of Winnemucca and Pershing County's
Stillwater region also are pending, said BLM spokeswoman Maxine Shane
in Reno.</TE>
<TE>   Around the country, the BLM cares for about 16,000 captured wild
horses -- 9,000 at long-term holding facilities and 7,000 at
temporary adoption centers, said Shane, who agreed the supply of
horses far outweighs the demand from those adopting them.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been gathering more quickly than we've been able to adopt
horses," she said. "Within three weeks we're going to gather nearly
3,000 animals. But you adopt those animals one at a time."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 40,000 wild horses that roam the open range in Western
states, about half are in Nevada, where about 6,300 horses were
rounded up last year.</TE>
<TE>   Bellak argued that instead of rounding them up, federal officials
should make the horses a priority when making decisions about how to
use public lands.</TE>
<TE>   Federal land managers give too much weight to the interests of
ranchers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is public land. It belongs to everyone," she said. "I don't
know too many people who go hiking or on vacations to view cattle."</TE>

<HD>Enzyme May Be Key to a Longer Life</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As Americans feasted on plates of Thanksgiving turkey Thursday, U.S.
scientists reported they have made progress in understanding how
eating less leads to longer life.</LD>
<LD>   Studies in rodents, yeast and other organisms have found that
drastically cutting calories extends life span, and researchers are
striving to find out how that happens. The hope is that drugs may
mimic that effect in humans, without making them eat less.</LD>
<LD>   In a report in today's edition of the journal Science, researchers
said studies with fruit flies, which have many genes similar to
mammals, showed that an enzyme called Rpd3 histone deacetylase likely
is a key to longevity.</LD>
<TE>   "If you decrease the level of enzyme without eating less, you
still get life span extension," said Stewart Frankel, a Yale
University research scientist and the study's senior author.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, flies with genetic mutations that resulted in lower
levels of the enzyme lived from 33% to 50% longer than normal. With a
low-calorie diet, life span was extended by 41%.</TE>
<TE>   The enzyme may be an attractive drug target, said Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   He said more research, which probably would take several years, is
needed before scientists find a drug that can safely provide the same
effect in people. The drug would have to be convenient and safe to
take for many years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One drug, called phenylbutyrate, is thought to target the Rpd3
enzyme, Frankel said. A study published earlier this year showed that
feeding that drug to fruit flies extended their lives.</TE>

<HD>More Logging Allowed in Black Hills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Logging in Beaver Park in South Dakota's Black Hills National Forest
can continue now that environmentalists have lost their legal battle
to block it.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham said this week that he would
not halt the work because a new logging law did not violate a 2000
settlement between the government and environmentalists that limited
logging in the forest.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) attached the
legislation to an emergency spending bill last summer to exempt parts
of the state from environmental regulations and allow more tree
cutting to try to prevent wildfires.</LD>
<TE>   Nottingham said Congress legally changed those regulations with
its South Dakota exemption. He also said the 2000 settlement,
negotiated by both sides and approved by the federal court, allows
the government to change its forest management plan.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Novak, a lawyer for the Biodiversity Conservation
Alliance, had argued that Daschle's legislation shouldn't be allowed
to trump the pact.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance, along with several environmental groups including
the Sierra Club, had negotiated a change to the settlement earlier
this year to allow limited logging to prevent wildfires. The revised
settlement was added to the spending bill and included a provision to
exempt those projects from environmental review, including public
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Club spokesman Steve Smith said that relaxing those
regulations is a bad precedent but that the legislation still limits
logging and sets aside 3,600 acres as wilderness. The group did not
take a position in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The Beaver Park project, which began last month, was temporarily
halted Nov. 14 after the first hearing on the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Nottingham wanted to give more time to environmentalists to
respond to a last-minute brief submitted by the government.</TE>
<TE>   A fire that forced the evacuation of the gambling town of Deadwood
scorched 11,589 acres in July. Then, a 13,700-acre fire that erupted
in August destroyed three homes and forced hundreds of residents to
flee their homes near Mt. Rushmore in the southern Black Hills.</TE>

<HD>2 Studies Differ on Effect of Mercury on Risk of Heart
Disease</HD>
<DH>They disagree on a connection, but other experts agree
people should still eat fish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Two studies have yielded contradictory findings about the possible
heart dangers of eating mercury-laden fish.</LD>
<LD>   Plenty of research shows that mercury accumulated from fish can
harm the developing brain of a fetus or child. Far less is known
about how the toxic, widespread pollutant affects the heart.</LD>
<LD>   Two studies in today's New England Journal of Medicine on the
long-term effects of mercury exposure on the hearts of middle-aged
and elderly men had opposite findings.</LD>
<TE>   One found no clear link between mercury levels in the body and the
risk of developing heart disease; the other found men who had
suffered a heart attack had higher mercury levels than similar men
who had not.</TE>
<TE>   That left the researchers, Food and Drug Administration officials
and other experts agreeing on just two things: More research is
needed, and people should not stop eating fish, because minerals and
fatty acids in fish protect the heart. Also, many fish, such as
salmon and shrimp, contain little or no mercury.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, yes, you should eat fish, and, yes, you
should know which fish have mercury" levels considered unsafe, said
Dr. Daniel M. Shindler, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson Medical
School in New Brunswick, N.J., who was not involved in either study.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA, Environmental Protection Agency and many state agencies
report such information. For years, they have warned women who are
pregnant, nursing or of childbearing age to avoid fish from
mercury-contaminated waterways, and large, long-lived predators such
as sharks and swordfish, which accumulate mercury from all the
smaller fish they eat.</TE>
<TE>   The American Heart Assn., citing new research showing the omega-3
fatty acids in fish reduce the risk of heart disease, last week
reiterated its guidelines that people eat at least two servings of
fish per week, preferably fatty fish.</TE>
<TE>   One of the New England Journal studies indicated that the mercury
contamination in fish offsets the benefits of a key fatty acid, DHA.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
reviewed data and tissue samples from an earlier, nine-country
European cardiac study. They compared 684 middle-aged men who had had
one heart attack with 724 similar men who had not had a heart attack.
They looked at the men's health history, use of tobacco and alcohol,
and toenail clippings and fat withdrawn from their buttocks.</TE>
<TE>   Toenails hold accumulated mercury, and fatty tissue accumulates
DHA; their levels in each subject were measured.</TE>
<TE>   Those with the highest mercury levels were nearly 2.2 times more
likely than those with the lowest levels to have had a heart attack,
said Dr. Eliseo Guallar, assistant professor of epidemiology at
Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Harvard School of Public Health studied 470 men who
had had heart surgery or a heart attack, comparing each with a
similar man without heart disease. Dr. Walter C. Willett, a professor
of epidemiology and nutrition, said mercury levels in the men's
toenails corresponded well with the levels of fish they reported
eating, but his team found no association between mercury exposure
and risk of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Willett and Guallar said there could be several explanations for
their disparate results, from differences in the fish eaten in
America and Europe to how the patient and comparison groups were
picked in each study.</TE>
<TE>   Both studies followed up on a 1995 Finnish study that found an
increased risk of heart disease in people whose hair had high mercury
levels.</TE>
<TE>   The new studies looked only at men, and Shindler said the findings
can not necessarily be applied to women.</TE>

<HD>Pilots May Not Embrace Law on Guns in Cockpit</HD>
<DH>If properly trained, they would be able to take the weapons
on board by this spring. But fewer than half are expected to do it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Commercial airline pilots could start carrying guns into the cockpits
as early as this spring as protection against terrorist attacks. But
fewer than half are expected to do so.</LD>
<LD>   The homeland security bill that President Bush signed Monday
includes a provision allowing pilots on passenger planes to carry
weapons if they're qualified and trained.</LD>
<LD>   Al Aitken, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Assn., said he expects
more than 30,000 of the 100,000 U.S. airline pilots will volunteer to
become "federal flight deck officers." Congress stipulated the
training should begin within three months.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not something that we wanted, it's not something that we're
eager to take on, but as responsible Americans, we realize it's
something that has to be done," said Aitken, whose union represents
14,500 American Airlines pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Blake Wyttenbach, a pilot for Mesa Airlines, said he'll probably
volunteer to carry a weapon, though he opposed the program at first.
"I'd feel a little safer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show most Americans want to allow pilots to carry weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Dan McFadden, 78, of Woodbridge, Va., said guns would have given
the doomed pilots of Sept. 11 a chance to save themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't need to know how to shoot a peanut off a stick,"
McFadden said this week as he waited to pick up his son at Reagan
National Airport. "A body's pretty big."</TE>
<TE>   But Jill Roach, 32, of Germantown, Md., said she'd rather see air
marshals on all flights.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the pilots could focus on flying," said the mother of two as
she waited at the airport to pick up relatives for Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   No federal air marshal has ever fired a weapon on a plane, said
Robert Johnson, of the Transportation Security Administration,
created by Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   That agency was given broad authority to set standards, develop a
training program and write rules for what kind of weapons will be
used. The new law also requires airlines to train the flight crew in
self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said pilots won't need the 10 1/2 weeks of training that
federal air marshals get. Unlike the air marshals, pilots would
probably encounter only one or two situations where they'd fire a
weapon -- chiefly a cockpit breach -- and would have a much more
limited field of fire, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be the right training for the mission they would have to
carry out given the environment they're in and the challenge they
would face," Johnson said. "They're not going to be air marshals."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson cautioned, however, that a money shortage may limit the
number of pilots who can be trained. Congress didn't authorize any
funding.</TE>
<TE>   Aitken is a member of the Joint Implementation Team, an
industrywide committee that has developed a plan to arm pilots. It's
similar, he said, to a report the FBI issued last year on cockpit
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for volunteers to take a five-day, 48-hour training
course in which they'll fire off 2,000 rounds of ammunition. At the
end of the training, pilots will act out a scenario in which a
hijacker storms the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   Aitken doesn't think it will be too hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I could reach over my shoulder with my firearm and hit the door
without even looking," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's been suggested that weapons be stored in the cockpit,
Aitken said pilots want to carry their guns, preferably semiautomatic
pistols, with no limits on ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he said, "we give guns to USDA meat inspectors, forest
rangers and postal inspectors."</TE>
<TE>   That's the problem, said David Plavin, president of the airport
organization, Airports Council International. For years, airports
have been trying to limit the number of people with guns who have
access to planes.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of us can tell you stories about an armed federal law
enforcement officer falling asleep on a plane, his jacket falls open,
the gun falls out, someone picks it up and goes to another law
enforcement officer, and they barely avoid a shootout," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Plavin said airport managers want to know where the guns will be
kept when they're not on planes and how access to them will be
controlled.</TE>
<TE>   "Are these guys just going to be marching around with sidearms
anywhere ... they want?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Some contend pilots won't need guns because new bulletproof
cockpit doors are to be installed by April.</TE>
<TE>   However, the doors must be opened for bathroom breaks, meals,
relief crews and as part of airline procedures to check equipment,
Aitken said. Pilots would learn how to deal with an attack when
they're outside the cockpit, he said. They'd prefer to be trained at
FBI training facilities or at federally approved firing ranges
throughout the country, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We pilots have never wanted to get into this program because we
were a bunch of sharpshooting gunslingers," he said. "We're very
serious-minded."</TE>

<HD>Port of Seattle Cruising Into the Future</HD>
<DH>As shipping interests exit, the facility has been rebuilt
to cater to the luxury vessels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The future curls around this city's waterfront.</LD>
<LD>   The once-dingy commercial fishing pier at the northern end of
Elliott Bay has been scrubbed and now accepts yachts. The crumbling
piers at the foot of Bell Street, near the famous Pike Place Market,
have been rebuilt for cruise ships and small conventions. And at the
southern edge, on the far side of the Seattle Aquarium, port
officials are laying plans to reconfigure yet another cargo pier for
more cruise ships -- part of the continuing evolution of the Port of
Seattle from shipping hub to tourist center.</LD>
<LD>   While officials here insist that shipping remains a priority,
several large port users have decamped in recent years -- in many
cases for Southern California. And last year, the Port of Tacoma at
the southern edge of Puget Sound for the first time surpassed Seattle
in the number of containers handled, statistics from the American
Assn. of Port Authorities show.</LD>
<TE>   As business exited, a game of musical chairs was spawned on the
Seattle docks, with the remaining tenants moving from older piers to
more modern facilities as they become available, spokesman Mick
Schultz said.</TE>
<TE>   The port is in the midst of investing about $600 million to
upgrade container docks, Schultz said, even as it makes way for more
cruise ships -- envisioning the future as a mix of shipping, tourism,
commercial fishing and pleasure boating.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three years, cruises through Seattle have grown from
negligible -- six ships and 6,600 passengers in 1999 -- to
substantial, with 80 stops and 250,000 passengers this year, port
officials said. Nearly all the ships are bound for Alaska, ferrying
tourists through glacier-lined fjords along the Inside Passage and
Glacier Bay National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, officials expect 100 cruise ship dockings, with as many
as 400,000 passengers. That projected surge in traffic led the Port
of Seattle, which has the authority to levy taxes, on Tuesday to
increase the local property tax rate for the first time in a decade,
hoping to raise $18.2 million for improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Key among them is about $12 million to convert Pier 30, in the
heart of the port's active shipping docks, for use by cruise ships.</TE>
<TE>   The erosion of shipping business through the Seattle port has cost
jobs. Faced with a $20-million drop in revenue, the port underwent
two reorganizations this year and cut about 200 jobs, most in
warehouse operations.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy Finne, spokesman for the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union Local 19, said the union's ranks have decreased from
about 600 just a few years ago to 485 today. Cruise ships, he said,
are a ray of hope.</TE>
<TE>   "We're embracing it," Finne said, explaining that a cruise ship
generates work for about 80 union members each day it's in port. "It
makes a huge difference for six to eight months of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Many forces have been at work in changing the port.</TE>
<TE>   The region's population grew in the 1990s along with the high-tech
boom -- rising about 20%, to 3.56 million people -- which increased
competition for prime Seattle waterfront. As bay-view condos and
apartment buildings have gone up, so too has residential opposition
to port expansions, said Marc J. Hershman, director of the University
of Washington's School of Marine Affairs. That in turn has led to
higher port development costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody looking down on the port is affected by the noise, the
glare and the traffic," Hershman said. "I give the port credit: When
they've developed new terminals, they've done everything humanly
possible to mitigate the impact." He cited one project that had $30
million for noise and light barriers. "It gets expensive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet ports in Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland are farther away
from residential areas and, facing less local opposition, have been
able to grow more cheaply, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, shipping companies and importers have been
consolidating to cut costs in markets that are increasingly
competitive -- giving up regional hubs in places such as Seattle for
larger population centers.</TE>
<TE>   Toy maker Hasbro, for example, is bringing its West Coast
warehouse and distribution operations to Southern California, trading
the Port of Seattle for L.A. and expanding its distribution center in
Ontario. Nissan has made a similar shift, as have some smaller,
independent shipping companies.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism already has changed the face of the waterfront. Over the
last decade, renovation projects have reclaimed blighted and
underused sections. The stretch of docklands near Pike Place Market,
for instance, has given rise to antique shops and restaurants, kitsch
stalls and launch points for boat tours of Puget Sound.</TE>
<TE>   While reinventing the port in some ways means leaving the past
behind, even some local historians applaud the changes; in them they
see economic vitality replacing an irrecoverable way of life.</TE>
<TE>   "The central waterfront has been obsolete as a cargo handling
center since the '70s," said Walter Crowley, the director of
Historylink.org, which traces Seattle history. "Bringing in cruise
ships has been a very important strategy for port properties and the
downtown economy. I think it's a good thing, and long overdue."</TE>

<HD>Improvised Radio May Resolve Fire Problems</HD>
<DH>It could end the kind of communication woes that led to
deaths in trade center collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A powerful radio improvised from $1,000 worth of parts could help
solve the widespread communication problems linked to firefighters'
deaths in the World Trade Center collapse, fire officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The Fire Department is testing a prototype rigged from a
personal-watercraft battery, a camera case and other widely available
parts to correct high-rise communication problems that have vexed
firefighters for years.</LD>
<LD>   The radios were built last spring by a captain in the department's
research and development unit. They worked so well in recent tests
that the Fire Department is expected soon to ask commercial
manufacturers to submit bids for a mass-produced version.</LD>
<TE>   The experimental "post radios" -- about the size of a big lunchbox
and weighing about 20 pounds each -- enable commanders to transmit
vital messages through dozens of floors of high-rise buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The radio has a larger battery and broadcasts a signal 10 times
more powerful than that of the handheld radios every firefighter
carries.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the concept. Everyone is very excited," department
spokesman Frank Gribbon said.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, commanders use handhelds to communicate with other
commanders and firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   The more powerful radios could be used by commanders at the scene
of an emergency. A commander could use the radio to talk to another
commander elsewhere in a high-rise building. That commander could
then also use a powerful radio or handheld to relay the message to
firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   The department has tried for years without success to guarantee
that radio transmissions can reach firefighters in high-rise
buildings, subway tunnels and other difficult locations.</TE>
<TE>   It sent hundreds of new, digital handheld radios into the field in
early 2001 without extensive testing, only to pull them back later in
the year after reports of widespread problems and a mayday call that
went unheard during a Queens house fire.</TE>
<TE>   With the old analog radios in use on Sept. 11, 2001, many
firefighters complained they never heard orders to evacuate the trade
center's north tower before it collapsed, killing more than 100 of
their colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the trade center problems remains unclear. But the
Sept. 11 problems led to calls for a signal-boosting system that
would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The improvised system, which could cost as little as $50,000 to
put in place citywide, has been performing well in both field tests
and elaborate drills, officials say.</TE>

<HD>High Court Poised to Hear 2 Equal Protection Cases</HD>
<DH>In one, race as a 'plus' factor in admission policies is
challenged; the other tests whether gays can be prosecuted for having
sex at home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court is poised to take up major cases on college
affirmative action and gay rights, possibly as early as Monday, that
seek to overturn much-disputed precedents, one the bane of
conservatives and the other a thorn for liberals.</LD>
<LD>   Both cases test the meaning of the Constitution's guarantee of the
"equal protection of the laws."</LD>
<LD>   The first challenges the Bakke decision of 1978, in which the high
court narrowly upheld affirmative action as a way to preserve racial
diversity in higher education.</LD>
<TE>   The Center for Individual Rights, a conservative legal group in
Washington, says "race-based preferences" in college admissions
violate the equal-treatment standard and should be struck down.</TE>
<TE>   The second tests whether gays can be prosecuted for having sex at
home.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, the court in a 5-4 vote upheld the prosecution of two gay
men under a Georgia anti-sodomy law in the case of Bowers vs.
Hardwick.</TE>
<TE>   That case focused on the right to privacy. The Lambda Legal
Defense Fund in New York, a gay rights group, is urging the court to
revisit the Bowers decision and to rule that prosecuting same-sex
couples, but not heterosexuals, for sodomy violates the
equal-treatment standard.</TE>
<TE>   The latest case, Lawrence vs. Texas, arose when two men, John
Lawrence and Tyron Garner, were arrested in a Houston-area apartment
by officers who were responding to a false report of an armed
intruder. Instead, the police arrested the men, and they were fined
$200 for having sex.</TE>
<TE>   "The state should not have that power, and we are asking the
Supreme Court ... to strike down this discriminatory law once and for
all," says Ruth Harlow, Lambda's legal director.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas law criminalizes "deviate sexual intercourse with
another individual of the same sex." Besides Texas, only three other
states -- Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri -- still enforce anti-sodomy
laws that target gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   The gay rights lawyers hope the court's liberal justices will vote
to revisit the issue. Their appeal went before the high court this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the lawyers challenging affirmative action are even
more confident the court's conservative justices are ready to
reconsider the Bakke ruling, a split decision they say has left the
law unclear ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Bakke, a well-qualified white applicant to the UC Davis
medical school, contended in a lawsuit that he was rejected because a
preference was given to black and Latino applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Bakke won in 5-4 decision that said the medical school had
maintained an illegal quota by reserving 16 of its 100 slots for
minority students.</TE>
<TE>   However, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. joined his four more liberal
colleagues to say colleges can consider a student's race as a "plus"
factor so as to bring about diversity in its entering class.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, lawyers for the Center for Individual Rights
have won rulings striking down affirmative action at the University
of Texas law school and at the University of Georgia. The Supreme
Court refused to hear appeals in those cases because school officials
refused to defend their contested admission policies.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the justices have before them a University of Michigan case
that clearly tests whether officials may give an edge to minority
applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Both the law school and the undergraduate campus in Ann Arbor seek
a "critical mass" of black and Latino students. In recent years, from
11% to 17% of the entering law students were black or Latino, a judge
found. While all the applicants who won admission had good records,
it was much harder for white students to gain admission, the judge
said.</TE>
<TE>   This ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the Center of Individual
Rights on behalf of Barbara Grutter, a 43-year-old white applicant to
the law school who was rejected despite a 3.8 grade-point average and
86th percentile ranking on the Law School Admissions Test.</TE>
<TE>   "The practical effect of the law school's policy is
indistinguishable from a straight quota system," said U.S. District
Judge Bernard Friedman in striking down the policy. He also said the
Bakke decision has been overtaken by more recent Supreme Court
rulings knocking down affirmative action in public contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But University of Michigan officials appealed and made clear they
will vigorously defend the policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're urging the court not to turn the clock back on our ability
to assemble a diverse student body," President Mary Sue Coleman said.
She and other officials said racial diversity makes for better
education and helps foster future leaders for the state.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the U.S. appeals court in Cincinnati sided with the
Michigan law school on a 5-4 vote and overturned Friedman's ruling.
To the surprise of many, the appeals court has yet to rule on a
similar challenge to the undergraduate admissions program.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Center for Individual Rights urged the high court
to take up the case of Grutter vs. Bollinger and to throw out the
Bakke decision. They described the Michigan admissions policy as "a
straightforward instance of racial discrimination by a state
institution."</TE>
<TE>   The appeal came before the justices last week, and a veteran civil
rights lawyer who worked on the case said he expects the justices to
take up the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be surprised if they don't take it," says Theodore M. Shaw,
counsel for NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York. "This is the best
case with the best record."</TE>

<HD>Senate Job for Lott's Aide</HD>
<DH>Susan Wells to be secretary, directing the daily operation
of the chamber.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Incoming Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has selected fellow
Mississippian Susan Wells to become secretary of the Senate when the
new Congress convenes in January.</LD>
<LD>   The secretary of the Senate oversees the chamber's day-to-day
operations, including its payroll and clerks, and is among several
top jobs directly controlled by the majority leader.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate is expected to give Wells formal approval for the job
Jan. 7, when the 108th Congress holds its first session.</LD>
<TE>   Wells began working for the Republican Lott in 1974, when he was
in the House, and has been among his top Senate aides for years.</TE>
<TE>   She succeeds Jeri Thomson, who was secretary of the Senate since
July 2001, shortly after Democrats took control of the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Lott also announced that he has chosen Robert Maxwell, a former
Mississippi police officer and Justice Department official, to be
Senate sergeant-at-arms, the chamber's top security post.</TE>
<TE>   Lott will retain Alan Frumin as Senate parliamentarian.</TE>
<TE>   Frumin, parliamentarian from 1987 to 1995 when Democrats ran the
Senate, was named to the job again in May 2001 by Lott. Frumin
succeeded Robert Dove, who was fired after Republicans disagreed with
some of his rulings on budget legislation.</TE>
<TE>   David Schiappa, who has been secretary for the minority, will
continue as secretary for the majority in January, Lott said.</TE>

<HD>Landrieu Swims Against a GOP Tide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Standing beneath a magnolia tree bathed in sunshine, Sen. Mary L.
Landrieu recalled a watery day years ago when her grandmother paddled
up to the family home in a canoe.</LD>
<LD>   The flood of 1978 swamped the house where Landrieu grew up and
turned General Pershing Street into a canal. Landrieu pointed to the
third step of the front porch's stairway and said: "That's how high
the water was -- up to here."</LD>
<LD>   Now another flood laps at Landrieu's feet. It is a GOP tide,
swelled by the popularity of President Bush, that threatens to topple
the first-term Democrat in a runoff election Dec. 7 and give
Louisiana its first Republican senator since Reconstruction ended in
1877.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans wrested the Senate from Democratic control Nov. 5, but
only by a slim margin. In the year's final Senate race, for the 100th
seat, Landrieu faces Republican Suzanne Haik Terrell to determine
whether the GOP majority will hold at 51 seats or grow to 52.</TE>
<TE>   Adding a seat would give Republicans a cushion to guard against a
sudden Democratic takeover, such as occurred last year when Sen.
James M. Jeffords of Vermont quit the GOP and became an independent.
A Republican win also would add to the political momentum the party
gained from the midterm results.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu, though, is no pushover. She was easily the top
vote-getter in the nine-person Senate race Nov. 5, though she was
forced into the runoff by falling short of the 50% mark.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of a former New Orleans mayor and Carter
administration Cabinet secretary, she began her own political career
in her mid-20s. She served in the state Legislature and as state
treasurer. In 1996, she won a close Senate race that was subsequently
challenged by an opponent, who alleged massive vote fraud in New
Orleans. The Senate dismissed the charge.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, she has compiled a centrist voting record tailored
to the state's political leanings. She also has pushed federal money
toward Louisiana as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee
-- including flood-control aid that she touted during a news
conference at her old home.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush, who helped engineer the Senate takeover by campaigning
for Republicans successfully in Georgia, Missouri, Minnesota and
elsewhere, hopes to replicate the feat here. The president is
scheduled to swing through the state Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   If Terrell wins, it would be an emphatic finale to an
already-rousing year for the GOP. It would also mark another stage in
the Republican consolidation of power in what Democrats once called
their "solid South."</TE>
<TE>   What makes the runoff especially volatile is that no one knows how
many people will come to the polls on a Saturday in December. In
previous years, Louisiana runoffs coincided with the usual November
election day elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new calendar, political experts are pondering these wild
cards: Will football fans be distracted if Louisiana State University
lands in a conference title game that day in Atlanta? Will the gun
enthusiasts who like to hunt not vote because hunting season opens
Dec. 7? Most important, will black voters in New Orleans rally as
strongly for Landrieu this year as they did in 1996, a presidential
election when Bill Clinton headed the Democratic ticket?</TE>
<TE>   "We're in uncharted waters," said Wayne Parent, a Louisiana State
political scientist. "We don't know whether one high-profile race
will turn people out."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, Landrieu won 46% of the vote in the nine-candidate
field. Three Republicans combined for 51% of the vote. Terrell led
that trio with 27%.</TE>
<TE>   In the Landrieu view, the results showed her not far from victory.
In the Terrell view, she will win if she can consolidate the
Republican vote.</TE>
<TE>   Polling has failed to dispel the murk. Public surveys have shown
the incumbent with an edge, but their reliability is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The two foes bear some similarities. Both are Catholics from New
Orleans. Terrell, 48, the state elections commissioner, pledges
fealty to Bush on most issues.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu, 47, has backed the president on war (voting for the Iraq
use-of-force resolution), on taxes (voting for his $1.35-trillion tax
cut) and on energy (voting to drill for oil in part of the Alaska
wildlife refuge).</TE>
<TE>   Terrell has assumed an unusual role for a challenger, emerging as
the Washington insider and touting her close ties to Republicans in
power.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney and incoming Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi have stumped for her in advance of Bush.
Before the primary, she won critical backing from the National
Republican Senatorial Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu is running as the outsider. She depicts herself as an
independent and has shunned joint appearances with national
Democratic figures in an effort to avoid being labeled a liberal. The
only prominent Democrat at her side is the state's senior senator,
John B. Breaux, who, like Landrieu, often votes with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Breaux acknowledged the political potency of Air Force One. Bush
"showed that all over the country" on Nov. 5, Breaux said. "But he's
not invincible."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans predict Bush will put Terrell over the top. At an
event in Baton Rouge that raised $100,000 for her, many were yearning
to break the Democratic stranglehold on the state's two Senate seats.</TE>
<TE>   "We've finally realized -- why are we the only state in the South
that always elects Democratic senators?" said Rolfe McCollister, a
magazine publisher and GOP donor. "Why don't we have at least one?
Why are we out of step?"</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu and Terrell have conducted a series of televised debates
that have spotlighted policy differences and been marked by flashes
of personal animosity.</TE>
<TE>   In one exchange in Baton Rouge, Landrieu said Terrell had been a
lobbyist for a foreign drug company and asked viewers: "Which one of
us, if sent to Washington, would do a better job of keeping drug
prices down?"</TE>
<TE>   Terrell shot back: "There she goes again. There's just so little
Mary can actually say about me. She has taken plenty of money from
drug companies."</TE>
<TE>   In a clash in New Orleans, Terrell stressed her opposition to
abortion and accused Landrieu, who favors limited abortion rights, of
abandoning the Roman Catholic faith. Landrieu called the attack a
smear. In an off-camera remark overheard by reporters, she told
Terrell: "This is your last campaign."</TE>

<HD>Predatory Snakehead Fish Is Vanquished, Officials Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The state of Maryland has declared victory in its war on snakeheads,
the aquatic invaders whose bristling teeth and ability to migrate by
land made them the real-life equivalent of summer horror-movie
creatures.</LD>
<LD>   After a final round of tests this month at a rural Maryland pond
found no trace of the fish, Maryland wildlife officials said they
plan to ask the Legislature next year to tighten standards and
scrutiny of snakeheads and other predators.</LD>
<LD>   "We're pretty confident they're eradicated," said Eric Schwab,
director of Maryland's Department of Natural Resources Fisheries
Service. Schwab said wildlife officials expect to "be in direct
discussions with the state Legislature about providing more control
over the movement of nonnative species in and around the state."</LD>
<TE>   Sporting teeth as sharp as dog fangs and able to flop across dry
land, the Asian-origin northern snakeheads stunned officials in May
not only by their startling emergence in a pond near the town of
Crofton, but also by their rapid procreation. Two years after two
adult snakeheads were apparently dumped into the pond, more than 100
of the bulky fish were hauled out by state officials during the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   The state's quick action to combat the snakeheads before they
spread to other waterways impressed scientists who have long urged a
faster response against wildlife invaders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a textbook case of what we should be doing," said David
Lodge, a University of Notre Dame ecologist who is on a federal panel
planning strategies to stem the flow of foreign wildlife and aquatic
interlopers. "By the time we hear about most of these cases, it's
usually too late to do anything more than keep their numbers under
control."</TE>
<TE>   Infamous for their appetite for other fish populations, more than
17,000 of the scaly snakeheads have been imported into the U.S. in
recent years -- some as pets, others as prized meals in Asian
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   By July, media accounts about the daunting-looking snakeheads
found in Maryland had captured national attention and spurred
official action. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton announced plans to
place snakeheads on a federal watch list as a "most-wanted" predator.
In Maryland, state biologists dumped herbicides and fish poison into
the Crofton pond to kill plant life and choke the snakeheads before
they multiplied.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab said state wildlife officials are now so certain of their
victory over the snakeheads that they do not plan further eradication
measures next year. "We're not planning any more direct samplings,"
Schwab said. "We don't think there are any snakeheads left, but if
there are, they'll show up in our routine samplings."</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to persuade political leaders to back
recommendations made by an advisory panel last summer to give the
state more flexibility in fighting wildlife invaders.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the recommendations will be politically acceptable, said
Donald F. Boesch, who heads Maryland's Snakehead Scientific Advisory
Panel. Boesch, an estuary sciences expert at the University of
Maryland, said the state needs to toughen its legal line of defense
against aquatic predators.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland law bans importing or introducing non-indigenous fish
species into state waterways, Boesch said, but a loophole fails to
cover those who spread the invaders by accident or negligence.</TE>
<TE>   "State agencies and the [Department of Natural Resources] need a
more solid basis to act when they have to," Boesch said.</TE>
<TE>   But state officials are less certain about whether they will be
able to persuade Maryland's new governor, Robert L. Ehrlich, to back
another of the panel's recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   The panel urged that Maryland's Department of Natural Resources be
granted more authority "to take steps to eradicate or control the
spread of prohibited species even when the fish are in tanks or ponds
on private property." They acknowledged that those steps might
require court orders.</TE>
<TE>   "When there is a clear danger, we felt it was appropriate for the
state to go in and do what's necessary," Boesch said.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said they are unsure whether that recommendation
will be supported by Ehrlich, a Republican congressman who sometimes
sided with property-rights interests in House votes.</TE>
<TE>   The new governor "will want to strike a careful balance between
property-rights needs and any proposal that takes an active position
on public health rights," said Henry Fawell, Ehrlich's spokesman. But
Fawell cautioned that any move would not "come at the expense of
property rights."</TE>
<TE>   Boesch and state wildlife officials hope a compromise can be found
by offering property owners compensation for damage incurred when the
state moves against wildlife invaders.</TE>
<TE>   That is already the case with the Crofton pond invaded by the
snakehead, Schwab said. Once poison levels fade in the privately
owned pond, officials plan to restock it with catfish, pickerel and
large-mouthed bass -- the fish that swam there before they were
joined by lurking snakeheads.</TE>

<HD>States Challenge Bush on Embryonic Stem-Cell Research</HD>
<DH>Bills would encourage scientific study. They also would
permit some cloning for lab tests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Following California's lead, lawmakers in at least three other states
will take up proposals next year to encourage research on stem cells
taken from human embryos. The measures would also permit scientists
to use cloning to produce human embryos for stem-cell experiments.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation is a challenge to President Bush, who favors a
federal ban on cloning and has set rules that limit embryonic
stem-cell research. Congress is expected to revisit a proposal next
year to outlaw human cloning for any purpose.</LD>
<LD>   In New Jersey, a bill supporting embryonic stem-cell research won
approval in a Senate panel Monday, and a similar bill was introduced
Nov. 19 in Pennsylvania. Aides to Massachusetts lawmakers say a bill
will be introduced there next week.</LD>
<TE>   Similar proposals could turn up in other states, as most
legislatures have just begun to lay out their agendas for next year.</TE>
<TE>   In most states, embryonic stem-cell and cloning research is
already legal, when funded with private money. But by explicitly
authorizing the research, the bills aim to encourage investors who
may have been driven away from stem-cell companies by fears that the
federal government will restrict the research.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent is to bring as many research people into the state as
we can," said state Sen. Richard J. Codey, a Democrat and
co-president of the Senate in New Jersey, home to many pharmaceutical
and bioresearch firms. "If this in fact passes, money will flow into
the state and those firms. This sends a message that we want
[stem-cell research] to start and continue in our state." He said the
research holds hope for curing a range of diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Similar motives prompted California lawmakers to pass a measure
this year supporting embryonic stem-cell research; Gov. Gray Davis
signed the bill in September. The Biotechnology Industry Assn., a
trade group, sent the California law to its affiliates in 35 states
and suggested they try to pass similar measures across the country.</TE>
<TE>   At least 30 states considered cloning-related laws this year, most
of them supported by antiabortion groups and social conservatives who
want to restrict or ban the research.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa, Michigan and Virginia in recent years have banned cloning
for any purpose, while Louisiana, Rhode Island and California ban
cloning to initiate a pregnancy. A handful of other states have laws
protecting embryos, which might be interpreted as barring embryonic
stem-cell experiments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the pro-research side has realized that we have to work a
little harder in the states, but it is an uphill battle for us," said
Sean Tipton, a vice president of the Coalition for the Advancement of
Medical Research, which favors embryonic stem-cell work.
"Traditionally, the other side has been much better organized in
state capitals, because they are used to fighting the abortion
battles on the state level."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Doerflinger of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops
said he sees little significance in states supporting embryonic
stem-cell work, because it is already legal.</TE>
<TE>   "What's significant is that, despite the claims of the research
community that cloning means medical progress, a number of states are
moving to ban cloning and, in some cases, ban embryo research
generally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Embryonic stem cells have drawn intense interest because they are
able to morph into any type of cell in the human body. Scientists say
the embryo cells are yielding a treasure trove of data about the
basics of human biology, as well as clues as to how to cure
Parkinson's disease, diabetes and other ailments.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bush said that taxpayer money, which funds the bulk of
U.S. medical research, could be used for experiments on only a narrow
set of stem cells that had been taken from human embryos before Aug.
9, 2001. Bush said a broader policy would be immoral, because it
would cause more human embryos to be destroyed for their stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, Congress will consider proposals to ban all human
cloning. While there is broad support for a ban on cloning intended
to produce children, some lawmakers, scientists and patient groups
say cloning should be a legal tool for producing human embryos for
their stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, antiabortion groups and others favor a total ban. Without
it, they say, the federal government would be permitting the creation
of human embryos through cloning -- then mandating that those embryos
be destroyed, as growing them to term would be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   They say equally promising research can be conducted without
ethical problems by using cells taken from adults, although some
scientists dispute this.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) won the support of 40 to 50 senators
this year for a total cloning ban, congressional aides said. That was
short of the 60 votes needed to move legislation in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, Brownback is expected to have at least three additional
votes, when Republicans Elizabeth Hanford Dole of North Carolina,
Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Jim Talent of Missouri join the Senate.
That still would leave Brownback short of 60 votes, but lawmakers who
lack strong views might be swung to Brownback's side by a popular
president and the Senate's new GOP leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's clear that Sen. Brownback still does not have the
votes to pass his irresponsibly drafted cloning prohibition," Tipton
said.</TE>
<TE>   A comprehensive federal ban would trump state laws that permit
cloning as a medical research tool. However, research advocates would
likely take the matter to court.</TE>
<TE>   While the proposals vary, the state measures generally would do
the following:</TE>
<TE>   * Outlaw cloning intended to produce a child.</TE>
<TE>   * Authorize stem-cell research, including work using adult stem
cells, cells from unused fertility clinic embryos and cells from
embryos created through cloning.</TE>
<TE>   * Require doctors to tell patients that a fertility treatment may
leave them with unused embryos, and that the embryos may be donated
for research, donated to other fertility patients or placed in frozen
storage.</TE>
<TE>   * Ban the sale of embryonic or fetal tissue, other than to recoup
"reasonable" costs.</TE>
<TE>   * Require stem-cell experiments to be reviewed by a local ethics
board or state agency, a practice that currently is not mandatory for
some privately funded experiments.</TE>

<HD>Overtime Pay for Chicago Teachers Is Investigated</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Three teachers who each took home more than $60,000 in overtime pay
last year are under investigation by the Chicago Board of Education.</LD>
<LD>   It is unclear whether the Chicago teachers did anything wrong, but
school officials said they plan reforms to prevent "excessive"
overtime payments. They have been removed from the projects that
generated the overtime.</LD>
<LD>   "This kind of practice will not be tolerated," said schools chief
Arne Duncan.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, one teacher made $73,549 in overtime on top of her
$80,355 salary, according to school records published Thursday by the
Chicago Tribune. Another teacher added $63,036 in overtime to her
$80,355 salary, and the third teacher took home $88,428 in overtime
and $55,277 in salary.</TE>
<TE>   A Chicago schools spokesman said projects that have generated lots
of overtime pay for teachers will be assigned during regular hours.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>City officials began warning drivers months in advance with flashing
road signs, posters, even government-sponsored television programs:
Wacker Drive, one of downtown's primary arteries, would be closed,
shut down for nearly two years.</LD>
<LD>   Please, the messages seemed to plead, prepare yourself. This one

<LD>   When the 76-year-old double-decker roadway reopened this week --

<TE>   During a time when other large public works projects around the
country have dragged on and run enormously over budget -- such as Los
Angeles' subways, a considerably larger effort -- a few residents
here even grew fond of the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured out some back-alley routes and got to work faster,"
said Michael Greene, who works at one of the many hotels along the
route. "It's good that it's back open, but it really wasn't that bad
when it was closed."</TE>
<TE>   A good part of the credit for that kind of sentiment should go to
transportation officials, who at one point went so far as to lower a
bridge for an anxious bride who was worried about the aesthetics of
her wedding photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Wacker enjoys almost none of the glitz and name recognition of
Michigan Avenue, Chicago's most famous street, with its high-end
shopping stretch, the Magnificent Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Conceived in 1909 as part of a so-called Chicago Plan that has
helped shape much of the nation's third-largest city, Wacker is a
street of function before fashion, a way for commuters and delivery
vehicles to cut more swiftly through the heart of Chicago, an area
that has become severely congested during a nearly two-decade
building boom.</TE>
<TE>   Named for Charles H. Wacker, chairman of the Chicago Plan
Commission at the time of its construction, the roadway ferries
vehicles and pedestrians along a route arcing southwest to northeast
through the Loop and downtown, emptying onto the Michigan Lake-front
thoroughfare, Lakeshore Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Although visitors see and travel the more adorned upper level, it
is perhaps the shaded bottom half, which runs 25 feet below most of
the city, that is lovelier to planning and engineering wonks.</TE>
<TE>   More than 36,000 vehicles travel Lower Wacker Drive each day, many
of them semitrailer trucks and delivery vehicles that service 57
high-rise buildings along the route. In a netherworld populated by
the homeless in winter and dockworkers year-round, the vehicles
disgorge hundreds of tons of meat, cleaning supplies and replacement
boilers each day, without blocking the surface streets above.</TE>
<TE>   About 6,000 more vehicles travel the mostly hidden Lower Wacker
each day than Upper Wacker.</TE>
<TE>   The route opened in 1926, and after nearly seven decades of heavy
use, officials decided in the mid-1990s that makeshift repairs were
no longer enough. The upper level was crumbling onto the lower, which
was full of potholes and difficult corners; deteriorating columns
were keeping the upper level aloft.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of a letter-writing campaign from businesses that
would be affected by construction but later, they hoped, benefit from
the improvements, the city secured about two-thirds of the $200
million for construction from the federal government, the rest from
the state.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Department of Transportation then launched a public
relations blitz.</TE>
<TE>   "A key to the success was telling people what was coming before it
came, telling them again when it arrived, and telling them once more
when it was gone," said Stan Kaderbek, the department's chief
engineer and head of the project.</TE>
<TE>   The department set up a Web site for the project, offered advice
about alternative bus routes, produced maps of the makeshift plywood
alleyways, and placed strict timelines on aspects of the project so
that businesses and residents would be inconvenienced for only a few
months rather than for the duration of the work.</TE>
<TE>   At the Renaissance Hotel, which at one point had three of its four
entrances blocked, the city removed a light pole so the hotel could
create a new entrance and altered construction hours to provide
guests a little more sleeping time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to tell you my business wasn't affected. It was
affected," General Manager Paige Koerbel said. "But almost every time
we had a concern, the city responded, and very well."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone has been pleased. "Horrible. Stupid," snapped a
man in his waiter's outfit as he hurried past reopening ceremonies
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaderbek got only two serious, unfixable noise complaints
during the rebuilding, he said. And kudos, rare in the public-works
business, have been surprisingly numerous.</TE>
<TE>   The bride with the eye for backdrops had her reception at the
Renaissance during a time when the city had raised a bridge across
the adjacent Chicago River to keep pedestrians from crossing into the
construction zone. It was going to rise right up into her wedding
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "We put the bridge down," Kaderbek said. "Far be it from me to
ruin her day."</TE>

<HD>Study: Odd Gait May Be a Sign of Senility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Abnormal walking patterns in the elderly may be an early warning sign
of senility, researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   Senior citizens with an odd gait are about 3 1/2 times more likely
than others to develop forms of dementia other than Alzheimer's
disease, according to a study in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Patients with such abnormal gaits could be given blood-pressure
drugs and other medication and put on diets to prevent a stroke and
ward off vascular dementia, said lead researcher Joe Verghese, an
assistant neurology professor at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Strokes are the main cause of vascular dementia, the second-most
common form of dementia after Alzheimer's. It strikes roughly 1.5
million Americans over age 65. The researchers found that abnormal
gait also was a strong predictor of some rarer forms of dementia, but
not of Alzheimer's disease.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there is no reliable medical test for predicting who
will develop dementia. But doctors look at such factors as whether
the patient has suffered strokes or whether members of the family had
dementia.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that there is a progressive brain disease taking
place. At low levels, it affects gait, so abnormal walking is an
early sign," Verghese said. "This study's probably one of the first
studies that have used a clinical finding to predict who's going to
develop vascular dementia."</TE>
<TE>   The findings do not concern the many seniors whose walking
problems have physical causes.</TE>
<TE>   For about seven years, Verghese and colleagues followed 422 people
in their 70s, 80s and 90s who did not have dementia when the study
began.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly one-third of the 85 who began the study with an abnormal
gait developed vascular or other non-Alzheimer's dementia, compared
with less than one-tenth of those with normal gaits.</TE>
<TE>   Verghese said analysis of a patient's gait could be combined with
an evaluation of mental sharpness and the development of better
brain-imaging technology to more accurately predict who will suffer
dementia.</TE>

<LD>With his wife out of town because of a family emergency, Coach Alvin
Gentry sent his two young sons to their nanny's home for Thanksgiving
dinner and hunkered down at Staples Center, trying to make sense of
the team's struggles.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't eaten all day," he said. "It's a lot easier to eat when
you're 10-5 [as the New Jersey Nets were before Thursday's game
against the Clippers] than when you're 5-10 [the Clippers' record]."</LD>
<LD>   After watching miles of videotape and crunching numbers, Gentry
came up with an obvious solution.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers must play better and put the ball in the basket more
often in the fourth quarter if they hope to escape from the slump
that's threatened their playoff hopes.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had a lead in the fourth quarter in 12 of their first
15 games but faded down the stretch because of careless play with the
ball and a failure to shoot well enough to win.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is we've got to make plays," Gentry said. "We've
got to make free throws. We've gotten great looks at the basket.
We've just got to step up. We've got to get the ball in the basket at
the end of games."</TE>
<TE>   They were much improved Thursday against the Nets, making 10 of 18
shots in the fourth quarter and scoring 34 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Lawler called his 1,800th game as the voice of the Clippers.

<TE>   Ridden by Victor Espinoza for owner California Racing Stable and
trainer Paulo Lobo, the 5-year-old Brazilian bred mare closed strong

<HD>Price Is Ready to State Its Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a trying first season during which his team won one more game
than it lost, Los Angeles Price High boys' basketball Coach Michael
Lynch wrote that he "went before the Lord in prayer, asking that he
send student-athletes to Price High from the north, south, east and
west."</LD>
<LD>   That was in 1997. Over the next five years, he recalled in an
article for an inspirational newsletter, his prayers were answered
... and then some.</LD>
<LD>   From the north came guards Paul Simon of Los Angeles Fairfax and
Derrick Williams of North Hollywood Campbell Hall. From the south
came guard Chris Alexander of Hawthorne Light and Life Christian
School. From the east came forward Kalief Washington of Rosemead. And
from the west came guards David Pendleton and Frank Peace of
Westchester.</LD>
<TE>   With its throng of transfers in place, Price established a
tradition of excellence rivaled in Southern California only by
Compton Dominguez. Heading into their season opener on Monday, the
Knights have won four consecutive Southern Section titles and three
state championships in a row, becoming only the second team besides
Dominguez to accomplish the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Price could become the first team in California to win four
consecutive state titles with another victory in late March at
Sacramento's Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Still, players and coaches at the tiny school (enrollment: 70)
attribute their success to much more than an influx of talent,
however massive. They contend that their religious faith and
steadfast acceptance of each other have allowed them to dominate
other schools in Division V -- the smallest in California -- with
enrollments two and three times their size.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our faith in each other and in what we believe that has
brought us to this point," said Lynch, 43, a former Los Angeles
Police Dept. detective who came to Price straight out of the Amateur
Athletic Union coaching ranks. "I came here with no high school
[coaching] experience, so it cannot be that Coach Lynch is this
tremendous Xs and O's man. And I haven't had the impact transfer that
has been mind-boggling."</TE>
<TE>   "Faith" is the word of choice on the pristine Price campus,
located at the sprawling Crenshaw Christian Center on an otherwise
squalid stretch of Vermont Avenue between Florence and Manchester
boulevards in South Central Los Angeles. Administrators beamingly
refer to the gated complex as "an oasis," though the high school is a
somewhat pricey sanctuary considering its yearly tuition of $4,200.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-acre center encompasses preschool through high school and a
ministry run by Frederick K.C. Price, one of the nation's most
influential African American televangelists. Price delivers his
sermons every Sunday morning at 9:30 in the FaithDome, a geodesic
structure that seats 10,145.</TE>
<TE>   Several Price players, among them Williams, a senior guard who
transferred after his sophomore year, attend services at the
FaithDome, though the only religious entrance requirement at Price is
that students believe in Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Since Lynch's arrival, fans regularly pack the team's 1,400-seat,
state-of-the-art gym. That's what happens when your team posts 65
victories over two seasons, as the Knights did from 2000-2002.</TE>
<TE>   Hoops hysteria has reached such a pitch that only five of the
school's 42 boys didn't try out for either the varsity or junior
varsity teams this season.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch's up-tempo, guard-oriented style results in breathless,
high-scoring games that often render seats unnecessary. The Knights
love to trap and employ full-court pressure on defense, creating
turnovers and additional scoring opportunities that, as Lynch put it,
"will equal out our bad-shooting games."</TE>
<TE>   This season's team has already garnered national acclaim, featured
as one of "25 teams to watch" in Street &amp; Smith's preseason
basketball guide.</TE>
<TE>   Price has three returning starters, led by Williams and 6-foot-5
senior forward Oscar Edwards, who could become the first player to be
a part of four California state-title teams. Edwards averaged 12
points and nine rebounds last season and was an all-state Division V
selection along with Williams, who averaged 15 points and three
steals. Also returning is point guard Paul Simon, the Knights' best
on-the-ball defender, who averaged nine points and five assists.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, a friendly and gregarious man crowned by a clean pate, does
his best to de-emphasize statistics and individual achievements in an
effort to foster team unity. Observers such as Randolph Simpson,
assistant principal and athletic director at Price, say the approach
is key to the team's success.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson should know. He used similar tactics to win three City
Section titles as coach at Los Angeles Manual Arts.</TE>
<TE>   "[Lynch] has taken a team with not a lot of superstars, but a lot
of guys who work together as a cohesive unit and gotten them to
achieve and believe in themselves," Simpson said. "He preaches the
team effort, that everybody is an intricate part of this team, from
the first man to the 15th man. That's important because you have to
build that camaraderie."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said this season's schedule might be the toughest in school
history.</TE>
<TE>   Price, which under Lynch has never scheduled teams in its division
before league competition in an attempt to strengthen itself for the
playoffs, plays Gardena Serra, Los Angeles Verbum Dei and could face
Los Angeles Dorsey and Long Beach Poly in tournament action.</TE>
<TE>   If Price wins another state title, Lynch and his players will
complete what has become an annual rite of winter: marching in front
of the FaithDome congregation to a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Said Edwards: "We've already declared that we're going to win the
state championship. We're going to get it done."</TE>

<LD>SOUTHERN SECTION QUARTERFINALS</LD>
<LD>   Rialto Eisenhower (7-4) vs. Long Beach Poly (10-1) at Veterans
Stadium, Long Beach, 7:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The excitement of a late-season winning streak and a victory over
Anaheim Servite in the first round has been tempered by the news of
Eisenhower first-year Coach Glenn Thompkins' arrest Tuesday on
suspicion of having a sexual relationship with a minor. Athletic
Director Tom Hoak, who stepped down as coach last year after 19
seasons, will return to the sidelines Friday as acting coach on a
"day-to-day" basis, with assistant Keith Bailey serving as offensive
coordinator. "We're going to practice and we're going to play
[tonight]. We're going to concentrate on football and let the
off-the-field issues take care of themselves," Hoak said. Jarrell
Browne and Anthony Manning power Eisenhower's running game. They
combined for 251 yards against Servite last week. Poly easily won a
rematch of last year's Division I championship game against
Huntington Beach Edison. The Jackrabbits limited Oklahoma-bound
quarterback Tommy Grady to 44 yards passing, while speedy wide
receiver Derrick Jones caught eight passes for 200 yards and three
touchdowns.</LD>

<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei (8-3) vs. Anaheim Esperanza (10-1) at Cal
State Fullerton, 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   As frequently as these teams advance to the postseason, they've
managed to avoid each other all but two times since 1973. They split
those games and haven't met in the postseason since Esperanza
switched to Division I in 1994. Esperanza will be trying to keep the
season going for Coach Gary Meek, who is retiring to become athletic
director. Both teams feature balanced offensive attacks, rolling up
more than 40 points in easy opening-round victories last week.
Confidence should be soaring on both sides of the field.</TE>

<TE>   Bellflower St. John Bosco (9-2) vs. Los Angeles Loyola (8-3) at
Glendale High, 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   When St. John Bosco defeated Loyola, 26-14, in a Serra League game
in Week 8, it ended a 14-game losing streak against the Cubs. The
teams have never met in the playoffs, but the last time the Braves
defeated Loyola twice in a row was in 1980-81. The Cubs hold a 23-5
edge in the series, but this is a different St. John Bosco team. It
went undefeated in one of the toughest leagues in the state and won
its first league title since 1986. Led by running back Derrick
Williams and receiver Joe Cowan, the Braves are on an eight-game
winning streak. Loyola seems to have regrouped after a mid-season
slump, winning three of its last four with running back Bo Renaud
pacing the attack.</TE>

<TE>   Los Alamitos (10-0-1) at La Puente Bishop Amat (6-5), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   It's already been a season to remember for Los Alamitos. Will it
continue in a Division I quarterfinal? John Barnes became the
winningest coach in Orange County football history this month (he has
216 victories), and the Griffins have been on a tear for most of the
season. The blemish is a 21-21, season-opening tie against Newhall
Hart. Brandon Tripp and Jeremy Childs are the latest in a long line
of standout receivers for the Griffins. Bishop Amat barely made it
here. After finishing with a 2-3 record in the Serra League, the
Lancers needed two overtimes to beat Redlands in the first round,
42-35. In that game, Andrew Soto ran for 152 yards and four
touchdowns, and was one of three Bishop Amat players to have more
than 100 yards rushing.</TE>

<TE>   Mission Viejo (11-0) at Canyon Country Canyon (10-1), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Last school year, Canyon eliminated Mission Viejo in the boys'
basketball and baseball playoffs. This will be a tough task in
football. The Diablos have a 25-game winning streak and one of the
best defenses in Southern California. Quarterback Josh Rodarmel
injured his shoulder last week against Diamond Bar but is expected to
play. Canyon has the kind of offensive balance to threaten the
Diablos with junior quarterback Nate Longshore and junior running
back Louis Montano leading the way.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Foothill (9-2) at La Mirada (8-3), 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   La Mirada beat Foothill in the second round last year, 48-25, but
only two starters return on offense. The Matadores must control the
clock with workhorse Garrett Busk, who has rushed 228 times for 1,131
yards and 13 touchdowns in 10 games. He missed last week's game with
a sprained knee. Behind quarterback Don Poole, who has passed for 18
touchdowns, and running back Mike Liti, who has rushed for 22,
Foothill has averaged 32.6 points while allowing 18.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gardena Serra (11-0) at Temple City (8-3), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   This Division X quarterfinal features well-matched teams that have
relied on the run. In its last five games, Temple City has averaged
37 points while allowing 13. Serra averages 28 points while giving up
12. Temple City's Desmond Reed is a potential game-breaker who has
1,022 yards and 15 touchdowns rushing, 52 receptions for 809 yards
and a score, four kickoff returns, four punt returns and one
interception return for scores. Ryan Kelley has rushed for more than
200 yards in each of Serra's last two games and has 1,410 yards
rushing and 13 touchdowns.</TE>

<LD>For those who wonder if playing high school sports is worth the
sacrifice in blood, sweat and tears, let me introduce you to some
individuals who continue to call upon lessons learned as teenagers
for inspiration and guidance.</LD>
<LD>   Rocky Delgadillo was the student body president at Los Angeles
Franklin High. He played football, basketball, baseball and ran
track. He went to Harvard, earned his law degree from Columbia and
came home to make a difference in his community.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, at 41, he was elected city attorney of Los Angeles.
People are already touting him as a future mayor or attorney general.</LD>
<TE>   He still keeps in touch with his coaches at Franklin and has never
forgotten how sports experiences helped put him on the path to
success.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing sports in high school was a significant character-builder
for me," he said. "[My coaches] taught me what it means to have big
dreams and achieve them. Those dreams require hard work, team work
and tenacity. I learned what it feels like to win and I learned what
it feels like to lose. Character matters as much as talent. Those
kind of lessons have served me well."</TE>
<TE>   As Los Angeles' top prosecutor, Delgadillo is trying to find ways
to keep teenagers out of trouble. He learned, firsthand, the value of
sports and after-school activities growing up in Highland Park.
Sports kept him busy and off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing high school sports taught me is when bad things do
happen, it's important to get right back out there so failure won't
set in," he said. "Failure is only temporary unless you allow it to
be permanent."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Randy Redell played quarterback at Encino Crespi in 1985. He went
to the Air Force Academy, became an F-16 pilot and has climbed the
ranks to major.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, he was selected to join the Thunderbirds, one of the
Air Force's most prestigious honors. He'll be one of eight pilots
flying F-16s at air shows across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I am living a dream," he said. "I found out June 6 and my feet
haven't touched the ground yet."</TE>
<TE>   From the time he graduated from high school, making the
Thunderbirds had been his goal. High school sports prepared him for
the long road he needed to travel.</TE>
<TE>   "Football taught me discipline, perseverance, a service mentality
that carried me through the academy and pilot training," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He called the football field "a leadership laboratory" to help him
develop ideas and instincts for adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sean Sterle was a Southern Section player of the year as a
quarterback for Panorama City St. Genevieve in 1982. In the 1990s, he
decided he wanted to become an FBI agent.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, he was
working every day, 12 to 16 hours each day, trying to protect
Americans. The stress level was high, as was the pressure to produce
results.</TE>
<TE>   It made him reflect on his days as a quarterback, when he had to
maintain his composure no matter how difficult the challenge seemed.</TE>
<TE>   "It helped me deal with an urgent task that's very important, but
keep a level head," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sterle draws upon his playing experiences to help him in law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Working cases, you're always trying to figure out ways to catch
criminals," he said. "As a quarterback, you're always persevering,
working hard, trying to improve and hoping it would pay off.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be setbacks. You have to readjust, get back in
there and fight. Even the disappointment of losing a championship
taught me to work harder."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rocky Balch played football and baseball at Huntington Beach
Edison. He graduated in 1990, received an appointment to the U.S.
Military Academy, became an Army helicopter pilot, then tried to
enter medical school.</TE>
<TE>   He was rejected the first time. He didn't give up. That was
something his coaches at Edison taught him. He's graduating this year
from the University of Texas medical school, then will begin a
five-year residency program in general surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports has taught me if you work hard enough and put enough
effort into it and ... don't give up, you'll get there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports has given me the confidence to do things people don't
think are easy. It's given me the fortitude to stay the course."</TE>
<TE>   Balch has encountered difficult situations, such as a
malfunctioning helicopter engine, which forced him to make a quick
judgment without panicking. Again, high school sports provided a good
training environment.</TE>
<TE>   "You're able to keep your composure and figure out what needs to
be done," he said. "Hopefully, for surgery, it will prove the same
way. When you're opening someone's abdomen and something happens, you
have to keep your cool. You don't want a surgeon standing over you
freaking out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Bowne, 24, is in his second year of law school at Pepperdine.
As quarterback, he led Sherman Oaks Notre Dame to the 1994 Southern
Section Division III championship.</TE>
<TE>   He's grateful for his sports experience because he believes it
helped him pass the Law School Admission Test.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an all-or-nothing test," he said. "Doing well on the test is
being able to sit down and deal with pressure, not worrying how much
you're going to get wrong. It's similar to trying to calm yourself in
the stretch of a football game, when you have to get a touchdown to
win the game and ignore the outside influences and focus on the task
at hand."</TE>
<TE>   After he passes the bar exam, he'll practice estate planning and
keep remembering those treasured moments on the football field.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge correlation between the lessons you learn playing
on an organized team and later on in life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Usher Barnum was the standout running back on Chatsworth's 1980
unbeaten City 3-A championship team.</TE>
<TE>   He became a career naval officer. He's a lieutenant commander
based in Okinawa, Japan. His job is to fly in P-3 reconnaissance
aircraft. He's the one who pushes the button to release weapons when
chasing submarines.</TE>
<TE>   "The selfless dedication and teamwork in high school sports
prepared me the most to be a career naval officer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a running back, he had to make decisions whether to charge
through a hole or bounce outside and take a chance at trying to elude
a defender. He trusted his instincts and football knowledge. It's the
same in the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes looking for a submarine doesn't go according to plan,
but you have to do something," he said. "You can't just freeze up in
the plane and come home with no explanations as to what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Oftentimes, there is a conflict or the information isn't as clear
as we had hoped. I still have to make a decision on what to do and be
able to back up my decision when I land."</TE>
<TE>   Communication and decision-making are used every day in life, and
the athletic field is the perfect training ground.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Based primarily in New York, Todd Pletcher consistently wins at a
high percentage. At last glance, he was scoring at a 22% rate in 2002
and is near the top of the standings at Aqueduct.</LD>
<LD>   A one-time assistant to Wayne Lukas, Pletcher can improve upon his
numbers today at Hollywood Park because he has leading contenders in
the $200,000 Miesque and the $200,000 Hollywood Turf Express. The
Miesque is the first leg of a pick six with a carry-over of $80,184.</LD>
<LD>   In the Miesque, the first race in Hollywood Park's three-day Turf
Festival with stakes races worth $2.1 million, Pletcher will send out
the unbeaten Ocean Drive, while Texas Glitter is his representative
in the Turf Express.</LD>
<TE>   A 2-year-old daughter of Belong To Me, Ocean Drive has won her
three starts on turf by a combined 10 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the third year in a row Texas Glitter has run in the
Turf Express. The 6-year-old Glitterman horse finished second by a
neck in 2000 and was fourth last year.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Lido Palace heads a field of 11 older horses in
the $400,000 Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs. Churchill Downs also
has a good-sized carry-over of $110,348.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Gamblin Town. The Town Caper filly won her third in a
row on Wednesday at Hollywood Park, overcoming a horrible start to
beat $10,000 California-breds.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Gary Contessa. The trainer won only three of his first
47 races at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Fly To The Wire, Brancusi
and Coax Kid in the seventh, singling Malabar Gold in the eighth and
Pennysenyen, Flylikethewind and Sonny Sal in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/39. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11.40/$215.60. Total money bet: $284.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Jackson Not Worried by Lackadaisical Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson said after Wednesday's loss in Orlando that too many
Lakers hadn't played hard.</LD>
<LD>   He said it the way he might have mentioned a turn in the weather,
a mild curiosity rather than a cause for alarm, almost not worth the
observation.</LD>
<LD>   Though it was the Lakers who were on their way to a 5-11 record,
having lost weakly the night before in Miami despite the rising
challenge to dismiss the season's first three weeks, the Magic was
quicker to the ball, quicker to the floor, more determined through
the screens.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not playing hard enough, actually," the coach had said to
no such probing question. Just, brought it up.</TE>
<TE>   And he wasn't mortified.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he said, "we're playing hard. We're not playing hard
enough.... We just can't throw the 75% game on the floor and expect
to win."</TE>
<TE>   As Kobe Bryant brushed up against the line between demanding more
of his teammates and casting blame in a postgame grope for answers,
other theories surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   The new players either aren't playing (Tracy Murray) or aren't
helping (Kareem Rush).</TE>
<TE>   The role players are hurt (Samaki Walker, Devean George, Mark
Madsen), making a historically thin bench utterly waifish, or missing
shots (Rick Fox, Robert Horry). Those who have shot well (Brian Shaw,
Derek Fisher) haven't shot enough.</TE>
<TE>   So, on a day spent at Shaquille O'Neal's dinner table, where they
could give thanks for Robert Horry's shot and Robert Mohr's scalpel,
the Lakers also had much to consider on their evening flight to
Memphis. They are 3-9 without O'Neal, 2-2 with him. They've lost
seven consecutive road games. Bryant routinely calls out his
teammates, the injured ones as well as the healthy ones.</TE>
<TE>   Asked on his way to the bus when all of this might get worrisome,
Fox leaned against a cinder-block wall and said, "Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see Shaq get 10 games under him," Fox said.
"Everything is, right now, being washed out ... so we can go forward
and be intact."</TE>
<TE>   This, Fox said, amounts to little more than the bully with his
back turned.</TE>
<TE>   "Blood in the water, man," he said, laughing. "Sharks are out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, to persistent questions about his size: "I'm 345 pounds,
16% body fat. Ask [strength coach Jim] Cotta."</TE>
<TE>   Cotta: "I don't know what his body fat is. What'd he say he
weighed?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 0-4 in the second of games on successive days, but
the cause isn't likely fatigue. They're 0-4 in the first, as well....
Fisher, in the four games since O'Neal's return: 54.2% field goals,
46.7% threes, 17.0 points per game. In the 12 games without O'Neal:
32.4% field goals, 24.3% threes, 7.9 points per game.... George
(ankle tendinitis) is eligible to come off the injured list for
Sunday's game against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Memphis Grizzlies, 5, Ch. 9 (delayed 6)</TE>
<TE>   Site -- The Pyramid</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC-AM (570), KWKW-AM (1330).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 5-11, Grizzlies 2-13.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Grizzlies (2001-02) -- 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Grizzlies have won two in a row since starting 0-13,
a winning streak that puts them 2 1/2 games behind the Lakers in the
Western Conference standings. You just knew Jerry West would have
them closing in on his former team in no time.... Hubie Brown is 2-5
since replacing Sidney Lowe as coach.</TE>

<HD>Inside Job Ends Maverick Streak</HD>
<DH>After winning 14 in a row to start season, Dallas can't
stop Pacers from attacking down low in 110-98 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Maverick owner Mark Cuban bit his lower lip as he walked off the
court, wearing a look of dejection and disappointment for the first
time since last spring.</LD>
<LD>   Unbeaten no more, Dallas was denied a spot in the NBA record book
Thursday night by an Indiana Pacer team that showed why it has the
best record in the East.</LD>
<LD>   Repeatedly working the ball inside to take advantage of its
low-post talent, Indiana got 26 points from Jermaine O'Neal and
inspired efforts from Al Harrington, Brad Miller and Ron Artest to
defeat the Mavericks, 110-98.</LD>
<TE>   The Pacers prevented Dallas (14-1) from matching the 1948-49
Washington Capitols and 1993-94 Houston Rockets for the best start to
a season in NBA history -- 15-0.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have made history tonight, and I don't think anybody
wanted history to be made against us," Artest said. "So that probably
gave us a little extra boost."</TE>
<TE>   Artest scored 20 points, including Indiana's first 10, while
Harrington scored 21 on nine-of-12 shooting and Miller had 16 on
seven-of-eight shooting.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal grabbed 18 rebounds and Artest had 10, helping the Pacers
to a 54-36 advantage on the boards as Indiana improved the East's
best record to 12-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers went straight to the basket right from the beginning,
with Artest scoring their first 10 points -- eight on layups, the
other two on free throws after he was fouled underneath.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas used an 11-2 run to erase an early 10-point deficit and
take a 24-23 lead, but the Mavericks weren't able to keep the
momentum. Reggie Miller made a three-point basket and then scored on
a layup off a steal by Artest to make it 47-39.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had to be tough inside to beat this team. We
controlled the game from start to finish," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   Artest made a three-pointer early in the third for a 68-55 lead,
and O'Neal closed the quarter with an alley-oop dunk off a pass from
Harrington for an 84-69 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a lot left in the tank, as you could tell,"
Maverick Coach Don Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Nash had a personal 7-0 run early in the fourth to pull
Dallas to 88-80, but Dallas then dropped into a tight 2-3 zone and
left Reggie Miller wide open at the three-point line for a 24-footer
that made it 91-80.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas got no closer than eight the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "There are only so many statement games in this league, and this
was one of them," Reggie Miller said. "When the rest of your peers
are watching, you want to play well."</TE>
<TE>   Nash led the Mavericks with 29 points, nine assists and seven
rebounds. Dirk Nowitzki shot only four for 20, Michael Finley was
seven for 20 and the Mavericks shot 38%, compared with Indiana's 54%.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks' unbeaten streak will go down as the second-longest
to start a season in league history, tied with the 1957-58 Boston
Celtics.</TE>

<LD>Motor racing is on vacation, with nothing on the schedule until
January except season-ending awards banquets, so let's take a look at
how 2002 shaped up.</LD>
<LD>   NASCAR, growing as fast as its glitzy promotional and public
relations can move it, had another gigantic year in terms of fan
attendance, TV ratings and controversy surrounding its champion, Tony
Stewart.</LD>
<LD>   According to NASCAR, the 36-race Winston Cup series has 75 million
adult fans, up 19% from 2001, and NASCAR fans represent 37% of the
U.S. population. It attracts the second largest crowd in motor
racing, 225,000 for the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, second only to
the open-wheel 500.</LD>
<TE>   Ratings indicate that the big logo-covered stock cars are watched
by more viewers than any other sport except pro football. NFL
football attracts 15.2 million on average for its Sunday games. Fox
averaged 9.4 million for Winston Cup races. This compares to 4.8
million for PGA golf tournaments and 3.4 million for a regular season
baseball game.</TE>
<TE>   "Television is the engine that drives the sport," says Paul
Brooks, the Los Angeles-based NASCAR vice president for broadcasting.
"Television is critical to our sponsors and to the whole exposure of
our sport. Last year, our sponsors got nearly $5 billion in total TV
exposure."</TE>
<TE>   That was more than a 125% increase over last year.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's championship drive was one of the strangest in the
sport's history. He started off last after being the first car out of
the Daytona 500 and finished the season under probation for punching
a photographer. Stewart's win was made possible when one after
another leader stumbled badly after getting the No. 1 position.</TE>
<TE>   Open-wheel racing, meaning CART and the IRL, can't really be
separated these days even though one is an international
multi-dimensional series and the other is a national oval-track
series.</TE>
<TE>   CART, despite efforts to keep it alive, seems to be in quicksand.
It has lost much more than it has gained and one of these days it may
disappear completely.</TE>
<TE>   The latest loss is its last European race, the Rockingham 500 in
England. Scrubbed for lack of interest, joining the German 500 that
folded a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving CART are its champion, driver of the year Cristiano da
Matta, and its most popular American driver, Michael Andretti; its
title sponsor, FedEx, as well as big bucks team sponsors Target, Kool
and Motorola; and major team owners Chip Ganassi and Barry Green.</TE>
<TE>   The car count slid to an embarrassing 18 last year and it may be
difficult to reach even that number by the opening race in February.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the admitted loss of more than $12 million from
production of six races on CBS and the future isn't pretty.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, there is the IRL, looking more like the CART of
a few years ago than anything else. The shift of teams such as
Penske, Ganassi and Green/Andretti along with their drivers will beef
up the starting grid, but also is likely to squeeze out the "little
guys" who saved the day for Tony George in the scary start-up days of
the IRL a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   One of George's talking points was making a place for young
American drivers. Last year, Brazilians Gil de Ferran and Helio
Castroneves moved in, and next year Andretti is bringing a Scotsman,
Dario Franchitti, a Brazilian, Tony Kanaan, and an Englishman, Dan
Wheeldon. Kenny Brack, a Swede who was once in the IRL, is reportedly
moving back.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Hornish Jr. successfully defended his IRL championship after a
tense battle with de Ferran and Castroneves, winning by a narrow
margin in the last race at Texas. Already, NASCAR teams are said to
be wooing the young Ohio driver.</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry about George's seven-year-old project, however. As
long as it has the Indianapolis 500, it will always be the top banana
in open-wheel racing.</TE>
<TE>   Drag racing had another successful season, even though three of
its four major titles were determined before the season finale at
Pomona, and even the fourth was somewhat uneventful as it matched
teammates John Force and Tony Pedregon. Force's win solidified his
stature as the sport's most dominating figure -- 10 consecutive funny
car championships and 11 out of the last 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Bernstein's retirement year added interest in the run of
second-generation top fuel driver Larry Dixon to the title in one of
Don Prudhomme's dragsters.</TE>
<TE>   Only five weeks to the first supercross of the season Jan. 4 at
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Raceway</TE>
<TE>   Racing fans throughout the West are applauding the fact that
Ventura Raceway was granted a year's extension in its contract with
the Ventura County Fair Board. It will be the 25th year for promoter
Jim Naylor at the picturesque Seaside Park facility.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it's not 25 and out," Naylor said. "We have some new ideas
for next year that we think will help us stick around for a few more
seasons."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jim Williams, president and chief executive officer of
Irwindale Speedway: "This is really great news for the sport.
Elimination of any race track anywhere is never a good thing. Ventura
Raceway's fans are an important component in maintaining a strong fan
base for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   The 10th Walt James Vintage Race Car gathering is this weekend at
the Walt James Stadium's three-eighths-mile dirt oval on Willow
Springs Motorsports Park. Eligible are any pre-1980s sprint car,
midget, stock car or roadster.</TE>
<TE>   Street legal racers will have several opportunities to display
their horsepower in the next two weeks. Next Thursday, Irwindale
Speedway will hold its popular Under-the-Lights test and tune session
on the eighth-mile strip. California Dragway will open its
quarter-mile lanes Dec. 14-15 for a final weekend of running on the
speedway's main parking lot in Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   Rip Michels was one of six Irwindale Speedway champions honored at
Saturday's awards banquet. Michels, the 2000 Grand American modified
champion, took home a $5,000 bonus for winning the super late model
title.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners were Todd Burns, late model; Terry Limberopoulos,
modified 4s; James Altman, Figure 8; Carson Woods, super truck; and
Michael May, 19, pro trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran drag racer John Lingenfelter, who suffered head injuries
in a crash Oct. 27 at Pomona Raceway, has recovered sufficiently at
Pomona Valley Hospital to be flown home to Indiana where he will
continue his rehabilitation in an Indianapolis hospital. He was
driving in the Mazda NHRA Sport Compact World Series.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Says He'll Retire After End of the Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan said Thursday he will retire for the third and last
time after this season and resume his role as partial owner of the
Washington Wizards.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan told reporters after practice that there is "zero chance"
of him coming back again, The Washington Post and the Carroll County
(Md.) Times reported.</LD>
<LD>   "I tell you right now that I'm just fulfilling my contract," said
Jordan, who signed a two-year, $2.1 million deal with Washington last
year after stepping down from his executive duties. "At the end of
this season, I'm not looking at another contract. I just want to
finish this year out and hopefully fulfill my obligations and let
this team take its own course."</LD>
<TE>   Jordan, who will turn 40 in February, returned to basketball last
season because he said he still felt the need to compete.</TE>
<TE>   After joining the Wizards as a player, Jordan energized Washington
for most of last season before he was forced out of the lineup with a
bad right knee that eventually required surgery.</TE>

<HD>Conner's America's Cup Bid Ends, For Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dennis Conner's ninth America's Cup campaign ended when his New
York-based team, Stars &amp; Stripes, was eliminated from the 31st Cup
regatta by OneWorld of Seattle today at Auckland, New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   OneWorld beat Team Dennis Conner by one minute to complete a 4-0
sweep of their best-of-seven quarterfinal; OneWorld advanced to the
semifinals, which begin Dec. 9.</LD>
<LD>   Prada of Italy -- the challenger champion off Auckland two years
ago -- advanced to its second Louis Vuitton Cup semifinal when it
beat Sweden's Victory Challenge by 1:37, also completing a 4-0 series
victory.</LD>
<TE>   The success of the Seattle and Italian teams means the most
powerful challenger teams, those with billionaire backers, will now
line up in the four-team semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld, supported by Seattle cell-phone pioneer Craig McCaw and
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Prada, backed by the Milan
fashion house of the same name, join Alinghi of Switzerland and
Oracle of San Francisco in the final four.</TE>
<TE>   Conner has won the Cup four times since 1974, and the New York
Yacht Club held the trophy for 132 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the semifinals, Oracle will race Alinghi and OneWorld will take
on Prada, but there are legal issues to settle before that is
confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Stars &amp; Stripes and Prada are partners in a legal action that
seeks to have OneWorld thrown out of the competition for acquiring
secret design information belonging to other teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Cup's arbitration panel will meet Dec. 7 and 8 to consider
that case.</TE>
<TE>   If the panel or jury rule against OneWorld, Conner's team could be
called back into action. Because of that reason, his team won't leave
Auckland anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden placed its last, faint hope for Friday's challenger regatta
in the hands of Magnus Holmberg, giving him the helm of its race
yacht Orm in place of double Olympic gold medalist Jesper Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Stars &amp; Stripes fought doggedly to keep alive its campaign,
trailing OneWorld by no more than 21 seconds over the first five
legs.</TE>
<TE>   Stars &amp; Stripes also sailed into trouble at the last mark
rounding, when it briefly lost control of its spinnaker.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   Retief Goosen and Chris DiMarco shot four-under-par 68s to share
the first-round lead at the $4.06-million Nedbank Golf Challenge at
Sun City, South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Furyk was at 69, with three players at 70: defending champion
Sergio Garcia, Robert Allenby and Ernie Els. The winner of the elite
12-player tournament earns $2 million, the richest prize in golf.</TE>
<TE>   The greens were hard and fast at Gary Player Country Club because
of little rain this month in this part of South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Price and Michael Campbell shot 71s, Darren Clarke and
Padraig Harrington were at 72, with Bob Estes at 73 and Colin
Montgomerie at 74.</TE>
<TE>   Furyk, who was disqualified in last year's first round for a
violation he called on himself, played before enthusiastic galleries.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people told me they were glad to have me here, and it
sure was nice to have the support of people in Ernie Els' back yard,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Winter Sports</TE>
<TE>   Primoz Peterka of Slovenia topped qualifying in the first World
Cup ski jumping meet of the season at Kuusamo, Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Jumping under the lights in this Finnish city just south of the
Arctic Circle, Peterka recorded a leap of 461 feet on the K120 hill.
Austria's Andreas Widholzl was second at 457 1/2 feet (139.5 meters),
and Peterka's teammate Robert Kranjec was third.</TE>
<TE>   The season opener is scheduled for today, weather permitting.</TE>
<TE>   Cold weather threatened today's second leg of the Nordic combined
World Cup opener, a 15-kilometer cross-country race. Under race
rules, the limit is minus-four degrees Fahrenheit.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday evening, the temperature was zero degrees.</TE>

<HD>White Takes Fast Ride to the Top</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Shaun White first started snowboarding, he could zip down the
halfpipe easily enough, but he was too young and much too small to
keep lugging his board back to the top.</LD>
<LD>   He looked around at all the big people and, like that, his problem
was solved.</LD>
<LD>   "I established this new thing where I'd get to the bottom and just
jump on random backs and get a free ride back up," he says with a
laugh. "It was great."</LD>
<TE>   Ten years later, White, at 16, is 5 feet 6 and nearly 130 pounds.
With his spindly legs finally developing into those of a man, he is
already proven but still showing more promise than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaun White is just a freak of nature," says Dave Downing, 34,
like White a pro rider for Burton Snowboards. "On two feet, he's just
a goofy kid, but on a snowboard, or even a skateboard, he's
absolutely amazing."</TE>
<TE>   What's amazing is that White, a freckle-faced redhead who probably
never will be taken on first glance as an athlete, already has become
one of the world's top freestyle riders.</TE>
<TE>   During the Winter X Games last January at Vail, Colo., he won
silver medals in the superpipe and slopestyle events. At the World
Snowboarding Championships a month later at Vail, he won the
slopestyle competition and finished second in the superpipe.</TE>
<TE>   He did not make the U.S. Olympic team but there are some who
believe he should have, and White is among more than a few
snowboarders puzzled by the judging during the qualifiers and Olympic
events, both run by the International Ski Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "It really disappointed me, not making it," he says, sheepishly.
"I was spending all that time at those contests, which were really
bad contests, and not coming out in the end. It was really weird.
Nobody really understood what was going on [with the judges]."</TE>
<TE>   As if to prove a point, after the Olympic team was announced,
White traveled to the X Games and outperformed all but J.J. Thomas of
the U.S. team. Thomas won the gold at the X Games superpipe
competition and went on to win the bronze at the Olympic halfpipe
event.</TE>
<TE>   When the next Winter Olympics roll around -- at Turin, Italy, in
2006 -- White will be 19 and fully developed physically, more than
likely the strong favorite to win the halfpipe event.</TE>
<TE>   That is, if he decides to try to make the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to see," he says. "Maybe it'll just kind of happen
where I'll say, 'I'm going to go for it,' and then really go for it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While others his age have been to, say, Disneyland, White has
trouble keeping track of his travels.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been to Japan, Costa Rica, Argentina, Chile, Norway,
Australia ... did I say Japan?" he says, pausing to think during a
breakfast interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, and I've been all over Europe ... to Switzerland, Italy,
Germany, Austria, France. I've got a big passport full of stamps."</TE>
<TE>   He has a favorite noodle house in Tokyo, "where they all know me
and they always go like this when I walk in," he says, patting a
rust-colored mop that doubles as hair. "In Japan, everyone is so
nice. You always know you're going to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   He has a favorite beach in Costa Rica, although he can't remember
its name or location.</TE>
<TE>   "But I was just amazed by it," he says. "There were these huge
iguanas walking down the street, just hanging out. I'm like, 'This is
crazy. What is going on?' "</TE>
<TE>   He has disdain for the French, same as many American travelers
seem to have.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't even look at you if you stop to ask them for
directions," he explains, poking his fork into a vegetable omelet.
"From what I've seen, they're just not very friendly people."</TE>
<TE>   But while White has seen more than the average 10th-grader, there
is some concern, by his parents, anyway, that he's missing out on
things other kids enjoy while growing up.</TE>
<TE>   He is enrolled in an independent study program and attends regular
classes only when he's home. He has not been to school dances or any
school functions. He does not have a girlfriend -- "but he's
looking," says Cathy, his mom -- nor does he have much in common with
any of his male classmates.</TE>
<TE>   He may be having the time of his life, but in his answer there is
a hint of uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I feel about it is that I could be at school, doing the
whole school deal, but I'm having so much more fun going on the
road," he says, glancing at his team manager as if seeking approval.
"What am I missing? Am I better off hanging out at school with kids
that aren't interested in what I'm interested in, who don't really
skate and don't really surf and stuff like that?</TE>
<TE>   "Or am I better off being able to live like [skateboarding legend]
Tony Hawk, hanging out with him and skating at the park or whatever,
or going to Japan with [other pro riders] and snowboarding and stuff
like that?</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many more experiences to be gained by going on the
road and around the world. I don't think I'm really missing out on
too much. The only thing I missed so far was sixth-grade camp. I was
disappointed at first and then my friends said it wasn't that great."</TE>
<TE>   His manager, Sean Lake, nods his approval and chimes in, "I did go
to sixth-grade camp and it wasn't that great."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding's youngest superstar may not be the most popular
athlete at Carlsbad High. In fact, because he's away so much, he's
hardly recognized for what he is and does not attract much attention.</TE>
<TE>   But White is, in all likelihood, the most successful current
athlete on campus -- at least financially. He has earned gobs of
money in contests and through sponsorships. He recently bought an
ocean-front home just up the road from his favorite surf break. In
his driveway is a truck he won by finishing as the overall champion
of the Vans Triple Crown of Snowboarding in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem is, he can't drive by himself because he does not
have a driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   "I was late getting my [learner's] permit so I won't get my
license till I turn 17," he explains. "And I can't drive with my mom
because she freaks out and grabs the wheel and stuff. It's scary."</TE>
<TE>   Cathy White laughs. What's scary, she says, is that her son has a
lead foot.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't not speed," she said. "If he stops at one stop sign,
he's already looking ahead to the next one."</TE>
<TE>   Cathy keeps a close eye on her youngest child -- White's brother
Jesse, 22, and sister Kari, 17, are both standout snowboarders too,
but never took the sport as seriously as Shaun.</TE>
<TE>   The entire family has been supportive but Cathy has made the
biggest commitment. She quit her job as a waitress so she could
accompany her son during his travels, to events and other functions
his career demands.</TE>
<TE>   She makes sure Shaun keeps up with his schoolwork, driving him to
libraries and hiring tutors. She tries to protect him from the undue
influence of older riders, although she says they're generally a good
bunch.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly, I'm there because he's still young and needs some family
support," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun's dad, Roger, got the family into snowboarding and was one
of those on whose back Shaun would climb on when he was small. Roger
works for the city of San Diego and he and Cathy agreed that it made
more sense for her to quit her job and accompany Shaun than for him
to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun is "on the right track" to graduate from high school with
others his age, Cathy says, thanks largely to an accommodating school
district. White has earned art credit for his snowboard designs; he
has earned economics credit for his handling of details associated
with the purchase of his house, and he has earned math credit for the
planning of his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all real-life lessons a normal kid does on paper --
lessons about budgets and mortgages, things like that," Cathy White
says. "Shaun is just learning them in the real world, and he's
sometimes learning the hard way. I mean, he insisted on putting
bamboo floors in his house because they looked cool, and now he's
finding out what a bad idea that was because they're always cold and
damp."</TE>
<TE>   Another lesson has to do with drugs and alcohol. So far, White
seems to have earned a passing grade.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he bides his time during his travels, while many of the
other pros are off partying, White offers an answer any 16-year-old
can appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on where I am," he says. "Like, if it's [at a trade
show] in Vegas -- and there's nothing for me in Vegas -- the only
thing I do is, like, go with a giant sack of change to the [video]
arcade and just kill it -- just destroy the place."</TE>

<LD>Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, the FIFA president who is on a swing through
several Central and North American countries, said in El Salvador
that the 2006 World Cup will be officiated by three-man teams that
will remain together throughout the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "We will have very consistent refereeing for the 2006 World Cup,"
soccer's highest-ranked official said in San Salvador. "We are going
to designate trios of match officials to always work together ...
like a football team. We won't be able to change them."</LD>
<LD>   In the past, referees and their assistants have been interchanged
from game to game, leading to inconsistency and errors.</LD>
<TE>   Acting in the wake of a series of incorrect calls at the 2002
World Cup, FIFA's refereeing committee recommended last month that
each official in the trios be of the same nationality, but that idea
proved controversial and Blatter did not mention whether it would be
implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's Solution</TE>
<TE>   The Ecuador Football Federation has bowed to pressure from five of
the six clubs still involved in the league championship race and has
agreed to employ foreign referees for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The federation has called in a dozen referees and linesmen from
Argentina and Uruguay for the last five rounds of the tournament at a
cost of $80,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's league has been plagued by controversial refereeing
decisions, most notably those made by World Cup referee Byron Moreno,
who was subsequently suspended for 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari Confirmed</TE>
<TE>   The Portuguese Football Federation on Thursday confirmed that 2002
World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari of Brazil will become
Portugal's national team coach.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the contract were not revealed, but the federation said
Scolari would "assume the technical and organizational command of the
first team from January 2003 to July 2004."</TE>
<TE>   According to Portuguese media reports, Scolari, 54, will earn an
estimated $150,000 per month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's excellent, marvelous, I'm very happy," Scolari told Reuters
in Rio de Janeiro. "The intention is to win the European Championship
[which Portugal hosts in 2004].</TE>
<TE>   "After winning the Gulf Cup [as coach of Kuwait in 1990], the Copa
Libertadores [as coach of Gremio in 1995 and Palmeiras in 1999] and
the World Cup, I think the European Championship is the one that's
missing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the things that made me interested in the offer."</TE>
<TE>   Bolivian Title</TE>
<TE>   A hat trick by Joaquin Botero helped Bolivar clinch the Bolivian
league championship with a 7-1 victory over Wilstermann in the
next-to-last game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Botero leads the league in scoring with 47 goals, one more than
Oriente Petrolero's 19-year-old striker Jose Castillo.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders Retire</TE>
<TE>   Two German Bundesliga defenders, Raymond Kalla of Cameroon and
Tomasz Hajto of Poland, announced their retirement from international
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Kalla, who plays for VfL Bochum, told the German magazine
FussballStars that he was quitting because of Cameroon's
disappointing first-round exit from Korea/Japan '02 under Coach
Winfried Schaefer.</TE>
<TE>   "Schaefer knows exactly what happened," Kalla said, without
amplifying. "We had a team who could have reached the semifinals or
the final. Maybe we could have even won the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Hajto, of Schalke 04, played 47 games for Poland but said he does
not see eye to eye with Coach Zbigniew Boniek, who took charge of the
national team after it too, was eliminated in the first round of the
World Cup.</TE>

<HD>Golden Apples Is Ripe for Victory</HD>
<DH>Filly could lock up an Eclipse award with a victory in the
$500,000 Matriarch on Sunday at Hollywood Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golden Apples might have been fourth in the Breeders' Cup Filly &amp;
Mare Turf last month, but she's still the favorite to win an Eclipse
award and could erase all doubt Sunday with a win in the $500,000
Matriarch at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   The Matriarch comes on the windup day of Hollywood's Turf
Festival, a $2.1-million stakes weekend that starts today with the
Miesque and the Hollywood Turf Express, a pair of $200,000 races.
Good Journey, third in the Breeders' Cup Mile, will try to repeat in
the $500,000 Citation Handicap, which heads a Saturday card that
includes the $200,000 Generous for 2-year-olds. Besides the
Matriarch, Sunday's card includes the $500,000 Hollywood Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Although Starine was an upset winner in the Breeders' Cup Filly &amp;
Mare Turf, that has been her only win of the year and since then the
French-bred 5-year-old has been sold by owner-trainer Bobby Frankel
for $1 million as a broodmare prospect.</LD>
<TE>   Golden Apples couldn't beat Starine in last year's Matriarch,
running third, but this year, before the Breeders' Cup, trainer Ben
Cecil's filly put together five solid races. She has had three wins
and two seconds, including Grade I victories in the Beverly D. at
Arlington Park and the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Valenzuela, who returned Wednesday at Hollywood Park after not
riding the first 15 days of the meet due to accumulated suspensions,
rode Golden Apples in both of her Grade I wins and will be aboard
again in the Matriarch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad trip from the start," Valenzuela said of Golden
Apples' Breeders' Cup. "I got hammered leaving the gate and we just
about clipped heels. I had to grab my filly. That left me where I
didn't want to be, and then she had too much ground to make up after
being shuffled back that far."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's six rivals for Golden Apples include Banks Hill, who was
second in the Breeders' Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf -- the race she had won
in 2001. Others running are Affluent, who has beaten Golden Apples
twice; European invaders Choc Ice and Dress To Thrill, who was eighth
in the Breeders' Cup Mile; Magic Mission and Tates Creek, who is
Banks Hill's stablemate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Favored Lido Palace drew the inside post in a field of 12 for
today's $400,000 Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs.... Valenzuela,
who hasn't ridden in New York since 1994, will be aboard Crafty C.T.
in the $350,000 Cigar Mile at Aqueduct on Saturday. The 10-horse
field also includes Aldebaran, Congaree, Red Bullet, Harlan's Holiday
and Bonapaw.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turf Festival</TE>
<TE>   What: Turf stakes races worth $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Where: Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   When: Today through Sunday. First post is 12:30 p.m. each day.</TE>
<TE>   The races: Today, $200,000 Miesque and $200,000 Hollywood Turf
Express; Saturday, $500,000 Citation and $200,000 Generous; Sunday,
$500,000 Matriarch and $500,000 Hollywood Derby.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Shaken Up in Irwindale Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Solorzano</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Stewart, NASCAR's Winston Cup champion, was shaken up after
being involved in a crash during the 100-lap Western States Midget
feature on Thursday night at Irwindale Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart, who earlier won the United States Auto Club's 40-lap
Western Sprint Car event in the 62nd Turkey Night Grand Prix before
6,500 at Irwindale Speedway, did not require hospitalization.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Lewis held off Kasey Kahne to win the midget feature.</LD>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure about our chances before the race, but we hit it
right on tonight," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   Kahne, who completed his rookie year in the NASCAR Busch Grand
National series, was battling Lewis for the lead while Stewart
attempted to catch the leaders from third place.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart began to make a move when the leaders entered lap traffic.
On Lap 46, Stewart and Aaron Fike collided, ending both drivers'
nights.</TE>
<TE>   The throttle on Fike's car appeared to get stuck, and he ran into
Stewart as both entered the third turn.</TE>
<TE>   After the restart, Lewis and Kahne pulled away again.</TE>
<TE>   With both drivers running on Beast chassis on Ed Pink Ford
engines, it was only a question of Kahne getting an opportunity to
challenge Lewis for the lead, but Lewis held him off at the end,
winning by 0.101 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   In the Western Sprints feature, Stewart took the lead on Lap 3 and
cruised to victory over Eric Butze and Scott Hansen.</TE>
<TE>   After taking the lead, Stewart jumped to as much as a four-second
lead over his challengers.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, always one who speaks his mind, took a dig at the
burgeoning NASCAR fan base by praising the Irwindale fans for not
being "wannabes like some fans, who want to be real racing fans like
you."</TE>

<LD>While a nation feasted Thursday, a much-maligned Bruin squad ducked
out under cover of holiday.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA will surface today in Indianapolis, practicing in Conseco
Fieldhouse in preparation for the Wooden Tradition, a doubleheader
Saturday that begins with the No. 14 Bruins (0-1) facing No. 6 Duke
(2-0) at 10 a.m. Purdue (1-0) will play Louisville (1-0) in the
second game.</LD>
<LD>   John Wooden, the event's namesake and legendary former UCLA coach,
will attend, flying by private jet from Los Angeles today. Wooden
watched most of the Bruins' opener, an 86-81 overtime loss to San
Diego, leaving with about five minutes left in regulation and the
score tied.</LD>
<TE>   Wooden and coaches of the four teams will conduct a news
conference today, meaning that UCLA Coach Steve Lavin will sit
alongside men who have have figured prominently in his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin was a graduate assistant from 1988 to '91 under Purdue Coach
Gene Keady. Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski is described in the UCLA media
guide as Lavin's "friend and mentor," and is the only coach besides
Lavin to lead his team to five Sweet 16s in the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin's association with Louisville Coach Rick Pitino is less
favorable. Two years ago, then-UCLA athletic director Pete Dalis
openly courted Pitino, but UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale
intervened and Lavin survived.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his first game since the 2000-01 season, Bruin senior guard Ray
Young displayed a good shooting touch and solid defense.</TE>
<TE>   Young made four of seven shots against San Diego, including one of
three from three-point range. He played 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He made one glaring mistake, launching an errant three-point
attempt early in a possession with UCLA holding a 65-58 lead with
seven minutes left.</TE>

<HD>Center Katnik Says He's Ready to Play</HD>

<LD>USC center Norm Katnik on Thursday pronounced himself fit to play
against seventh-ranked Notre Dame after participating in contact
drills for the first time this week.</LD>
<LD>   Katnik, a junior who has started every game this season, suffered
a high ankle sprain during the fourth quarter against UCLA on
Saturday. He did not practice Monday and only performed agility
drills Tuesday and Wednesday while senior Derek Graf worked with the
first-team offense.</LD>
<LD>   Katnik alternated with Graf on Thursday during a one-hour workout.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a little hurt in there, but with two days to go before
game time, I'll get a couple more treatments in and I should be
feeling good," Katnik said. "I never really lost much flexibility. It
just felt a little weak when I pushed off on it."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said the starter would not be determined
until game time.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get through warmups and see how it works out," Carroll
said. "Derek had a real good week so we feel comfortable with him
playing. If between the two of them we can roll through, we'll be
fine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver D. Hale is eager to catch a pass after making a key
block that helped flanker Keary Colbert score on a 34-yard reverse
against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Hale was sidelined for most of the season after breaking a bone in
his left ankle during training camp. He played for the first time
Nov. 9 against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to work myself back in wherever they allow me to,"
said Hale, a former walk-on who earned a scholarship last spring.
"There is always a play to be made whether it's blocking, catching a
pass or returning a kick.</TE>
<TE>   "It just felt good to contribute."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Practice was closed, but the sideline at Howard Jones Field was
filled with more family members than usual because of the
Thanksgiving holiday and Notre Dame game.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman wide receiver Mike Williams, from Tampa, Fla., and
freshman tight end Dominique Byrd, from Minneapolis, were among the
out-of-state players with relatives in town.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice because I haven't seen my Mom since our first game
against Auburn," Byrd said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he was pleased with the Trojans' concentration this
week. The team will have a walk-through today. "We really put
together the week we needed. Now it's go clean up a couple things and
go play," Carroll said.... Freshman offensive lineman Fred Matua was
not at practice because of an illness in his family.... Notre Dame
arrived in Los Angeles on Thursday night.</TE>

<LD>   USC (3-1) vs No. 10 Notre Dame (1-0) at Sports Arena, 7, KMPC
(1540) -- The Trojans get another shot at a Top 10 team, but will
need to cut down their turnover average (20.8) and lift their field
goal shooting (36.4%) for an upset. The Fighting Irish, led by
sophomore forward Katy Flecky's career-best 22 points, easily
dispatched Cleveland State, 107-65, in their season opener Tuesday.</LD>
