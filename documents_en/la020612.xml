<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone can make sensational chocolate desserts, as long as you
remember to handle chocolate with care. Moisture and heat are
chocolate's worst enemies.</LD>
<LD>   Gentle heat is essential when you're melting chocolate--if
overheated it may take on a burnt taste or a gritty texture. Set the
bowl of chocolate above a pan of hot, not-quite-simmering water and
stir it often. Because milk and white chocolates are even more
sensitive to heat than dark chocolate, I melt them only partially
above the hot water; they finish melting off the heat. You can also
melt chocolate on medium power in the microwave, but check it
frequently. Microwaved chocolate cubes don't appear melted to the
eye, but as soon as you stir them, they liquefy.</LD>
<LD>   Do not cover the chocolate. Steam condensing on the lid may drip
into the chocolate and make the pieces stick together and seize, or
harden. Seizing can also occur if you splash water into the chocolate
or if you melt it with a tiny amount of liquid. To add flavorings,
melt every 2 ounces of chocolate with at least 1 tablespoon of
coffee, juice, liqueur, cream or milk, or with 1/4 cup of butter.</LD>
<TE>   You can rescue seized chocolate by adding liquid by tablespoons or
mild-flavored oil by teaspoons. This is likely to work but may throw
off your recipe. Adding enough liquid to make sauce will salvage your
chocolate, but for the dessert you're preparing you'll need a new
batch.</TE>
<TE>   Bittersweet and semisweet chocolates are usually interchangeable.
You can use bars of fine dark eating chocolate, not just the kind in
the market's baking aisle. Do not substitute unsweetened chocolate.</TE>

<TE>   Chocolate Mousse Three Ways</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours
chilling</TE>
<TE>   To turn this dark chocolate mousse into milk or white chocolate
mousse, follow the variations below. Milk and white chocolate set
less firmly than dark chocolate when chilled, so I add more butter.
You can make the mousses up to 2 days ahead. For special occasions I
layer all three mousses in a wine glass, beginning with the white
mousse (the thinnest), followed by the milk chocolate, then the dark.
I chill each layer about 1 1/2 hours and only then I prepare and add
the next mousse.</TE>
<TE>   12 ounces fine-quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cut in
tablespoon-size pieces</TE>
<TE>   6 eggs, separated, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   Choose a bowl that can sit snugly above a saucepan. Add enough
water to the saucepan so it doesn't touch the bowl and heat it to
nearly simmering. Combine the chocolate and the cream in the bowl.
Set the bowl above the saucepan over low heat. Leave the chocolate
just until melted, stirring occasionally with a dry wooden spoon.
Remove the bowl; stir the chocolate until smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Whisk in the butter. Add the egg yolks, one by one, whisking
vigorously after each addition.</TE>
<TE>   In a dry bowl, whip the egg whites with dry beaters at medium
speed until soft peaks form. Beat in the sugar and whip at high speed
until the whites are just stiff and shiny but not dry.</TE>
<TE>   Quickly fold about a fourth of the whites into the chocolate
mixture. Spoon this mixture over the remaining whites and fold them
gently until blended in.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the mixture among 6 small wine glasses, ramekins or small
deep dessert dishes. Refrigerate the mousses for 2 hours or until
they set. Serve cold.</TE>
<TE>   6 servings. Each serving: 454 calories; 74 mg sodium; 243 mg
cholesterol; 33 grams fat; 19 grams saturated fat; 39 grams
carbohydrates; 9 grams protein; 3.34 grams fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Milk Chocolate Mousse: Melt 12 ounces milk chocolate with the
cream as above, leaving it above the hot water only until partially
melted. Off the heat, whisk it until smooth. Whisk in 6 tablespoons
butter. When beating the egg whites, add only 2 teaspoons sugar.
Refrigerate until set before serving.</TE>
<TE>   White Chocolate Mousse: Melt 12 ounces white chocolate with the
cream as above, leaving it above the hot water only until partially
melted. Off the heat, whisk it until smooth. Whisk in 9 tablespoons
(1 stick plus 1 tablespoon) butter. When beating the egg whites, add
only 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar. Refrigerate until set before serving.</TE>
<TE>   Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of
food-borne illness and recommends that infants, the elderly and
immuno-compromised people avoid raw eggs.</TE>

<HD>Fruit, Sugar and a Little Bit of Time</HD>
<DH>The rap on making jam is it takes long hours over a steamy
vat. Some modern cooks know a better way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Nobody makes jam at home anymore except for shut-ins and little old
ladies," a long-ago editor once told me. I was thinking about that
Sunday as I whipped up a mess of strawberry preserves after
breakfast, in between going to the farmers market and getting ready
to watch the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, home preserving has an image about as hip and sexy as a
gingham apron. But hip and sexy is a passing pleasure, especially
when compared with the flavor of a spoonful of my strawberry
preserves smeared on a piece of hot buttered toast in the morning.
And don't even get me started on my elephant heart plum or
nectarine-and-rose geranium jams.</LD>
<LD>   It is surprising that in this do-it-yourself world of cooking,
where people brag about making their own bread, fresh pasta and
chicken stock, that jam making is still so little regarded. That's
especially true considering this technique--it makes creating your
own jams and preserves about as complicated as cooking a quick pasta
for dinner.</LD>
<TE>   Here's what you'll need: a big pot, a nonstick skillet and a
scale. Oh, and fruit. But just a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with most preserving is that it requires such large
quantities. This does have the advantage of making enough jelly to
hold you through a hard Midwestern winter. However, that is
outweighed by the finger cramps you get when paring a bushel of
fruit, the amount of time required to cook all of it, and the sheer
uncertainty involved when preparing jams in such large batches (Is it
done now? Now? Now?).</TE>
<TE>   But when you make jam in small amounts like this, you can do it
almost spontaneously. A couple of pints of strawberries will turn
into four or five jars of jam in less than 20 minutes of cooking
time. There's an overnight sit involved beforehand--to let the sugar
pull all that sweet juice out of the fruit--but how much trouble is
that?</TE>
<TE>   I first tried this a couple of years ago after a suggestion by a
friend, cookbook author Sylvia Thompson. First one batch, then
another. Just about every time I went to the market, I'd come back
with a couple of pounds of something to turn into jam.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it goes (this basic technique will work with everything
from strawberries and mulberries to peaches and plums): Wash the
fruit and cut it up in bite-size pieces. Weigh it and put it in a pot
with an equal weight of sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Bring this to a boil and stir until the juices are clear, then set
it aside for several hours or overnight. Ladle a couple of cups'
worth of fruit into a skillet and bring it to a boil again. Cook
until the mixture has set--this will take five minutes or less--and
you're done.</TE>
<TE>   If you've been troubled in the past by difficulty in telling when
jam has jelled, this method is much easier. When you're working with
only two cups of fruit, you can tell by the feel when the mixture has
set. Suddenly, it's thicker and smoother when you're stirring.</TE>
<TE>   As a long-time preserver, I am still startled that it cooks so
quickly. In fact, the first batch usually winds up slightly
overcooked. ("Let's go a little longer, it can't be done already!"
But it is.)</TE>
<TE>   To make certain the mixture is cooked, lift your spatula: When the
mixture no longer flows from the side at one point, the way liquids
do, but begins to come off in multiple points or sheets, it's done.</TE>
<TE>   Or use the plate test: Chill a plate in the freezer for 10
minutes, and when you think the jam is ready, spoon a drop of liquid
onto the plate. If it doesn't run, you're done.</TE>
<TE>   You'll notice that the texture of this jam is a little different
than what you may be used to. It'll be softer, spoonable. That's
because it's made without artificial pectin and with less sugar.
Adding pectin makes jam-making easy, but it also results in a very
firm set. It also requires a certain percentage of sugar to work
right--more than I like to use.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, according to the Food and Drug Administration, you can't
really call this a jam. The FDA regulations on product identity
require a jam, jelly or preserve to contain at least 65% sugar. This
jam is only 50% and can be made with even less. That leaves it with a
much fresher taste and a brighter color.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to can the jams so you can store them without
refrigeration, you'll need another 15 minutes of work. Despite the
mystique surrounding it, canning isn't hard. The main thing is making
sure everything you use is sterilized--easy enough to do when one of
the requirements is a big pot of boiling water.</TE>
<TE>   Boil the jars and lids for five minutes and you're ready to go.
Ladle the jam mixture into the jars (a wide-mouth canning funnel
isn't necessary but will certainly make cleanup a lot easier). Put
the lids on top and tighten down the bands. Now put the jars in the
boiling water, making sure they're completely submerged. (If you have
a pasta insert, the deep basket that comes with a pasta pot, you can
add the jars and remove them much more easily.) Cook 10 minutes and
then lift the jars from the bath. That's about it.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of hours, check to make sure you've got good seals
(the merry pinging you should hear during the cool-down will be the
lids popping from the vacuum forming). Press down firmly in the
center of each lid; there shouldn't be any flex. If the lid flexes,
repeat the canning process.</TE>
<TE>   But canning is really not necessary when you're making this little
jam at a time. You can easily store the four or five jars in the
refrigerator. They'll last a couple of weeks and then you'll be ready
to make some more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry Preserves</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes plus 8 hours
standing</TE>
<TE>   This recipe works best with weights (how would you know if you
were a few strawberries short of a pint?). Use equal amounts of fruit
and sugar. We've listed approximate volume measures if you don't have
a scale (2 pints of strawberries weigh about 2 pounds.)</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds washed and hulled strawberries, cut into bite-size pieces
(about 8 cups)</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds sugar (about 4 cups)</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   Combine the strawberries and sugar in a large pot and heat slowly
until the juices are clear, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and
stir in the lemon juice, then cover loosely and let stand overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, get everything ready for canning: Bring a large pot
of water to a boil and sterilize 5 sets of jars and lids, about 5
minutes. Turn off the heat, but leave the jars and lids in the hot
water until you're ready to use them.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 2 cups of the strawberries and juice in a 10-inch nonstick
skillet over medium-high heat. When the strawberries start to simmer,
cook, stirring often, until the preserves test done, 3 to 5 minutes.
Ladle the jam into the sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of
the rim. Cover with the lid and fasten the ring tight.</TE>
<TE>   Set aside and repeat with the remaining strawberries and juice.</TE>
<TE>   To complete the seal, bring the large pot of water back to a boil,
place the covered jars in a pasta insert and place them in the pot.
Make sure the boiling water covers the jars. Cook 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the jars from the pan and set aside to cool. After 30
minutes, check the lids to make sure they've sealed tightly. Gently
press down in the center of the lid; if it does not spring back, you
have a tight seal.</TE>
<TE>   Repeat the canning process with any jars that have not sealed
tightly.</TE>

<LD>Combine tart, fresh lemons with the ripest, juiciest watermelon you
can find for this refreshing hot-weather drink. It's a good
alternative to popular high-calorie coffee drinks, shakes or floats.</LD>
<LD>   Depending on the sweetness of the watermelon, you may want to add
more or less sugar. Tasters in the Times Test Kitchen liked it best
on the tangy side. If you're having a party, serve this drink in a

<LD>Serious shoppers arrive before the opening horn every Wednesday at

much good stuff these days, and the best goes fast.</LD>

Youngberries grown by Robert Poole of Redlands are among the prime
early attractions. Though he toiled a whole day in 92-degree heat to
pick 14 flats, he was cleaned out in a little more than an hour by
chefs scouring last week's market.</LD>
<LD>   Kim Boyce, pastry chef of Campanile, said she'd make sherbet of
her boysenberries, and compote to go with creme fraiche semifreddo;
Sherry Yard of Spago thought she'd make her Youngberries into a jam
to fill a lemon crepe. The berries will be around for a few more
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Sager of Arroyo Grande has nice, sweet snow peas,
blueberries and a few boxes of delicate "white mulberries," actually
black in color, and much milder than the intense Persian mulberries,
which come in July and August. His white mulberry crop may be
finished this week, but Fairview Gardens should start selling its
harvest at today's market. Fairview also has slender, pricey haricots
verts.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the season's first heirloom tomatoes made their debut.
Tutti-Frutti Organic Farm of Lompoc has German Striped, Tangerine and
Cherokee tomatoes, while James Birch of Three Rivers is offering
tasty little Sungold cherry tomatoes, along with dazzling Goldbar
zucchini.</TE>
<TE>   The Anjin II fish stand, much beloved by regulars, has been
bringing in superbly fresh sand dabs, local silver salmon and giant
live prawns. David West, who gets his wild mushrooms from foragers in
Northern California ("They're as secretive as drug dealers," he says,
should continue to have splendid morels and porcini for a few more
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the market's many cherry vendors are winding down, but the
Bozzini stand still has ample supplies of dark, firm Bings from
Stockton. Scott Family Farm has large, luscious Helena apricots, one
of the better varieties, at the moment, from the San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The real treasure this morning, however--early shoppers, take
note--will be at the Honey Crisp stand, where Reedley farmer Art
Lange's son, Kurt, should have the first picking of Snow Queen white
nectarines, an old-fashioned variety with dense texture, ideal
sugar-acid balance and complex, lingering flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Look for them also at the Encino, Malibu and Beverly Hills markets
on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica farmers market, Arizona Avenue and 2nd Street,
Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.</TE>

<LD>There's no reason to limit a relish to the condiment dish. A relish
can make a wonderful sauce or can have enough substance to be a side
dish. Here, strawberries and avocado combine to become a perfect
companion for grilled chicken and pasta.</LD>
<LD>   Pound the chicken thinly to speed up grilling time. Meanwhile,
cook the pasta. You can use any pasta shape, but I like fusilli; it
tends to capture the relish in its crevices.</LD>
<LD>   Be sure to chop all of your relish ingredients into small and
equal sizes to ensure each bite captures every flavor.</LD>

<TE>   Grilled Chicken With Fusilli and Strawberry Avocado Relish</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 1 1/4 pounds</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups strawberries, chopped into small dice</TE>
<TE>   1 ripe, firm avocado, pitted and chopped into small dice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup finely chopped red onion</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint leaves</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound fusilli</TE>
<TE>   Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Meanwhile, pound the
chicken breasts, 2 at a time, to flatten. Place the chicken, smooth
side up, between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet,
gently and evenly pound the chicken to about  1/4 inch thick. Set
aside in the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the strawberries, avocado, red onion, mint and basil
leaves in a small mixing bowl. Add the balsamic vinegar and 2
tablespoons of the olive oil, and season to taste with salt and
pepper. Set aside at room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a grill pan or a grill over high heat. Place the remaining
tablespoon of olive oil on a plate. Remove the chicken from the
refrigerator, dredge each chicken breast in the oil, coating both
sides, and season with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Once the grill is hot, grill the chicken until cooked through and
the juices run clear, about 3 minutes a side.</TE>
<TE>   While the chicken is grilling, add the fusilli to the water and
cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and toss the pasta
with half of the relish, keeping it warm until you are ready to
serve.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the pasta among 4 plates, placing a grilled chicken breast
on top. Spoon equal amounts of the remaining relish over each breast.</TE>

<HD>A Surprising Taste of Tijuana</HD>
<DH>The city where tourists go for trinkets isn't known for
fine dining. But it should be.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TIJUANA--This border city is as chaotic as ever, a brash jumble of
shops selling T-shirts and cheap trinkets, liquor stores, auto repair
places and tacky nightclubs, dental offices, pharmacies, money
changers and taco grills, all jammed together without logic.</LD>
<LD>   Tune this out, and visualize Tijuana as a place to go for great
food and wine. Hard to believe? Perhaps, but an amazing food scene
does exist here.</LD>
<LD>   It's largely unknown to visitors, because most of them never see
the restaurants--they head straight for Avenida Revolucion, with its
honky-tonk bars and patient burros posing for photos. But there is
fine dining to be found even there, and it's increasingly appreciated
by Mexicans in the know, even by some savvy tourists.</LD>
<TE>   It's not an overstatement to say that the food at Tijuana's better
restaurants, many of them in the Zona Rio, a few blocks from the
center of town, is world-class. La Diferencia, which opened there two
years ago, brings in queso de cabra (goat cheese) from Puebla, moles
from Puebla and Oaxaca, cecina (salted dried beef) from Morelos and
crocodile meat from Sinaloa. (The crocodile is used for machaca, a
special not on the printed menu.) Only about 30% of La Diferencia's
customers are American.</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana even has a celebrity chef, Martin San Roman, who is
inventing a Baja-French-Mexican fusion style of cooking at Rincon San
Roman on the outskirts of town. "Tijuana people are more interested
in food and wine," he says. "They are becoming connoisseurs."</TE>
<TE>   The population has grown remarkably. Tijuana is now Mexico's
seventh largest city, with an estimated 1.3 million inhabitants. That
is almost three times its population in the early 1980s. Growing in
size and affluence, the city can support more and better places to
eat.</TE>
<TE>   But don't rule out Avenida Revolucion. There is lots to discover
in this area, such as a Cuban espresso bar that could be in Havana, a
charming French cafe, a serious winery, shops where you can buy
tortillas that are incredibly light and fragrant, and stores that
specialize in fine pottery and glassware. Prices are mostly
reasonable--for example, freshly baked bolillos (soft rolls) cost
about 15 cents. But don't be surprised to also find a sculptured
glass vase for $400.</TE>
<TE>   Our walking tour covers six blocks of Revolucion, heads three
blocks to the west and doubles back to the L.A. Cetto Winery. For
lunch, we'll wander a little farther, to La Diferencia.</TE>
<TE>   Start early enough to arrive for breakfast. You can park on the
California side of the border and take the Mexicoach shuttle to the
depot just off Revolucion between 6th and 7th streets. Or drive over
and park at the first stop, Sanborns, which is across the street from
a Tijuana landmark, the jai alai fronton.</TE>
<TE>   Massage parlors may border the parking lot, but Sanborns is a
classy place, a chain that started in Mexico City in 1903. Locals
meet in the large, cheerful dining room for generous breakfasts. A
basket of pan dulce (sweet breads) appears as soon as you sit down,
and waitresses start plying you with coffee. Notice their costumes.
The striped skirts represent Puebla, the lacy white blouses Oaxaca
and the crisp little huipils over the shoulders Nayarit.</TE>
<TE>   Try huevos divorciados--two fried eggs that are "divorced" and
therefore have separate salsas, one green the other red. Spoonfuls of
beans and chilaquiles keep them apart. Sweet mole sauce covers huevos
sincronizados--fried eggs on tortillas stacked with ham and cheese.
Another option is chilaquiles, fried tortilla strips mixed with salsa
and chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfasts come with juice, coffee and grilled, buttered bolillos.
They're inexpensive, a little more than $4 for the divorced eggs and
$5 for the chilaquiles. You pay extra for special drinks such as a
frothy, pale chartreuse blend of orange juice and nopal cactus.</TE>
<TE>   Sanborns' large store offers a wide variety of quality
merchandise--books, perfumes, jewelry, electronic products, leather
goods, CDs by Latino artists, pastries, dainty chocolate candies and
typical crafts. Standouts recently were blue-rimmed, handblown
glasses with intricately painted ceramic stems by Quimineral, as well
as Letitia Guevara's miniature ceramic reproductions of colonial
buildings, including a kitchen like that of the Convent of Santa Rosa
in Puebla, where mole poblano was created. You could take that
charming little kitchen home for about $118.</TE>
<TE>   Farther down Revolucion, H. Arnold displays dining accessories in
Puebla's famous Talavera ware. This shop also offers a large
assortment of place mats and runners hand-woven in Santo Tomas
Jalieza, a town in the state of Oaxaca where a women's cooperative
runs the weaving business. The mats are $6 each--a lot more than in
Santo Tomas, where a set of eight runs about $12, but think what
you're saving on air fare. Handsome glass vases at H. Arnold can cost
up to $400--that's for a jumbo, angular blue vase that is more of a
work of art than a flower holder.</TE>
<TE>   When you need a coffee break, sidle up to Solo Cafe, which
dispenses cappuccinos, lattes and such through a window opening onto
Revolucion. The courtly gray-haired proprietor is Alberto Mejia, from
Zaragoza, Spain. Or drop into La Villa del Tabaco for a sip of Cuban
espresso at the coffee bar. This shop imports coffee and cigars from
Havana. Stacked cigar boxes form the stands for lamps on either side
of the comfy leather sofa where smokers lounge. The cigars are
displayed on shelves behind glass. The espressos, which you can
sweeten with coarse-grained Mexican sugar, are $1.50.</TE>
<TE>   Just behind this shop is a branch of Gigante, one of many
supermarkets scattered throughout Tijuana. Here, you'll find staples
such as plump, chewy long-grained Morelos rice and Aladino brand
peanut butter, so renowned in Mexico that peanut butter cookies are
sometimes called Aladinos. In the center of the store, warm bolillos
intermittently drop down a chute onto the sales counter.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's time to explore the back streets. Instead of nightclub
touts and vendors with trays of fake jewelry, you may come across a
woman peeling brilliant green cactus paddles, teenage schoolgirls
chattering uproariously during class break or a gardener tending
roses in the well-kept yard of a house that looks out of place
between humdrum storefronts. You'll see that Tijuana is a city of
ordinary people, not just a tourist hangout.</TE>
<TE>   Stop first at the tourist information booth on Revolucion just
before 3rd Street for a map and the booklet, "Tijuana at a Glance,"
which lists the foods that can be taken into the United States. Now
cross 3rd and walk one block to Constitucion. Turn left and look for
El Kiosko, a stand stacked with traditional candies such as dulce de
leche, the milk fudge called jamoncillo and white coconut alfajores,
as well as candied calabaza (squash) and camote (sweet potato). It's
next to a pharmacy.</TE>
<TE>   Buy a chunk of chilacayota, a large squash with a stringy center.
Bite through the crisp, sugary surface to the succulent, moist flesh
and see how the syrup-soaked shreds have become as clear as glass.
Each piece costs 85 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Return to 3rd and continue to two housewares shops, the
Cristaleria Dresden and Venecia, which have done business in Tijuana
for decades. Their stock includes clay ollas for beans, copper
casseroles called cazuelas, paella pans, blue-enameled saucepans,
wooden tortilla presses, lime squeezers, grinders for corn and
molcajetes (the stone mortars use for making guacamole and sauces).
Utensils that would be hard to find at home include an electric
tortilla press, used to flatten and prebake flour tortillas, which
are then finished on a comal (griddle). What looks like a heavy pasta
machine is for rolling out tortillas. Both shops carry flaneras.
These lightweight, covered molds, which cost less than $6, are
designed for flan prepared the old way--steamed in a kettle of water.</TE>
<TE>   Cross the next street, Ninos Heroes, and walk on 3rd to the
Panaderia La Tapatia, a large bakery with a scrumptious assortment of
pan dulce. Especially good are cocadas, which are soft, fat, pointed
macaroons, and savory breads filled with cream cheese and jalapenos.
You'll see these on the main counter. Other breads, with such names
as picon, ciudadela, chorreada, trenza, concha, corico and sema, are
stacked on shelves and carts. Pick up a tray and tongs and help
yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sweet breads cost 32 cents to 42 cents. The jalapeno
and cheese-stuffed loaves are 85 cents. Looking down on the breads is
a portrait of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint, which
has been lovingly garlanded with plastic flowers and white tulle.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, you may encounter the irresistible aroma of fresh, hot
corn tortillas. The source is the Tortilleria la Nueva Unica across
3rd Street. The tortillas are hand-packed as they drop off the
conveyor belt. A 1-kilo stack of three dozen costs 70 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Next door is an ice cream shop, Paletas y Nieves Lindo Michoacan,
decorated in dazzling stripes of red, orange, yellow, blue and green.
A freezer box is crammed with paletas--frozen ices on a stick--in
exotic flavors such as guava, mango with chile, cucumber with chile,
arroz con leche (rice pudding), jamaica and tart-sweet arrayan.</TE>
<TE>   If you prefer flour tortillas to corn, walk back to Ninos Heroes
and turn right. Between 5th and 6th streets, you will come to the
Tortilleria la Adelita, which sells whole-wheat tortillas as well as
those made with white flour.</TE>
<TE>   At 7th Street, turn left and cross Ninos Heroes, heading back
toward Revolucion. Soon a tantalizing aroma indicates the presence of
another tortilla shop, the Tortilleria la Poblanita. Here the
tortillas are made from ground dried corn, not masa flour. If you've
never had a freshly made corn tortilla, eat one on the spot. It will
melt in your mouth.</TE>
<TE>   On 7th, just before Revolucion, is La Belle Claude, a pretty
little French cafe that serves freshly brewed coffees from Veracruz,
Chiapas and Cuba for about $1 a cup. Flavored coffees include one
laced with rompope, the Mexican eggnog liqueur. Elaborately iced
chocolate cakes, cheesecakes, cupcakes and cookies will stave off
hunger--but save room for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   The last stop before lunch is the L.A. Cetto Winery. Walk up
Constitucion to 10th Street, then bear right at a diagonal to a
large, wooden, L-shaped building. The central part of the L is a
monumental wine cask. Inside is a wine shop and tasting room, where
you can watch a winemaking video or arrange a tour of the premises.
L.A. Cetto's vineyards are in the Guadalupe Valley outside Ensenada,
but wines are aged and bottled here.</TE>
<TE>   Tasters pay $2 to sample one of three groups of wine. The top of
the line group contains just two wines, the 2000 Chardonnay and 1996
limited reserve Nebbiolo. The other groups contain more options,
including sweet wines. Instead of standing at the counter, you can
sit comfortably at a table, setting the glasses on a place mat-chart
that describes each wine. The wines are reasonable, compared with
many in California. The Nebbiolo is about $9 a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   For lunch, take a taxi, or drive to the Zona Rio. This thriving
area offers everything from sushi cafes to Pizza Hut. Keep going--La
Diferencia is where we're headed.</TE>
<TE>   A sign on a house-like structure on Boulevard Sanchez Taboada says
La Diferencia, but this is a tuxedo shop, not the restaurant. Follow
the driveway at one side to the large whitewashed building in back. A
figure that could be Don Quixote leans over a balcony above the
entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, you're in the patio of a colonial hacienda, covered to
guard against the weather. A tiled fountain splashes in the center.
Birds hop about their cages, singing merrily. Pots sprout greenery,
and walls are painted with flowers. Lunch is late in Mexico, so the
restaurant may be busy at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The menu offers a wide selection of Baja wines, including labels
such as Cetto, Domecq, Monte Xanic, Santo Tomas and Casa de Piedra. A
soft, full Cabernet-Zinfandel from Chateau Camou ($5.50 a glass)
shows how good Mexican wines can be.</TE>
<TE>   La Diferencia makes a terrific tamarind margarita--that's what one
customer got by mistake when ordering a nonalcoholic agua de
tamarindo. The glass is rimmed with chile-salt. If you're
adventurous, you can munch on traditional Oaxacan snacks such as
chapulines (grasshoppers) or gusanos de maguey (maguey worms). Or
maybe escamoles (ant eggs) from Hidalgo. The waiter suggested all of
these; they're not on the menu.</TE>
<TE>   The bread basket contains tiny tamales that turn out to be cheese
spread for the rolls, wrapped in corn husks. Salsa, black bean dip
and chips also come with the meal.</TE>
<TE>   Salsa does a star turn when the waiter wheels a cart to the table
and makes one to your order, starting with either jalapenos or pureed
chiles de arbol. Crushing a tomatillo in a molcajete, he puts in
arbol chiles, a garlic clove roasted until almost black and chicken
consomme powder instead of salt, producing a very spicy salsa with
roasted flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The long menu is such a relief from standardized Mexican food
north of the border that you may have trouble choosing. We started
with budin de flor de calabaza, a pudding made with squash flowers,
corn, zucchini and cheese on a bed of poblano chile salsa.</TE>
<TE>   Or you could have squash flower soup, or a broth that contains
fresh verdolagas, which are now in season, chunky little potatoes and
large pieces of fresh cactus.</TE>
<TE>   Crisply browned duck comes with a sour-sweet sauce made from dried
red jamaica flowers and honey. Local seafood, in a vibrant achiote
and orange juice sauce, arrives in a pale bundle. The wrapping is
fibrous mixiote from the maguey plant.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbit also is prepared en mixiote. Other choices include quail in
peanut mole; chicken breast with a sauce of chipotle chile, bacon and
white wine; shrimp in tamarind mole; shrimp enchiladas with hazelnut
sauce and fresh salmon with a mango-habanero chile sauce. That should
give some idea of the scope of the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The dessert tray displays samples of tarta de elote (corn tart),
gaznates (meringue-stuffed cones), chongos (milk curds in syrup),
sliced ate de membrillo (quince paste) with cheese and a cake made
with cajeta, which is a Mexican caramel sauce. The tarta, like
cornbread in a pastry shell, seemed dry until soaked with rompope
poured from a little pitcher on the side. Lunch for four runs about
$100, including a first course and main dish for each, as well drinks
and side dishes--salsas, breads and tortillas.</TE>
<TE>   The day tour is now over, unless you decide to stay overnight.
There are plenty of hotels in the Zona Rio, and lingering another day
will give you the chance to try Rincon San Roman for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, head for the border. Scary stories about long waits
have no foundation, unless you're crossing at peak hours on a holiday
or weekend. Traveling by car, we waited just 20 minutes at 6 on a
Thursday evening. The guard did check our trunk, however. It seems
that people who go to Tijuana just for the food are suspicious enough
to require inspection.</TE>

<HD>Baja's Most Ambitious Chef</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>"I want to be the Mexican Wolfgang Puck. That is my goal," says
Martin San Roman. This 40-year-old Tijuana chef has already bested
Puck in one respect--he owns 120 red Ferraris. These are miniatures,
to be sure, but San Roman's ambitions, and his credits, are not.</LD>
<LD>   His restaurant, Rincon San Roman, is in the forefront of the
thriving new food scene in Tijuana. And his intriguing
Baja-French-Mexican cuisine has drawn international attention. Today
he will cook for Mexico's President Vicente Fox. Bill Clinton has
also tasted his food.</LD>
<LD>   Cut out to be a star, San Roman is good-looking, has a bright,
engaging personality and a solid foundation of training at Ecole
Lenotre in France. He's a TV celebrity too. For 6 1/2 years, he has
appeared on Televisa's weekly "Del Chef a Usted" (From the Chef to
You).</LD>
<TE>   You might wonder why a chef of this stature has settled in
Tijuana, when he could go anywhere. "You are right--I have had offers
from London, Chicago, Australia, even Morocco," he says. "But I
think, 'I am Mexican, and I have to make it here.' Food-wise, I can
get everything I want from Baja as well as from the world. For me,
Baja is the greatest state in Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Mexico City of Basque ancestry, San Roman opened La Tour
de France in Tijuana in 1989. His classical French food rose high
above the tacos, carne asada and refried beans then typical of the
city. San Roman closed that restaurant last year to concentrate on
Rincon.</TE>
<TE>   "Slowly, Tijuana is changing," he says. "In the near future, it
will be the gastronomic place in Mexico. We have the best wine
country in Mexico. We can get any kind of fish and seafood. We export
organic products such as baby lettuces, baby vegetables and many
quality items."</TE>
<TE>   Like San Roman, Rincon stands apart. It is located on a peaceful
hillside at Real del Mar, 12 miles from Tijuana's frenetic core. No
signs advertise its presence. A guard raises a barrier to let
visitors onto the grounds. The road winds quietly past a golf course
and a Marriott hotel. The restaurant is across from the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   It is a shock to find club sandwiches and hamburgers on the menu.
Those are for golfers who want a quick lunch, the chef explains. But
there is also an appetizer of deep-fried panela cheese filled with
ate de membrillo, a golden quince paste. The blend of meltingly soft
cheese with sweet quince is ravishing. San Roman dots the plate with
strawberry coulis and spoons on pico de gallo made from strawberries,
papaya, jalapenos and onions. Crisp, thin strips of corn tortilla
tumble over the cheese, and a basil sprig sits on top. It is an
extraordinary dish, a startling combination of flavors, and it
typifies the way San Roman updates traditional Mexican dishes--sliced
cheese with quince paste is a common dessert in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   For his chayote lasagna, he stacks chayote squash, spinach, tomato
and Oaxaca-style cheese, then surrounds the stack with cilantro oil,
diced tomato and cilantro leaves. Crab quesadillas perch against an
avocado half that contains guacamole and a dab of wildly hot habanero
chile compote. Corn husk strips sprout from the center of the
avocado, and avocado slices are fanned in front beside a few leaves
of baby lettuce. A single gaufrette potato slice punctuates this
arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "Pave de boeuf aux escargots--filet of beef with snails, garlic
and tomato sauce--is my signature dish," San Roman says. "The best
dessert is the crepe cake with dark and white chocolate mousse. This
dessert is my invention, and all Tijuana knows about it. I call it
pastel de crepas Tijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Specials one night are beef brains in red wine sauce with shallots
and filet of sole stuffed with salmon in a beurre blanc sauce. "The
specials are always French," San Roman says. "I would never leave my
training in classic French cuisine. That's what I love. For me, it's
the best cuisine, but I like to mix it with the Mexican."</TE>
<TE>   At a reception following President Fox's speech at a journalists'
convention in Tijuana today, San Roman plans to serve salmon in a
vinaigrette seasoned with chipotle chiles and honey; quail marinated
in Baja red wine, beef in tamarind sauce and California chiles filled
with the truffle-like corn fungus huitlacoche and marinated with
Mexican brown sugar and vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   Although San Roman likes to update and glamorize Mexican food,
some things he leaves alone. The Caesar salad on his menu is the
Tijuana original.</TE>
<TE>   He calls his style "cocina del autor," meaning dishes that he
creates. "I try to fusion the Mexican and the French," he says, "but
I am not the kind of chef that likes to fusion everything. I like to
do something original." Although Baja can supply fresh herbs, San
Roman will eventually grow his own behind the restaurant. Near the
herb plot will be a barbecue pit for authentic Mexican barbacoa.</TE>
<TE>   The simple, clean lines of Rincon San Roman reflect his fresh,
contemporary style. "This is a new building," he says, "but it looks
like an old village in Spain, or a house in Queretaro," the colonial
city in central Mexico. Large windows look toward the Pacific and the
Coronado Islands. Walls are painted blue, orange or white. Red
carnations in cobalt blue bottles stand on tables covered with teal
cloths and white overlays. The architect, Jose Luis Martinez Blanco,
lives in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary paintings by Cecilia Garcia Amaro, also of Tijuana,
hang on the walls along with framed vintage sheet music from France,
a scene of the Moulin Rouge, and San Roman's culinary memorabilia.
One frame shows off the Star Diamond award from the American Academy
of Hospitality Sciences in New York, naming him a top chef. Wolfgang
Puck also holds that honor.</TE>
<TE>   One of few Mexican chefs accepted into the Academie Culinaire de
France, San Roman is anything but pretentious. For lunch one day, he
leaps up from the table, saying, "I am going to do something simple,
something delicious." And he heads for a barbecue that is smoking
outside the kitchen door.</TE>
<TE>   Here he grills carne asada--thin-cut Mexican sirloin that has
soaked for 24 hours with orange juice, orange slices, onions, oil,
salt and oregano. He finishes the plate with a strip of grilled
cactus and a long, green chile filled with panela cheese, covered
with sauteed vegetables, tomato sauce and cotija cheese.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to do Mexican food that you can drink with wine," he says.
His choice for this lunch is Terra, from L.A. Cetto's newly released
Don Luis line. Produced from grapes grown near Ensenada, Terra blends
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and was aged one
year in oak and 12 months in the bottle.</TE>
<TE>   San Roman is an advisor to California chefs who will compete in
the 2004 Culinary Olympics in Germany. Mexican embassies invite him
overseas, and he has taught at the Cordon Bleu in Paris and London.
On June 22, he will cook a Baja wine dinner at the Hilton La Jolla
Torrey Pines.</TE>
<TE>   There are catering jobs too, meals for film personalities working
in Baja and plans for a boutique in Tijuana, where he will sell
chef's equipment, wines and ingredients, including the organic coffee
that he brings from Chiapas. He is also working on a Spanish-language
show for the Food Network.</TE>
<TE>   Still, San Roman still has time to play soccer, go to movies and
relax with his wife, Marion, and four children. "I know how to
delegate," he says. And he's a relaxed sort of guy. "They call me the
bluejean chef, because I wear bluejeans all the time. That's my
style."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rincon San Roman is about 12 miles south of Tijuana. Take the toll
road, Carretera Tijuana Ensenada, to the Real del Mar exit, which
leads directly to the Mariott Residence Inn. The restaurant is across
the street. The phone number is 011-52-664-631-2241.</TE>

<HD>The Memories Pour Forth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tasting an older wine that's still in good shape is, in a real sense,
time travel. It offers a genuine connection with the past, the actual
smell and flavor of fruit ripening slowly through summer days long
past.</LD>
<LD>   That was amply demonstrated by a recent tasting of more than 40
California Cabernets, mostly from Napa Valley, from 1940 to the
present. Each was a vibrant, purple-tinted snapshot of a bygone time.
Together, they showed how far the California style has evolved from
the Bordeaux-style clarets of yore to the current paradigm of
extremely ripe, high-alcohol wines.</LD>
<LD>   The tasting was sponsored by Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in
association with the American Wine History Project of the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum of American History. Five historians
from the Smithsonian documented the tasting as part of the
Institution's Wine History Project, tracing wine in America from
Thomas Jefferson's time to the present. The wines were assembled by
Zachy's rare wine consultant, Dennis Foley, from the cellars of
several longtime collectors, and the event was moderated by Bon
Appetit wine editor Anthony Dias Blue.</LD>
<TE>   Quite a few had aged well enough through the decades to provide a
sensory trip back in time.</TE>
<TE>   The jammy 1940 Simi Claret evoked the determined reawakening of
Sonoma County viticulture in the aftermath of Prohibition. The 1945
Casa de Sonoma, still harmonious and silk-smooth, inspired
recollections of the late August Sebastiani and the long-gone El
Gavilan Winery, where he made the wine.</TE>
<TE>   The 1951 Beaulieu, an elegant garnet beauty with deep luscious
flavor and a long tobacco-inflected finish, moved collector George
Linton, who contributed many of the BV and Inglenook wines in the
tasting, to a more personal recollection. He noted that Andre
Tchelistcheff's assistant winemaker at that time was Joseph Heitz.
"One day Joe told me that they had fined four barrels of the '51 with
egg whites," recalled Linton. "So I bought some to compare with the
regular gelatin-fined wine. At $1 a bottle, I could afford it." Heitz
also had a hand in the magnificent '58 BV, one of seven wines on
display from that great vintage.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the others in that flight were rare cask-designated
bottlings from Inglenook, also contributed by Linton. A historical
mystery surrounds those bottlings. It's believed that the letters and
numbers on the labels refer to specific blends, but nobody knows
exactly what they mean. According to Linton, the mystery began when
John Daniels Jr. sold Inglenook to United Vintners in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   "There was great resentment in the Napa Valley that Inglenook was
sold to investors, rather than winemakers," said Linton. "The rumor
was that winemaker George Deuer was so angry he destroyed the cellar
books. At any rate, they were never found." Perhaps something
valuable was lost with the cellar books. The '58 Cask F-10, for
example, has matured into a stunning wine. But which blocks of vines
was it from, and how was it made? We'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   Inglenook, BV and Charles Krug carried the early-vintage flights,
but as we moved into the late '60s, the first wave of smaller,
so-called boutique producers showed up. Foremost among them was the
legendary Heitz Cellars, with examples such as the amazing '69
Martha's Vineyard. The modern cult-Cab phenomenon has its roots in
wines like these, although it would be another two decades before the
likes of Colgin and Screaming Eagle. By the mid-'70s, there were
signs of the future in noticeably more sumptuous wines from Caymus,
Joseph Phelps and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy began with flights from the late 1980s. Those were the
last vintages of the foremost Napa Valley Cabernets to be made
largely according to the classical Bordeaux model. When the dust had
cleared from phylloxera replanting in the early '90s, Napa Valley
Cabernet was a very different animal.</TE>
<TE>   People who discovered wine in the 1990s may assume that California
Cabs have always been the rich, high-alcohol fruit bombs typical of
recent years. Not so. In fact, wine style is a moving target, like
fashions in food and clothing.</TE>
<TE>   So one of the persistent topics of conversation among the tasters
was whether the new style of Napa Valley wine will age as well as
those impressively young old-timers. Will a Cabernet in the modern
style--big, extracted, high-alcohol--be as lovely after 50 years in
the bottle as, say, the Inglenook '51?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're going for the same values, but on a greater level
of magnitude," noted Stag's Leap proprietor Warren Winiarski. "It's
dangerous, because it's easy to get overpowering proportions at that
level. But we're playing with the danger."</TE>
<TE>   I share many observers' doubts about the top-heavy wines. But I
would love to be able to taste, say, a '99 Stag's Leap Cask 23 in
2049, and admire it.</TE>

<DH>1999 Swanson Vineyards Merlot, Napa Valley</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Swanson Vineyards has a 14-year track record for serious, beautifully
made reds. Its Sangiovese gets a lot of attention, but its 1999
Merlot is no slouch. Ripe for drinking now, it's actually a deft
blend of Merlot with touches of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc
and Syrah. The initial impression is luscious cherries and plums
laced with a bright, entrancing acidity. Tannins are round and soft,
and the finish is sweet as summer. You can't stop drinking it.</LD>
<LD>   About $25. Available at most fine wine shops and retailers. If you
can't find it, call the winery at (707) 967-3500.</LD>

<HD>Drawn to This Line of Work</HD>
<DH>Movies* No computers for independent animator Bill
Plympton. He draws every frame of his surreal projects, which include
the new 'Mutant Aliens.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS BEALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If Bill Plympton likes to draw every frame of every animated film he
produces, does that make him the Luddite of the cartoon world?</LD>
<LD>   Certainly the 25,000 personalized illustrations in "Mutant
Aliens," Plympton's latest feature project, serve as an interesting
contrast to the three-dimensional, computer-generated images in
studio blockbusters like "Shrek" and "Toy Story." And that's just
fine with Bill Plympton.</LD>
<LD>   "I really like the look of the pencil line. It's real fantasy,"
says the writer, producer, director and entrepreneur, whose film
opens Friday in Los Angeles. "I just love to draw. There's nothing
better than for me to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning and draw all
day."</LD>
<TE>   An Oregon native who has lived in New York for upward of 30 years,
Plympton is more than just a speed-drawing whiz who can knock off 200
renderings a day. He finances his own films; he's done five,
including two animated features, "The Tune" (1992) and "I Married a
Strange Person" (1998), and has occasionally self-distributed them.
He makes cartoons with R-rated material in a medium generally thought
of as kiddie-centric.</TE>
<TE>   And he is a self-taught entrepreneur who has learned how to
increase his bottom line by selling everything from Plympton-inspired
T-shirts to books and CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Plympton "definitely is an anomaly" in the animation world, says
Rita Street, online editor of Animation magazine. "He succeeds
because he sticks to his vision, and he does it all by himself."</TE>
<TE>   It's a style that's not for all tastes. Bawdy and bloody, surreal
and free-form, Plympton's work seems, at first glance, to be aimed
solely at pizza-eating frat boys. He loves off-color jokes,
big-busted women and animated riffs that appear to come out of
nowhere. As Plympton puts it, his output is "a blend of Magritte and
R. Crumb--that European surrealism, but the weird, goofy sexual
craziness of R. Crumb."</TE>
<TE>   Plympton is not the only cartoonist working in this realm. Thanks
to "The Simpsons," "South Park," Japanese anime and MTV, animation
for adults is no longer limited to the occasional "Fritz the Cat"
feature or a 1930s cartoon porno loop. But Plympton stands out
because of his cult following, the sheer goofiness of some of his
films, and his occasionally maddening indifference to pacing and
plot.</TE>
<TE>   In "Mutant Aliens," for example, a stranded astronaut discovers
that a group of lab animals sent into outer space is still alive. The
astronaut breeds their offspring and then returns with them to Earth,
where they wreak revenge against the scientists who abandoned them.
This weird tale is told with the usual Plympton flourishes: plenty of
explosions, cartoony sex jokes, striking color schemes and an
off-the-wall sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing a Plympton cartoon is like watching illustrations that
move. Fully animated films such as "The Lion King" use 24 drawings
per second to create a sense of fluid action, but Plympton's
budgetary and time constraints force him to use only six. This tends
to slow down the pacing of his work, but it is compensated for by
visual stylization and zaniness. The films can, however, be quite
off-putting--especially if you've been weaned on the lush look of
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all this, or maybe because of it, both "Mutant Aliens" and
Plympton's previous film, "I Married a Strange Person," have been
awarded the grand prize for feature films at the Annecy (France) Film
Festival, the Cannes of the animation world.</TE>
<TE>   Plympton says he is sometimes accused of being misogynistic or
obsessed with violence, but in reality he is simply filming "what
makes me laugh. I think if [the 1940s screwball animator] Tex Avery
were alive today, he would do these really offensive, outlandish,
pushing-the-edge cartoons. In a sense, I'm sort of his son, but I'm
pushing the limits of good taste, and I think that's important,
because animation needs to break out of its stereotype."</TE>
<TE>   "He's an auteur, that's his vision, that's what he likes," adds
Heather Kenyon of the Animation World Network Web site, awn.com.
"Everybody has their fans and those who are less than enthused about
their work. OK, you don't like the violence, the girls with the big
boobs; that's his vision."</TE>
<TE>   Plympton's vision comes out of an unlikely place--a cosmically
cluttered loft in the Chelsea section of New York, which doubles as
his living quarters and studio. Scattered around the space are
shelves filled with videocassettes, props and books, a drawing table
and a copying machine used for transferring his drawings to acetate
cels. There is also a video camera, which Plympton uses to test his
work, and a worktable on which his assistants color the cels. All the
drawings and cels from his films, about 100,000 in all, are stacked
in boxes around the room.</TE>
<TE>   The driving force behind this mess is a tall, slim, soft-spoken
man who looks younger than his 55 years. Born and raised in Portland,
Plympton was influenced by Daffy Duck and Mickey Mouse at an early
age and always wanted to be an animator. He majored in graphic design
at Portland State University, then moved to New York, where he
studied animation for a short time at the School of Visual Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Plympton began his career as an illustrator and political
cartoonist, working for publications as diverse as Vogue, the Village
Voice and Penthouse. His big break as an animator came in 1983, when
a female friend suggested that he animate "Boomtown," a song by
cartoonist Jules Feiffer. The seven-minute film, a musical parable of
the Cold War, wound up playing at several film festivals. Its minor
success led Plympton to put up $2,000 of his own money to make
another short called "Your Face," about a sleazy crooner whose face
changes in surreal ways as he sings a cornball love song. That film
won more than a dozen awards, was Oscar-nominated and sold to MTV.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized [after that]," says Plympton, "I had been wasting my
life doing these illustrations when I could be making animation and
making a lot of money and getting famous around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Plympton was savvy. Unlike the many independent animators who know
little or nothing about the business end of their field, Plympton
realized early on that he could make a lot more money if he financed
his own projects, held on to the rights and became involved in
ancillary markets like merchandising. He learned how to negotiate
contracts and even distributed some films on his own, going from
theater to theater with his prints, making a live presentation before
the show and selling T-shirts and other tchotchkes afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The key to Plympton's financial success is that he can make enough
money on his short films to finance his features. His market includes
foreign and domestic TV, video and theatrical sales, and the
occasional educational deal--his 1989 humorous short "25 Ways to Quit
Smoking" has been sold to scores of schools, which use it as an
anti-smoking message film.</TE>
<TE>   Plympton has also learned the art of pre-sales. "Mutant Aliens,"
which cost about $200,000 to produce (it's being distributed by
L.A.-based Apollo Cinema), has already made its money back thanks to
theatrical, TV and video sales in France, Germany, Korea and other
countries. Of course, it's all chump change compared with
feature-length studio animation. At most, Plympton can expect to see
his films in 200 theaters nationwide, usually art houses and college
campus venues. His biggest payday came from "I Married a Strange
Person," which cost $250,000 to produce and grossed $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   But limited success is still success. Now Plympton is planning his
next big step. He wants to set up a mini-studio with full-time
animation and office help, which will allow him the leisure to sit at
his desk and do what he does best: draw. Plympton is searching for
another loft space to move his business into, overseeing the
production of trailers and posters for "Mutant Aliens" and doing
preliminary sketches for his next feature, "Hair High." "It's an
animated 'Carrie,' " says Plympton, "a Gothic-high-school, urban-myth
kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Mutant Aliens" opens Friday exclusively at Laemmle's Fairfax

<HD>Picking Up Mixed Signals</HD>
<DH>Television* A merger of KCAL-KCBS news operations brings
promises of better coverage--and job anxiety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plan to merge the news operations of KCAL-TV and KCBS-TV is being
hailed by its managers as a dynamic marriage that will better serve
viewers by combining resources and experience.</LD>
<LD>   But the staffs of the two newsrooms were preoccupied Tuesday with
speculation about probable job cuts because of overlap of the two
operations, which roughly number between 200 and 300 people. And
local news executives and industry observers eyed the move with
uncertainty. Bigger might not necessarily be better, they said.</LD>
<LD>   "The optimist might look at this and say, 'More resources, better
news coverage,' " said Joe Saltzman, associate dean of the USC
Annenberg School for Communication. "But the realist will look at
this and see that the viewers are losing an independent news station,
lessening their options for news. It's not better for them at all."</LD>
<TE>   KCAL-KCBS executives downplayed such concerns, saying the merger
will prove especially beneficial to viewers of KCBS, which they
intend to finally make a contender against its chief news rivals,
KNBC-TV and KABC-TV, after decades of trailing them in news ratings.</TE>
<TE>   The newsroom merger, which was announced Monday and will take
effect in September, is happening because Viacom, which previously
owned only KCBS, won final approval in May for its purchase of KCAL
from Young Broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   The KCAL-KCBS "duopoly"--two stations owned by the same
company--is one of four such arrangements in the Los Angeles TV
market. Federal regulations prohibiting the concentration of media
ownership were relaxed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The combined news operation will be run by Nancy Bauer Gonzales,
who had been KCAL's news director. Her staff will produce newscasts
for both stations, which total 11 hours a day, including KCAL's
three-hour block in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   "There's got to be one leader at the top, and this will eliminate
any confusion that may exist," said Princell Hair, who had been KCBS'
news director since December. Hair is returning to his previous
position as director of news operations for Viacom Television
Stations Group.</TE>
<TE>   No changes in the anchor lineups for the two stations are
immediately planned, but executives acknowledged there may be staff
reductions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're bringing two families together in a marriage, and we will
evaluate the marriage as it evolves," Gonzales said in an interview.
"We don't have any magic numbers or solutions at the moment. We want
to see what we need to add or lose."</TE>
<TE>   Saltzman predicted that a lot of staffers would be let go and
worried that the decisions on who stays on may not be based on
journalism credentials. "They may pick people on cosmetics or on
audience appeal rather than on journalistic standards," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales maintained that viewers will be the major beneficiary of
the joint operation.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be able to serve the Southern California viewer as they've
never been served before," she said. "We will have a huge amount of
coverage, and our emphasis will be on breaking news and local news.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, our overriding mission will be to make sure that content
is king. Unless news is well-written, it doesn't connect with its
audience, so we will be putting a large emphasis on that."</TE>
<TE>   She added that both stations would start focusing more on
community-oriented stories: "One thing that no station does enough of
is stories from where people live. Usually that's because of time
limitations. Now we will have the luxury of doing those stories."</TE>
<TE>   No changes in either station's newscast schedule are planned for
the near future. KCBS has scattered newscasts throughout the day.
KCAL has afternoon newscasts plus the three-hour prime-time block.
The only overlap is at noon, and both those broadcasts will continue
for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   Don Corsini, general manager of the two stations, said KCBS and
KCAL will have distinctive brands despite their merger. "But one of
our goals is to improve KCBS' image in the marketplace," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales, who had previously been news director at KNBC-TV, said
running the massive partnership "will be the biggest challenge of my
career. I'm going to have an incredible management team that will be
able to run both of these operations at once."</TE>
<TE>   Yet to be determined is whether reporters for one station will
appear on the sister station's newscast. "We're experimenting with
the overlap," she said. "We're not sure at this point how much
sharing there will be." KCAL has already started promoting KCBS'
newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   Improving ratings for KCBS will be a major priority of the
duopoly. One Viacom executive called the KCBS news operation
unfocused "and totally lacking in direction. It's lucky they have the
numbers they have."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gonzales: "I think KCBS will really benefit from being under
Don Corsini. Don's a very straight shooter and has a clear sense of
direction."</TE>
<TE>   She said she likes some of the features of KCBS News, particularly
its Special Assignment investigative reports. But she said other
aspects of the newscast are problematic.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a timetable for turning things around there, but it
needs to happen now, not a year from now, not a few months from now,"
Gonzales said. "We really have to hit the ground running."</TE>
<TE>   Competitors of KCBS and KCAL say they were unsure how the merger
will affect competition in the nation's No. 2 TV market.</TE>
<TE>   Said Paula Madison, general manager of KNBC-TV, which airs daytime
and evening newscasts against KCBS, "We'll wait to see how the
merging of the two Viacom stations affects the competitive
environment."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Burton, a spokesman for KABC, which also competes with KCBS
during the day and evening, said, "This is new territory. We don't
know what, if any, impact this will have. In this competitive
environment, we worry about ourselves first, and make sure what we're
doing is right. But clearly, we're in uncharted waters here."</TE>

<LD>To no one's surprise, the NBA Finals topped the TV ratings last week,
but with significantly smaller audiences than last year, figures from
Nielsen Media Research showed Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The third game of the Los Angeles-New Jersey showdown last Sunday
drew the week's largest audience, with an average of 16.2 million
people tuning in to see the Lakers move to within a game of capturing
their third consecutive league championship. But that was 20% lower
than the figure for Game 3 last year, and 32% below the tune-in for
the Lakers' seventh-game playoff against the Sacramento Kings just a
week earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, Game 1 this year was down nearly 15% from last year,
and Game 2 was down 25%.</LD>
<TE>   Still, that showing, combined with good numbers for the
second-season return of "Spy TV," pushed NBC to the No. 1 position
among the networks. The 8:30 p.m. Tuesday outing of "Spy TV," a
"Candid Camera"-type comedy that premiered last summer, garnered the
second-largest audience in the show's history and beat ABC's "The
Mole II."</TE>
<TE>   With the networks' prime-time schedules filled mostly with reruns
of entertainment series, the newsmagazines proved a popular
alternative with many viewers. Four of them finished among the week's
20 most-watched programs.</TE>

<HD>An Achilles' Heel of the Geffen: Climate That Can't Be
Controlled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of artist H.C. Westermann who notice some key sculptures are
missing from the retrospective of his works at the Geffen
Contemporary can blame the weather.</LD>
<LD>   Not outside in Los Angeles but inside the Geffen.</LD>
<LD>   Because of a lack of state-of-the-art climate controls in the
museum, 11 sculptures, primarily made of wood, and related drawings
were withdrawn from the traveling exhibition by their owners,
including the Whitney Museum of American Art and Art Institute of
Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   Most visitors to the comprehensive exhibition, which is spread out
over 13,000 square feet in the former warehouse that is the Geffen,
probably won't notice. But the absence of these works--including a
couple considered vital to Westermann's career--brings to the
forefront a long-standing problem at the Geffen.</TE>
<TE>   The basic hurdle is humidity--modern museums strive to keep their
buildings at about 50% relative humidity, with only 5% daily
fluctuations. The Geffen, like many museum spaces not originally
meant for displaying art, can't maintain that level.</TE>
<TE>   "Wood is particularly vulnerable to changes in moisture in the
air," said Whitney spokeswoman Mary Haus in explaining why that
institution's artworks were withdrawn. "We didn't feel there were
sufficient guarantees with the climate controls to warrant lending
them."</TE>
<TE>   The Whitney sculptures--"Antimobile," and "The Evil New War God
(S.O.B.)" are pictured in the exhibition catalog and were in the show
when it was at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, where it
originated, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers of the Westermann show were contractually obligated
to inform museum lenders of the Geffen humidity situation, said
Michael Rooks, co-curator of the show. Although private lenders did
not have to be told, he informed Gilda Buchbinder, who pulled four
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   He feels the pieces from most private lenders are not inordinately
in danger. "Most Westermann collectors love their pieces and take
incredibly good care of them," he said. "But in a domestic space,
there is no way you can have museum controls--not with cooking,
showers, baths."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Buchbinder, a Chicago resident, didn't want to take the
chance. "I didn't want to be seen as someone who withholds art," she
said. "But we have a responsibility to the pieces we own to preserve
them."</TE>
<TE>   Both the Whitney and Buchbinder said their sculptures would rejoin
the exhibition when it travels to the Menil Collection in Houston in
October. Art Institute officials did not respond to requests for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles say
they have been careful in the past not to book the satellite Geffen
with artworks susceptible to climate fluctuations. The Westermann
show was moved from MOCA's Grand Avenue building to the Geffen after
the museum landed the Andy Warhol retrospective now on view.</TE>
<TE>   "We actually loved the idea of having Westermann at the same time
as Warhol as an interesting complement," said MOCA director Jeremy
Strick. He also said the Geffen was able to devote more space to the
Westermann show, which would have gotten only 6,000 square feet in
the main building.</TE>
<TE>   Rooks, who has been working on the exhibition since 1997, said the
Chicago museum staff was not aware of the extent of the Geffen's
climate-control problems until late April this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our registrar requested hygrothermograph readings, which are done
by those little boxes you see in museums that look like
seismographs," said Rooks. "They measure changes in relative humidity
on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Rooks nor other organizers of the show would give details
on those readings except to say they were outside museum standards
for wooden objects. Strick said the blame could lie with a new
air-conditioning system in the part of the Geffen where the
Westermann show was installed.</TE>
<TE>   The potential for humidity damage to wooden artworks is affected
by numerous factors, including the type and thickness of wood,
according to conservator Paul Himmelstein, a past president of the
American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works.</TE>
<TE>   Because wood sculptures expand and contract with humidity changes,
they are susceptible to warping and cracking. "The big problem is
that once a crack develops, it doesn't go back. It's permanent
damage," said Himmelstein.</TE>
<TE>   In retrofitting a building for climate control, vapor-retarder
sheets made of plastic are normally installed inside walls to help
prevent moisture from seeping in and out. "It's very expensive,"
Himmelstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Cost estimates to install climate controls for the entire Geffen
have ranged has high as $4 million. Strick said MOCA is considering
more limited plans to add the protections to specific sections of the
space.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rooks misses the withdrawn art works in the Westermann
show, he finds a silver lining in the situation at the Geffen. "In
Chicago our idea was to present a comprehensive retrospective," he
said. But L.A. artist Billy Al Bengsten, who designed the
installation for MOCA and was a friend of Westermann's, took a
different tack.</TE>
<TE>   "What he did," Rooks said, "was reorganize it in a personal way,
finding relationships among the pieces so you don't realize the
absences of major works."</TE>

<HD>Beltran Stays Connected to Dance Rhythms</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took a little doing, but Louie Cruz Beltran finally managed to
cram himself and all nine members of his Latin Jazz Nonette onto the
stage at Spazio on Monday night. Four percussionists (including
Beltran), three horn players, a pianist, bassist and vibraphone
player--a potent aggregation, and one that brought some superheated
Latin rhythms and free-flying jazz soloing to the Sherman Oaks jazz
supper club.</LD>
<LD>   Beltran--whose diversified career includes acting, working as a
studio percussionist, touring with everything from Latin jazz groups
to reggae bands, teaching and fronting his own ensemble--was a
gregarious, outgoing host. Introducing his musicians and his songs
with easygoing commentary and quick-take jokes, driving the music
forward with his energetic percussion work, he was the high-voltage
sparkplug for the performance.</LD>
<LD>   The diversity of his musical interests became apparent in the
first two songs of his set. Opening with his own "Cha Cha Negra," he
quickly shifted gears with the second tune, placing his own rhythmic
stamp upon Horace Silver's classic jazz line, "Song for My Father."
Singer-drummer Eric Diaz stepped to the microphone next to add yet
another musical perspective: a sweetly sensual rendering of Alvaro
Carrillo's classic "Sabor a Mi." Beltran followed up with two more
originals, ending with Clare Fischer's lovely work, "Morning."</LD>
<TE>   From a listening perspective, the music was well paced and
engaging. The combination of strong solo work from alto saxophonist
Karolyn Kaffer, trombonist Cotrell Billingsly, trumpeter Serafin
Aguilar and pianist Jeff Micuski, brightly swinging ensemble passages
and an impassioned percussion section produced a set of performances
that stood comfortably on their own.</TE>
<TE>   But for most of the enthusiastic crowd, the ensemble's appeal was
underscored by the danceable rhythms, which cruised easily through
cha-cha, salsa, funk and jazz.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, Beltran--like so many Latin bandleaders--was firmly
in touch with a concept many jazz bandleaders have forgotten: Music
that remains connected to the dance rhythms at its roots will never
lose touch with its audience.</TE>

<HD>PBS Takes Another Try at Looking at 'Life 360'</HD>
<DH>Television* The program, which launched shortly after the
9/11 attacks and was later pulled, returns after some retooling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Life 360" is getting a second chance at life. A new season of its
single-themed episodes begins with a look at "Monuments," or what it
means to remember.</LD>
<LD>   The PBS series, launched last fall, was to have been a centerpiece
of public broadcasting's ambitious attempt to reinvigorate its
lineup. But viewers didn't respond in great numbers to the show's
quirky mix of documentary and performing arts, exploring topics from
food to fate. The series was pulled in January to make way for a more
topical public affairs program from Bill Moyers.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than cancel "Life 360," a co-production of Oregon Public
Broadcasting and ABC News' "Nightline," PBS sent it back for
retooling. KCET will begin airing the new episodes Thursday at 10
p.m. They will continue through the summer.</LD>
<TE>   The series had the unfortunate luck to launch almost immediately
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Initial episodes had to be
reworked to take out some humor, which suddenly seemed inappropriate,
and a big promotional campaign was scrapped. New segments were
quickly put together that examined the aftermath of the attacks, but
viewers' interests were elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The show, said anchor Michel Martin, was "conceived in an
environment where everyone else was doing Gary Condit and one of our
main goals was to do programming that didn't involve eating bugs."</TE>
<TE>   But overnight, she said, the attacks and the resulting foreign
policy upheaval became a cultural marker "that demands that you
absorb it in some way. How to do it is one of the overlying issues
we've been struggling with."</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 still looms large in the first episode, which revolves
around a road trip that contributor Ron Suskind took to South Dakota
following the attacks. He talks to fellow travelers about the
permanence of Mt. Rushmore and the Badlands, and pokes around
kitschier monuments, including a Corn Palace and an oversized
drugstore. ABC's Robert Krulwich is back, with a look at how Grant's
Tomb fell out of fashion. Comedian Jake Johannsen deals directly with
the attacks, examining the kind of monument New Yorkers want to see
in the empty space. Loudon Wainwright sings a tribute to New York.</TE>
<TE>   To pick up the pace this season, the musical interludes in each
hourlong show have been pared from two to one. There are no more live
audiences, and some of the longer pieces have been trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   The animated segments in the program remain, giving a visual twist
to person-on-the-street interviews, and the show still relies on more
relaxed, personal forms of storytelling and not-so-obvious thematic
diversions, such as the examination of roadside accident markers in
the "Monuments" show. One addition is an interview Martin will do
each week to add focus to the topic at hand. "We wanted more
coherence in the exploration of each theme," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A tight budget means the shows are put together far ahead of time,
presenting a challenge to guess what viewers will be interested in
when they are broadcast, Martin said. The summer's nine new
installments will look at the weighty theme of redemption--spinning
off of Sept. 11 again but also venturing into a lighter profile of
the lead understudy of Broadway's "The Producers"--as well as family
secrets, neighbors, even 10-year-olds. Four additional hours will be
repackaged from the fall, with some new material added to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   "Life 360" is meant to be a combination of "the serious, profound
and simply delightful," Martin said. Finding an audience will still
be a challenge as some PBS stations nationwide have relegated the
show to off hours.</TE>
<TE>   "You hope that people understand that when you try things, you
have to experiment, to take risks, and you're not always going to hit
it out of the park on the first try," Martin said. "We think we had a
good show to build on and a better show this season."</TE>

<HD>His Own Man</HD>
<DH>What once made H.C. Westermann exotic now defines him as
terrific.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>H.C. Westermann (1922-1981) never fit the mainstream profile of a
great American artist. That's one reason (among others) that he was
in fact great--as is plainly demonstrated by the large and absorbing
retrospective survey of his sculpture that opened Sunday at the
Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen Contemporary. Westermann's art
has a singular eloquence.</LD>
<LD>   Westermann was born and raised in Los Angeles and went to art
school in Chicago. He resided there and in Connecticut, but he never
lived in New York, where career-minded artists once gravitated.</LD>
<LD>   Like many veterans of World War II, he took advantage of the GI
Bill to pursue art studies (at the School of the Art Institute of
Chicago). Unlike most, he then promptly reenlisted in the Marines and
served in Korea. Death, not surprisingly, is a constant theme in his
sculpture, but it's always rendered in a deeply personal, unheroic
sense.</LD>
<TE>   Westermann's work is informed by a critical admiration for artists
as diverse as the elegantly stylized Elie Nadelman and the puckish
Marcel Duchamp, both European expatriates to the United States. But
his sculpture never seems concerned with wrestling dominant School of
Paris styles to the ground, as much art of the 1950s and 1960s did.</TE>
<TE>   And his work is craft-intensive. Who else would--or could--make a
6-foot sculpture of a sailor's knot from cut, laminated and polished
sheets of Douglas fir? Westermann's sculpture has the look of having
emerged from a tidy workshop out in the garage, not from an urban
atelier or studio.</TE>
<TE>   Westermann, in other words, has many of the hallmarks of an
eccentric outsider. These alien qualities even underscore his embrace
by the Whitney Museum of American Art, which championed folk art,
regularly included him in biennials and organized the last Westermann
retrospective, a quarter-century ago. (Chicago's Museum of
Contemporary Art assembled the one now at MOCA.) The artist's
departure from an aesthetic standard set and monitored in New York
has always been important in assessments of his achievements. It's
been used to set him apart.</TE>
<TE>   Until now. Today, through the forces of globalization, our
perception of art and its relationship to cultural centers and
peripheries is changing drastically. Simultaneously, as Manhattan's
well of new art runs dry, Westermann's place in history is beginning
to look quite distinct. He's gone from being an outsider on the
inside to being just a terrific artist. He's exotic no more.</TE>
<TE>   Westermann has instead become a father of us all. In the end, what
important 20th century artist was not eccentric, alien and outside
the routine norms of contemporary social life?</TE>
<TE>   "Memorial to the Idea of Man if He Was an Idea" (1958) is a key
American sculpture of its decade, and only partly because it breaks
from established formal traditions of casting and carving and moves
aggressively in the direction of assemblage. It's key because it's a
searingly apt portrait of its American moment.</TE>
<TE>   Suitably, the body of Westermann's memorial is a pine box. Built
with the finesse of a skilled cabinetmaker, the body is topped by a
head in the form of a castle. A single bloodshot eye stares out from
the center of the face. A palace built on mortality, it's part
lumbering Cyclops, part sly One-Eyed Jack.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the staring red, white and blue eye hangs a distinctly
phallic nose, which dangles above a ruby-red-lipped orifice. A digit
rises straight from the top of the head, while a tiny globe is
perched like a basketball on the finger's tip. The crenelated castle
wall that rings the head doubles as a crew cut.</TE>
<TE>   With hands on hips and mouth agape--a silhouetted figure can be
glimpsed inside the mouth, gesticulating wildly--this cheerfully
monstrous cartoon-figure seems ready to declaim. What is in its
heart? Open the cabinet door and two chambers inside its body are
lined with pop-bottle caps. On top, a shelf holds two toys: a
headless tin baseball player and a circus acrobat. On the shelf below
is a sinking battleship.</TE>
<TE>   Westermann wove autobiographical elements into all his work. He
was an antiaircraft machine-gunner aboard the USS Enterprise in 1945,
during attacks by Japanese kamikaze pilots, and after the war he
traveled through California, China and Japan working as an acrobat.
But you don't need to know his personal story to read the simple
symbols in Westermann's lovingly crafted memorial to Everyman. Its
soul is light and gay, but below deck things look grim.</TE>
<TE>   The retrospective is filled with works like this--feisty, funny,
heartfelt, blunt about human failings, obsessed with mortality and
generous in spirit. Many works have a toy-like quality--boats and
robots are recurrent favorites--which asserts art's role as play for
adults. Their careful craftsmanship makes them seem like gifts: "I
made this for you."</TE>
<TE>   Boxes are another subset of Westermann's work. "Untitled (Sardine
Box)" (1973) features an inlaid silhouette of a dark ship on its lid,
which is held open by a brass chain. Inside, glass-topped wooden
compartments are lined up in rows and stacked in layers. Each one
holds an opened sardine can, its own lid rolled back on a metal key,
empty like an expectant coffin.</TE>
<TE>   The allusion to death in the hold of a ship, packed in like
sardines and swimming with the fishes, is clear. The work links the
artist's memories of War World II and Korea with the then-current
horrors of Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   What's touching, though, is the listing of materials Westermann
imprinted directly into the wood, with their discreetly considered
vernacular references: "The death ship is a purple heart wood from
S[outh] A[merica]. The other inlays are pine, as is the box."
Material craft becomes a humanistic signifier of prudence, care and
thoughtful responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   There's also considerable wit and wry sexual innuendo in
Westermann's art. "Walnut Box" (1964) is a box made from, yes,
walnut, and it's filled to the brim with unshelled walnuts, too. It's
a treasure chest of nuts, deployed for their sexual punch and as a
psychological description of its maker: nuts!</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the coin, "Great Mother Womb" (1957) is a
lozenge-shaped cavity, somewhat like a boat tipped on end, amazingly
crafted from wood and raised on a pedestal. An incantatory poem is
stamped into the open wooden door, while chicken-wire glass at the
back allows radiant light inside the mysterious tunnel. It's a
flabbergasting object.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is large--about 90 sculptures--although a number of
works, several of them important, were pulled from the show by
lenders. The Geffen is a much-loved exhibition space, but it is not
climate-controlled. When MOCA decided to add the Andy Warhol
retrospective to its schedule, the Westermann show had to be moved
from the Grand Avenue building to the Geffen warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   Missing are the menacing little totem "The Evil New War God
(S.O.B.)" (1958) and the death-ship steering wheel "Antimobile"
(1965), both from the Whitney and among the artist's better-known
works. Most disappointing is the elimination of seven of the 11 bound
sketchbooks. The four that remain give some sense of Westermann's
aggressive, animated style of drawing, where he worked out the ideas
that became sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is enough here to give a full sense of Westermann's
development as an artist. It's a show not to be missed. And if you
caught Mike Kelley's exhibition last month at Patrick Painter Inc. in
Santa Monica, you'll know Westermann's relevance for major artists
today. His memorializing sculptures and Robby-the-Robot-like figures
are direct ancestors of Kelley's strange, poignant monument to
astronaut John Glenn, cobbled together from broken crockery dredged
from the Detroit River.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Billy Al Bengston, a longtime friend of Westermann,
designed the Geffen's spare installation. Its pearl gray walls,
mustard yellow floors and wood-framed window displays are given an
appropriately surprising twist: The yellow paint on the floor is
feathered at the edges where it meets the wall, creating an ethereal
yet vaguely toxic cloud of unobtrusive color.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a drawback. Several sculptures are shown on shelves or
on pedestals pushed against the walls. You cannot see them in the
round, which turns sculpture into graphic design and unnecessarily
limits our experience.</TE>
<TE>   Take "They Couldn't Put Humpty-Dumpty Back Together Again" (1980),
a monumental tic-tac-toe board of exquisitely crafted exotic woods
and one of Westermann's final works. He placed the three Xs and two
O's on the game board's grid in a pattern that lets you know that, no
matter what your next move, you lose. More than a simple graphic
marker, it's a lovingly crafted material object whose physical
presence redeems our fate.</TE>

<LD>   New Winfrey Program to Be Shown on Oxygen</LD>
<LD>   Oprah Winfrey will star in a prime-time coda to her daytime talk
show on the Oxygen cable channel, of which she's a 25% owner.</LD>
<TE>   "Oprah After the Show," which begins Sept. 16, will be taped each
day when Winfrey finishes her syndicated talk show. It will air
weeknights at 7:30 p.m., with reruns at 10 p.m., 11:30 p.m. and 8:30
a.m. the next day.</TE>
<TE>   The show could be a lucrative one for Winfrey, whose media empire,
Harpo Inc., is already valued at nearly $1 billion. As part of her
1998 investment in Oxygen, she agreed to give the network exclusive
rights to reruns of her talk show, which were to begin this fall--a
deal, she told Fortune magazine, she has come to regret. By accepting
this replacement, Oxygen is giving up those rights, says Geraldine
Laybourne, Oxygen chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   The network, available in about 41 million of the nation's 105
million TV homes, hopes that viewers interested in the show will
pressure cable systems to carry Oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   PBS Anchor Dhaliwal Heads to CNN</TE>
<TE>   Daljit Dhaliwal, who's developed something of a cult following as
the anchor of a world news program shown on many PBS stations, is
jumping to CNN.</TE>
<TE>   At least for the time being, though, audiences in the United
States won't be able to see her.</TE>
<TE>   She will begin working for CNN International in Atlanta as anchor
of the network's "World News" and "World Report" programs. Both are
seen overseas but not on the U.S. network.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Top Film Romances Honored by AFI</TE>
<TE>   The American Film Institute's list of top 100 U.S. screen
romances, announced on a special on CBS Tuesday night, dredged up
some of the big-screen classics.</TE>
<TE>   "Casablanca" (1942) led the pack, followed by "Gone With the Wind"
(1939), "West Side Story" (1961), "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "An
Affair to Remember" (1957 ). "The Way We Were" (1973), "Doctor
Zhivago" (1965), "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946), "Love Story" (1970),
and "City Lights" (1931) rounded out the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   The mix also contained its share of surprises: "King Kong" was No.
24, "Beauty and the Beast" No. 34 and "Lady and the Tramp" No. 95.
And edging out "Pillow Talk" and "Jerry Maguire," "The Hunchback of
Notre Dame" took the 98th spot.</TE>
<TE>   Bergman Donates to Swedish Film Archive</TE>
<TE>   The Swedish Film Institute has received about 45 crates from
director Ingmar Bergman, filled with behind-the-scenes footage,
photographs, sketches and manuscripts.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very rare that you find an artist of international
significance who has documented his own life in the way that Bergman
has," Aase Kleveland, director general of the film institute, told
reporters. "He has not thrown away one piece of paper during his
83-year-old life."</TE>
<TE>   The Stockholm-based archive will help researchers study the
"thought processes" that went into Bergman's work, a spokesman for
the institute said. They haven't yet decided to what extent the
material will be available to the public.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Permit for Concert by Grateful Dead Is Denied</TE>
<TE>   A Milwaukee county highway committee denied a permit to the
promoters of a Grateful Dead reunion concert Tuesday, saying the area
could not handle the enormous crowd expected.</TE>
<TE>   "You can imagine the amount of humanity that's going to converge
on little old East Troy in Walworth County," said committee Chairman
Odell R. Gigante. "We only have 80-some sheriff deputies. Short of
bringing in the National Guard, we just couldn't handle it."</TE>
<TE>   The Aug. 3-4 concert would have been the first time Mickey Hart,
Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir staged a concert together
since the death of Jerry Garcia, the Dead's leader and founder.
Garcia died in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Promoter Clear Channel can appeal.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Peter Gabriel has married his Irish girlfriend Meah Flynn on the
island of Sardinia, the BBC reports....Johnny Depp has agreed to star
in two upcoming Jerry Bruckheimer films: "The Pirates of the
Caribbean," a film based on the Disney theme park ride, and
"Takedown," playing a U.S. marshal in search of an assassin....Warner
Bros. will produce a new feature film, "Looney Tunes: Back in
Action," with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird and the Tasmanian
Devil. Brendan Fraser will star alongside them in the mix of live
action and animation, to be directed by Joe Dante...."A.I.:
Artificial Intelligence" walked off with five prizes, including best
sci-fi film, at the 28th annual Saturn Awards Monday night--an event
honoring the best in the science-fiction, horror and fantasy in film
and TV. "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" won
three, including best fantasy film. "The Others" won for best horror
film.... Universal Home Video will issue a two-disc DVD set of "E.T.
The Extra-Terrestrial," featuring both the 2002 theatrical version
and the original, for 10 weeks only, beginning Oct. 22....
Choreographer Michael Kidd and cast members Julie Newmar, Russ
Tamblyn, Ruta Lee, Tommy Rall and, schedule permitting, Howard Keel
will reunite for a program preceding a screening of "Seven Brides for
Seven Brothers" at the Los Angeles Conservancy's Last Remaining Seats
series tonight at 8 at the Orpheum, 842 S. Broadway, downtown L.A.</TE>

<HD>Cerritos: New Bastion of High Art for Middle Class</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tidy middle-class enclave of Cerritos is quietly creating a new
role for itself: patron of the arts. The suburban Medicis of Cerritos
are investing heavily in art and culture--even commissioning
music--and doing it all in the birthplace of auto malls and freeway
buffer walls.</LD>
<LD>   City officials call it a social work in progress.</LD>
<LD>   Signs of the creative surge are most evident at the intersection
of Bloomfield Avenue and 183rd Street near City Hall. On one corner
stands a new $35-million library with iridescent titanium skin.
Across the street, in the shadow of the city-owned and -operated
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, Cerritos officials plan to
build an art museum. Nearby Heritage Park is being transformed with
deepened lakes, a replica of an American Colonial village and a
12-foot-tall bronze of Paul Revere on horseback.</LD>
<TE>   There's more.</TE>
<TE>   The city, gearing up for a 10th anniversary tribute to the
performing arts center, plans to commission orchestral pieces from
film and television composer Lalo Schifrin, perhaps best known for
the theme to "Mission: Impossible." It also is considering
commissioning a symphonic work that would incorporate a dance
accompaniment, preferably performed by tap-dancer Gregory Hines, a
regular center performer.</TE>
<TE>   In a built-out city where sales taxes make up about one-third of
the $71.1-million annual budget, officials say spending on public art
and splashy buildings helps maintain the quality of life, celebrates
the diversity of its 53,000 residents and attracts new business.</TE>
<TE>   Seated at a gleaming titanium table in one of the library's study
rooms, Councilman Robert Hughlett, a driving force behind the
project, noted: "A lot of what you see around here is ostentatious.
But there's a teachable moment in every stitch of it."</TE>
<TE>   One floor below him is a 40-foot-long model of a Tyrannosaurus rex
skeleton, posed a few feet from a 15,000-gallon aquarium stocked with
five sharks and dozens of marine species--all of which can be viewed
via closed-circuit TV on computers throughout the library.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Jim Nardini of the Glendale firm Charles Walton and
Associates, the lavish Millennium Library houses 200 computer
terminals and 300,000 volumes. Non-city residents must pay $100 to
get a library card.</TE>
<TE>   "We want our city to be the best possible for our residents, so
we're making it sparkle more, in carefully considered ways," Hughlett
said. "We've already invested heavily in education. Art and culture
seems the next logical phase."</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos is not the only city investing in architecture and art to
boost what some call the "livability index." Tracy, Merced, Santa Ana
and Laguna Beach among others have integrated art into their
communities.</TE>
<TE>   But the scale of projects in Cerritos sets it apart. In fact, what
impresses newcomers is how an atmosphere of order and quality
permeates everyday life in the tightly zoned 8.9-square-mile
community that, to outsiders, is often remembered as the site of the
1986 Aeromexico crash that killed 82 people.</TE>
<TE>   Cobblestone walks are lined with neatly trimmed trees,
neighborhoods crisscrossed with freshly paved streets. Industrial
parks are unblemished by graffiti. In a region devoted to the car,
Cerritos has allowed only one drive-through restaurant, though it
will allow a second one, a Krispy Kreme, this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Cerritos is an anomaly in terms of successful Southern California
cities," said Dan Barber, professor of public policy and
administration at Cal State Long Beach. "It has no ocean, mountains
or Queen Mary--it's just a spot on the map. But outsiders come into
town, notice all the trees, clean streets, public art, fountains, low
crime and general good mood, and they start firing up the credit
cards.</TE>
<TE>   "Cerritos could have been more assertive in terms of trying to
diversify its community with more low- and moderate-income housing,"
he added. "But then, they've got no room left." Indeed, the library
was built on the foundation of the city's first library. Its
8,000-square-foot art museum--by Los Angeles-based Frederick Fisher &amp;
Partners, which also designed a $5.6-million expansion of the Long
Beach Museum of Art--will be built in a former downtown medical
center.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage of space has not diminished City Manager Art
Gallucci's dreams of transforming the town, located 10 miles north of
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for a niche; it could be music," Gallucci said. "I
want to take the Center for Performing Arts to a higher level."</TE>
<TE>   For the 2002-03 season, Gallucci increased the number of
productions over the previous year from 153 to 200, an ambitious
schedule for an 1,800-seat facility. He recently hired Craig
Springer, former assistant dean of cultural arts at USC, to run the
place.</TE>
<TE>   The center receives $3.5 million a year in city subsidies and is
considered one of six city departments. Although it receives some
funds from a boosters group, it is largely a city operation, and
center workers are considered employees of Cerritos. Gallucci
routinely runs the season schedule past the City Council, but the
tone of the season is set by Springer.</TE>
<TE>   Among Springer's responsibilities is organizing the 10th
anniversary celebration at the $60-million center, which enjoyed
record ticket sales of nearly $7 million this season. Ticket sales
the previous season were $5.8 million, and officials suggest that the
center's mainstream mix--from Clint Black to Kathleen Battle to the
Royal Shakespeare Company--helps account for the increase. Among the
featured guests for the anniversary will be Frank Sinatra Jr., whose
father performed there when the center opened in January 1993.</TE>
<TE>   For some of the performers, the center has many virtues, from its
intimacy to the efficiency of its sound technicians and stagehands.
"From the time you arrive, it's like getting on board the Queen
Elizabeth II ocean liner," said dancer Hines. "It's a kind of a plush
[place]--you can actually relax ... so there's no stress before a
show."</TE>
<TE>   A day after performing to a packed house, guitarist Christopher
Parkening praised the hall's warm treatment of sound. "From the
stage, the acoustics are such that they allow a soloist to hear their
sounds returning to them," he said. "It inspires you to play better,
to linger on phrases and high notes."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of enthusiasm is rampant in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Even before work started on the $5-million art museum, some
officials floated the idea of exhibiting some of the ancient terra
cotta warrior figures unearthed in China. "It'd be great to have some
of those warriors as a centerpiece," Councilman Hughlett said.</TE>
<TE>   City Engineer Erin Alvarez strode up a hill at Heritage Park--the
town's main recreation area--where push-button water cannons were
installed recently to let children splash one another from opposite
sides of a lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Cerritos has a beautiful philosophy of improvement, and I love
it," she said. "It's all about creating and preserving a higher
standard of living in a remarkably ethnically diverse community."</TE>
<TE>   And, some would say, that adds flavor to many of the recent
investments in the city that is 44% Asian, 35.8% white, 12.5% Latino
and 7.2% African American.</TE>
<TE>   Take the gold panels and discs attached to a wall at the end of
some book stacks in the library. The words "light, energy,
information" are embossed on the work by artist Lita Albuquerque in
Braille and several languages, including Spanish, Korean and Hindi.</TE>
<TE>   When the library opened in March to a first-day crowd of about
8,000 adults and children, it was easy to forget that Cerritos once
had more dairy cows than people.</TE>
<TE>   That was in the 1960s, when the notion of building a
master-planned community, shopping malls and an auto center on
pastures hemmed in by freeways and grimy industrial parks seemed
brainy, but risky.</TE>
<TE>   It was right on the money.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a new five-member fine arts and historical commission
appointed by the City Council is trying to fulfill its mission of
"creating a cultural legacy," chiefly by advising the council on
purchasing sculpture and other public art.</TE>
<TE>   "Investing in art brings civic pride, helps real estate values and
attracts tourism and high-end businesses," said Paul Minicucci,
deputy director of the California Arts Council. "For small towns in
competitive settings, it says, 'Hey, relocate here. We care about
culture and children's futures.' "</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>A.S.K. Theater Projects--one of L.A.'s most prominent benefactors of
new plays and other theatrical work--is undergoing changes that have
left some L.A. theater artists concerned about its future and
commitment to the community.</LD>
<LD>   Founded in 1989 and funded from the personal fortune of its
founders, Audrey Skirball-Kenis (for whom the group is named) and her
husband, Charles Kenis, A.S.K. is known nationally for its programs
that nourish playwrights and new works, including its Common Ground
Festival of new plays, writers' retreats and workshops, as well as
educational outreach programs, such as the Playwrights in the Schools
program. The nonprofit organization, with an annual budget of nearly
$2 million, has served as a key donor to such institutions as Center
Theatre Group, CalArts' playwriting program and the "Hot Properties"
series at the Ford Amphitheatre.</LD>
<LD>   But many artists have expressed fears that A.S.K. is focusing more
on larger theaters and projects away from the city in part because of
the elimination of the group's literary department, the cancellation
or scaling back of programs and a shift in its stated mission.</LD>
<TE>   This year's Common Ground Festival, June 22 and 23 at UCLA, will
feature admission-free workshop performances by three Los
Angeles-based artists or groups--Janie Geiser, Critical Mass and
Tongue, as well as companies from San Diego, San Francisco and
Chicago. That's three fewer groups than last year's roster, although
the groups are receiving more money this year--$10,000 to $15,000
each. Executive Director Kym Eisner said that's in keeping with her
intent for A.S.K. programs to be "deeper, and maybe not so wide."</TE>
<TE>   But that's what worries the local theater community. "There's a
buzz nationwide in the field of new play development," said Mark
Taper Forum dramaturge John Glore. "There's curiosity and concern
about [whether] this is signaling some sea change at A.S.K. and how
it will impact the field."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the shrinking of the staff from 11 to 7, the organization
has canceled this fall's New Play Weekends program of readings, held
annually since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "A.S.K.'s strength is its breadth," said Bart DeLorenzo, artistic
director of the Evidence Room, a producer of cutting-edge works. "It
has been extraordinary because it reached out to such a large variety
of people and styles."</TE>
<TE>   Wendy McClellan, A.S.K.'s former general manager, said the
organization "always had a direct link to the artists, and the staff
was key to that." Yet, from the changes so far, she observed "it
feels like it might be getting rid of programming and just giving
grants to organizations. I don't understand how that's unique. That's
what every foundation does."</TE>
<TE>   The organization also "was looked to as a home for local artists,"
McClellan said. Now, she said, it appears that A.S.K. is "much more
interested in looking outside L.A."</TE>
<TE>   A.S.K. used to identify itself as "a local and national resource
for the theater and its artists, facilitating the creation of new
work through a broad range of artistic and educational programs."
Now, the words "local," "national" and "broad" are gone from its
mission statement. The new statement says A.S.K. "is committed to the
development of new work for the American stage. Central to its work
is an institutional belief in the value of the collaborative
process.... "</TE>
<TE>   "We're not abandoning the local community," Eisner said, noting
that the absence of "local" in the new mission "wasn't a conscious
decision." The statement also dropped "national" and doesn't mention
"international," she said, even though A.S.K. supports the Royal
Court Theatre in London.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner said the organization is going through a period of intense
evaluation of its programming. Some programs may be dropped, she
said, but evaluations of only a little more than half of the 22
programs have been completed.</TE>
<TE>   The assessment began last fall. Independent consultants Danton
Miller and Cora Mirkitani conducted a general assessment and saw "an
organization with a deep commitment to new work," Eisner said, "but
one that needed a deeper understanding of how you move things
forward, who you report to for what. We were sending mixed messages."</TE>
<TE>   In March, after completion of the assessment, the director of
literary programs, Mead Hunter, left A.S.K. Eisner said Hunter wanted
to do something different with his career. Hunter said that he did
not leave voluntarily, but he declined to discuss the details.
Hunter's primary assistant, literary manager Matt Almos, also left.
"The direction of the organization and my artistic career were at
odds," Almos said, declining to be more specific.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter and Almos have not been replaced. "I do plan to have a
programming staff," Eisner said. "But I can't bring in someone now if
the programs are going to change in five months." No one is
soliciting scripts for the group, she said, but a staff member is
tracking the scripts that are submitted (A.S.K. receives about 400
each year).</TE>
<TE>   The New Play Weekends were canceled two weeks ago because "we
realized we're low on staff," Eisner said. The cancellation may apply
only to this year, but she added that "there are a lot of good
readings programs," citing those at South Coast Repertory and the
A.S.K.-funded Mark Taper Forum New Work Festival--"both of which
offer more opportunities to be produced.... Maybe we can fill a
different hole."</TE>
<TE>   Monologuist Sandra Tsing Loh, who participated in A.S.K.'s Common
Ground Festival last year, cited the relatively high pay for artists
in A.S.K. programs as one of the organization's most appealing
aspects. "In L.A.," she said, "there are ample opportunities to do
edgy stuff and be paid nothing. But as non-mainstream as A.S.K.'s
taste is, they're fairly well-funded." Loh was paid $4,000 (which she
shared with her director) for doing two performances. She said this
is more than she was paid for similar work in the Mark Taper Forum's
New Work Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner cited one new A.S.K. program that will give writers a
better opportunity to be produced--a co-commissioning of plays from
writers in conjunction with established theaters. The first such
grant is to David Rambo and is being shared with the Geffen
Playhouse, which produced the playwright's "God's Man in Texas"
earlier this year. She hopes to extend this idea elsewhere. But it's
hardly unique--the Taper and the James Irvine Foundation have
currently co-commissioned seven plays.</TE>
<TE>   Such moves, Eisner said, do not mean A.S.K. will become another
foundation that will work primarily with large organizations instead
of artists. "We are looking at more funding partnerships and
collaborations, but we have no intention to direct them all to
well-established theaters. Lincoln Center or some place in
Burbank--they're all possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   She also said the organizations must be "artist-centered." A.S.K.
will remain hands-on with artists, she said. "We will create
guidelines for them--but based on their needs, not ours."</TE>
<TE>   "Hands-on" is open to interpretation, however.</TE>
<TE>   In A.S.K's largest new initiative of the past year, it announced a
"New Plays/New Ways" program in November, giving $100,000 over three
years to each of four theater companies outside California: ACT in
Seattle, Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis, McCarter Theatre
Center in Princeton, N.J., and Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington,
D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Cuts in staff could make "hands-on" work more difficult. Charles
Kenis said he thought the previous A.S.K. staff was "too big" but
added that the changes have nothing to do with saving money. When
asked about the consultants who assessed A.S.K., he said he had not
talked to them. One of the consultants, Miller--whose full-time job
has been special assistant to the president of Otis College of Art
and Design--was recently hired as A.S.K. managing director. Beginning
in July, he will manage the business side of the organization and
will not oversee programs, Eisner said.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner hopes the organization's board will be expanded. It
consists of only Skirball-Kenis, the driving force behind the
formation of the organization; her husband; and Eisner. The couple
are noted patrons of the arts. Skirball-Kenis is the daughter of a
wealthy New York banker who later married Jack Skirball, a film
producer and real estate magnate. Charles Kenis derived his fortune
from Bel-Air Imports. Eisner started at A.S.K. as an intern in
February 1994, joined the staff in June and became executive director
in 1995. (Skirball-Kenis was not available for comment and her
husband denied speculation that she has been ill.) The organization
is funded by the larger, New York-based Skirball Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The feelings expressed on the local theatrical grapevine about
A.S.K. caught Eisner by surprise. "I was not aware of the sense of
ownership the community feels, until the last couple of months."</TE>
<TE>   "We never were local," Kenis said. "We've always been involved
nationally." However, he said to tell local artists "not to be
concerned."</TE>

<LD>Eight years ago today, at 11:45 p.m., O.J. Simpson's flight from L.A.
to Chicago was cleared for takeoff. Less than a half-hour later, the
bodies of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman were
found.</LD>
<LD>   Simpson, of course, would be on a flight from the law days later,
crouched in the back of his white Ford Bronco as friend Al Cowlings
drove, the infamous police pursuit etching itself in the memories of
millions on June 17, 1994.</LD>
<LD>   "Minute by Minute" (10 p.m. A&amp;E), a documentary series that
reconstructs news events through eyewitness accounts, tries to take a
fresh, dramatic look at the chase and its effects tonight. But too
often it comes across as a rehashing of overly familiar material, and
a second-rate one at that.</LD>
<TE>   The title is a bit of a misnomer because the show is hardly a
minutely detailed account. Understandably, it condenses events into
highlights, giving snapshots of, say, the tactics of law enforcement
at a given point or the thoughts of Nicole's sister Denise when O.J.
Simpson threatened suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Far less understandable are factual inaccuracies and the uneven if
not misleading use of news footage, reenactments, still photos and
interviews. Sometimes, the blunders are innocuous, such as visuals
that don't quite match the script. At other times, they undermine the
show's credibility: Early on, the program states that LAPD officers
"discovered" the victims' bodies, making no mention of the fact they
were initially found by neighbors. And beyond that, how much can you
trust a documentary that recycles the same video clips to illustrate
different moments in the chase?</TE>
<TE>   Last week's "Minute by Minute," about Dr. Jerri Nielsen battling
her own cancer while stuck at the South Pole in 1999, was far better
constructed. But tonight, as with many things pertaining to the
Simpson case, what you see is not necessarily what you get.</TE>

<HD>Camp Is a Lifesaver for Tammy, 15, Born With HIV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KWALA MANDEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifteen-year-old Tammy left a short but telling message in an
Internet chat room: "If it wasn't for camp, I would have committed
suicide."</LD>
<LD>   Tammy, who did not want her last name used, was born with the
virus that causes AIDS, a disease which she can only discuss with a
few close friends at the school she attends in Paramount. For the
last seven summers, Camp Laurel, for children diagnosed with AIDS or
HIV, has given Tammy a place to leave the secrecy behind. In a
youthful and clearly chipper voice, Tammy explains why she left that
message.</LD>
<LD>   "If I had never gone to camp, I wouldn't be so positive," she
says. "My mom telling me things will be OK is not the same as hearing
it from someone who's been through the same thing."</LD>
<TE>   Although her 33-year-old mother has AIDS, Tammy says that because
she is older, she doesn't always know what the experience is like
from a teenager's perspective. Her mother, who works for an AIDS
foundation, contracted the virus through a blood transfusion she
received when she was pregnant with Tammy in Mexico. She learned she
was HIV-positive five years later when her husband became ill. The
doctors didn't know what was wrong. "AIDS was the last thing that
occurred to them. They finally tested him and he had it," says Tammy.
Her father's diagnosis was followed by her mother's. When Tammy was
5, her father died and she and her mother moved to California. "Then
I found out I had it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom explained it like a storybook. She said there was a worm
living inside us--that was like the virus," says Tammy. "She said it
didn't harm us, but it was still there."</TE>
<TE>   Like her mother, the HIV virus has developed into AIDS in Tammy.
Margot Andrew, executive director of the Camp Laurel Foundation,
says, "She does take medication all the time, and typically with
kids, you can't really tell they are sick."</TE>
<TE>   Now Tammy helps others understand AIDS, both at camp and by
speaking at conferences with her mother. Andrew calls her a role
model at the Big Bear camp. "She's the one looking around the
campfire who will notice if a camper is cold and offer her a coat.
She'll notice before a counselor."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Tammy will be one of 16 children enjoying camp thanks
to donations to the Los Angeles Times summer camp campaign. She will
participate in the Teen Adventure program for 13- to 16-year-olds. It
includes a segment called "Chill Chat Groups," which deals with
issues of dating. Andrew says the campers learn how to tell a
boyfriend or girlfriend about their condition, and other frustrations
they may face as a teen with AIDS or HIV.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about how it is living with AIDS, and how kids at school
talk about it and joke, but we feel bad," says Tammy. "They shouldn't
be saying those things, but we can't say anything."</TE>
<TE>   For some of the new campers, there is a brief, awkward transition
when they arrive because they tend to have two lives, according to
Andrew. "One is school life, where they have to pretend, and the
other is home life, where they are sick and taking their
medications." At camp, they don't immediately know which persona to
adopt. The camp counters this through an environment where issues are
openly discussed, and medications openly taken.</TE>
<TE>   "Many are taking 20 pills, three times a day. Some might be on IVs
or in wheelchairs, but it's not a big deal," says Andrew. "At meals,
the medical staff comes out and the kids are cracking jokes at the
table. They take their medication, and go back to cracking jokes."</TE>
<TE>   The camp tries to give the children the opportunity to test their
own boundaries. Andrew recalls a child who was in a wheelchair and
paralyzed from the waist down. The child said he wanted to try an
exercise that required climbing up a pole to reach a platform and
then grabbing onto a trapeze. He used only his arms to climb up and
successfully push off to grab the trapeze.</TE>
<TE>   "We teach self-esteem and encourage them to try activities they
didn't think they could do," says Andrew. "It is about self-worth and
trust. We show them fun, that life can be great."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call (213) 237-5771. To make credit card
donations, visit www.la times.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The camp campaign
is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick
Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<LD>   Otto the Auto is a robotic car that visits classes throughout
Southern California, free of charge. Otto teaches children about
traffic safety through songs, blinking headlights and friendly
presentations in English and Spanish. Today he talks to Destanie
about playing outdoors after dinner.</LD>
<LD>   Destanie had just finished helping her mom and dad with the dinner
dishes when she went outside to play for a short time. The
neighborhood children had agreed to gather on Destanie's lawn for a
game of hide-and-seek. While she waited for everyone to arrive, her
friend Otto the Auto drove by.</LD>
<TE>   "Hi, Otto," Destanie called. "Do you want to play hide-and-seek
with me and my friends? I know all the best hiding places."</TE>
<TE>   "That sounds like fun," Otto answered. "But you must always be
careful when you play outside after dinner, because even though it
stays light later, it is dangerous because sometimes drivers can't
see you as well when it starts getting dark."</TE>
<TE>   "My mom and dad talked with me about that already," Destanie said.
"They say that I should always wear light-colored clothes, and they
bought me shoes that have special strips that reflect light."</TE>
<TE>   "Those are very safe," Otto said. "A lot of children have shoes
that flash lights when they walk. Not only are they fun, but they
really help drivers see you. Another thing to remember is to carry a
flashlight."</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good tip," Destanie said. "Because it may be light when
I go outside, but when I come home it will be darker."</TE>
<TE>   "You're right, Destanie," Otto said. "When playing hide-and-seek
you don't want the other children to find you, but now you know how
important it is that drivers see you."</TE>
<TE>   Visit Otto's Web site at www.aaa-calif.com/otto for parent and
teacher information and fun activities for kids. Principals can
arrange for Otto to visit schools by contacting the Automobile Club
of Southern California at (714) 885-2317.</TE>

<LD>"Henry and Ribsy"</LD>
<LD>   by Beverly Cleary</LD>
<LD>   Henry Huggins wanted to go salmon fishing with his father. He
hoped to catch a large Chinook salmon. Mr. Huggins said he would take
Henry fishing if he could keep Ribsy, their dog, out of trouble. It
was hard for Henry to watch Ribsy every minute, but he tried. Ribsy
still growled at the garbage collector and upset the ladies in the
PTA. They thought Ribsy chased and scared Ramona, Beezus' little
sister.</LD>
<TE>   Can Ribsy stay out of trouble? How will Henry get to go fishing
with his father and catch a salmon? Will Ribsy have to stay behind if
Henry goes fishing? Read the book to find out!</TE>

<HD>Royal Frump and Circumstance</HD>
<DH>Queen Elizabeth's dowdy style sense is her crowning glory</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN GIVHAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Queen Elizabeth II seems to revel in her frumpiness, which, of
course, only makes it more splendid.</LD>
<LD>   Those figure-ignoring suits, the prim gloves and the church-mum
hats have been on full, glorious display these last few days as she
has celebrated her Golden Jubilee.</LD>
<LD>   From stages, steps and the Gold State Coach, the queen has
executed that marvelous royal wave in which the hand swings to and
fro like a sail in a gentle breeze. That silent greeting has been
copied by beauty queens around the world, but none can execute it
with the stately panache of the queen. As she has posed for
photographs with her subjects, both the famous and the unknown, she
has produced the same tight smile that never varies in breadth by
more than a millimeter.</LD>
<TE>   And at virtually every occasion, she has toted around a
pocketbook. Were it something a bit more chic such as a Marc Jacobs
satchel or a fringed Carlos Falchi hobo sack, one would be inclined
to refer to it as a handbag. But her little black patent-leather tote
is so perfectly frumpy, so delightfully bubbe, that it can only be
called a pocketbook.</TE>
<TE>   Its omnipresence leads one to wonder what it could possibly
contain, as it's highly unlikely that the queen would need to carry
around a driver's license, a cell phone or one of those collapsible
Totes umbrellas. Because the queen is so grandmotherly in her public
presentation--even in the way her unruly family seems to snap to
under her steely gaze--one suspects that the monarch is doing what
any well-prepared granny would and stocking her pocketbook with
nibbles in case anyone should get hungry before supper. Undoubtedly,
there are Starlight peppermints wrapped in clear plastic and stuffed
into the bottom of that bag.</TE>
<TE>   As with any public person, the queen's style has often been
unkindly remarked upon. Within the fashion industry, the queen was
often pointed to as a source of inspiration during the height of the
'90s' dowdy-chic phase and its fascination with dull blouses and
skirts of unflattering length. But complaints about the queen's sense
of style have always been uttered with an amused shrug. No one
expected the queen to change her wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   Why should she? At 76, she has perfected her look. She has honed a
personal style that, in its exquisitely articulated dowdiness, speaks
of solidity, continuity, ritual and timelessness.</TE>
<TE>   Her attire is obviously and loudly of another era, although it is
impossible to say which one. She dresses in a manner that announces
she is different from other, lesser folks who are constrained by
their times. She--an embodiment of the monarchy--is as timeless as a
rock.</TE>
<TE>   Dowdiness is defined by its relationship to time. A dowdy dresser
is one who fails to move forward, who clings to dirndls when everyone
else long ago moved on to pencil skirts and trousers.</TE>
<TE>   One is reminded of this by the queen's dress gloves, by the hats
that sit atop her head with such stubborn formality. The silver hair
has been painstakingly sculpted into a complex cross between an Aqua
Net bouffant and a barrister's powdered wig. Utterly divorced from
the here and now, her coiffure is eloquently arcane.</TE>
<TE>   Her bosom--not a bust or a chest, mind you--is always neatly
swaddled in fabric or jewels. She has favored pearls during much of
the Jubilee celebration. And such modesty is what one would expect
for a woman of her years. But one can imagine her old-fashioned
explanation for this conservative cover-up: "Gracious, dear, one must
keep the chill out."</TE>

<LD>Riley, his best friend, Sam, his sister, Wendy, and their dad arrived
at the department store to spend Riley's gift certificate. "Where can
I find the perfect gift for $30?" he asked.</LD>
<LD>   "In the toy department," Sam said. "You gotta get a toy. You only
got a stupid plaid shirt and pants for your other presents." Riley
watched his father's chest heave in anger under his plaid shirt.</LD>
<LD>   "But it was a great shirt. It matches my dad's," Riley said. "But
now I want a toy." When they got to the toy department, Riley said,
"I see about 2,327 things I want. Like this Silver Saber Sword."</LD>
<TE>   "But it costs $79.95. You only have $30," said Riley's father.</TE>
<TE>   "Buy this!" Wendy said. "We can play music on it."</TE>
<TE>   "Riley, man," Sam sneered. "You can't get that dopey cassette
player. It's got bunnies on it."</TE>
<TE>   "Please!" Wendy said. "Pretty music!"</TE>
<TE>   "C'mon dude," Sam said. "Purple bunnies."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we should take this gift certificate over to the boy's
department so that we can buy another set of birthday shirts and
pants," said Riley's father, steaming.</TE>
<TE>   Riley was really upset.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will Riley get to buy a toy or more clothes? Or will he
end up with the cassette recorder?</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Johnson's most recent book, "We Play Music," was published
this spring by Lee &amp; Low Books Inc. This story will be on The Times'
Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<DH>Superstitious fans assist the Lakers with rituals, lucky
items</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>When the Lakers lost the two playoff games that super-fan Caleb
Osborne had videotaped, superstition set in. All taping stopped at
his house. Not only that, he refused to watch a game in any room
where it was being recorded.</LD>
<LD>   "It would have been bad luck," said the Orange resident, who dons
Laker shorts, jersey, warmups and his special good luck hard hat for
games.</LD>
<LD>   When radio personality Matt Smith was selecting his garb for the
first game of the NBA championship series, it didn't take him long to
decide what to wear: a Sparks jersey. He'd worn the women's league
shirt in the last two games of the Lakers' semifinal series against
the Sacramento Kings. Clearly, the magic of the jersey had propelled
the Lakers to victory.</LD>
<TE>   Nine-year-old Dylan McCarthy of Santa Monica helps out his Lakers
when they're in trouble by fixating on a single player as he watches
the game on TV; usually, it's Kobe Bryant or Shaquille O'Neal. He
says the results are almost always good. "When I stare at Kobe or
Shaq, they usually make a three-pointer or a slam-dunk," said Dylan.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the radio caller who bemoaned his role in a Laker
loss to the Kings. His crime? He left his lucky Laker cup sitting in
the dishwasher unused while he was watching the game.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the variety of sports superstitions and good-luck charms,
which especially come to the fore when championships are on the line.
Out come the lucky T-shirts and jerseys. Baseball caps are turned at
a certain angle. Superstitious fans who positioned themselves on the
sofa for last year's win plant themselves in the same place this time
around.</TE>
<TE>   While fans profess the powers of all manner of good luck
paraphernalia, the most common are jerseys and hats, though some are
hardly garden variety. For Game 3 of the championship series on
Sunday night, 21-year-old Karina Ruvalcaba wore a lucky hat to Yankee
Doodles sports bar in Long Beach. The ornate headdress was fashioned
only that afternoon at a local chili cook-off. So did it bring her
luck? "Everything will bring good luck as long as I'm cheering for
them," said Ruvalcaba, a housing counselor.</TE>
<TE>   People even return to sports bars abandoned in the interim, not
necessarily because they had such a great time there, but because
that's where they were when the team made its previous championship
run. "Now that we're in the finals, we're getting a lot of the people
we haven't seen since last year's games," said Jeff Miles, a manager
at the Burbank Bar and Grille, which caters to the sporting crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, something is working. The Lakers have all but toyed with
the New Jersey Nets for the first three games and are poised to
capture the NBA title tonight in a sweep. And even if they don't win
tonight, no team in NBA history has won the first three games and
gone on to lose the championship. So who knows what role all those
little rituals and crazy hats might have played?</TE>
<TE>   Superstition, of course, is not just for sports fans. Most people
learn from childhood that black cats and walking under ladders bring
bad luck, and don't even mention broken mirrors. But sports fans have
a spot high in the pecking order of the superstitious because of the
lengths they are willing to go to give their teams an edge.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, the fans that once arrived at the Burbank Bar
and Grille, decorating an entire section of the place with Wheaties
boxes that sported images of favorite players. And that's just for
starters. "They littered the table with every possible collectible
for their teams," said Miles.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Meyers, a Los Angeles lawyer whose office is filled with
sports memorabilia, grew up in the shadow of Chicago's Wrigley Field
and is a die-hard Cubs fan. He tapes every game he can't see in real
time. But he won't read the paper or listen to the radio until he's
actually seen the game. "I think that if I know the score, it will
change the likelihood that the Cubs will win," said Meyers, deadpan.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same person who, as a boy, wore the same socks and
underwear for more than a month--much to his mother's dismay--when he
was in the middle of a baseball hitting streak. "I'd be wearing them
to this day, but I went into a batting slump," said Meyers.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Burke, the coordinator of the sports psychology graduate
program at Georgia Southern University, believes sports superstitions
by fans are about empowerment, especially by those who are watching
on television rather than in person. Hence, if a certain kind of
potato chip is served when a team wins, it's Pringles for life. "It's
another way of wanting to take control of our world," said Burke.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to distinguish between rituals and superstitions,
Burke said. Bouncing a basketball the same number of times at the
free-throw line is a ritual that gets a player ready to shoot.
Superstitions are things players and fans feel they must do to affect
the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "A player controls ritual, whereas a superstition will control the
player," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all sports have superstitions, and not just among the fans.
In the rodeo world, for instance, wearing anything yellow is taboo,
and putting the right foot in a stirrup first is a must. Fishermen
hold to the superstition that they won't have a great outing if a
barefoot woman passes in front of them on the way to the dock. Hockey
players tap the goalie's shins for good luck.</TE>
<TE>   But no sport has more superstitions than baseball, where players
have an array of beliefs and taboos, such as not stepping on the
white chalk foul lines.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his professional basketball career, Michael Jordan
always has worn his University of North Carolina shorts under his
Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards uniforms. Philadelphia Phillies
pitcher Turk Wendell brushes his teeth and chews licorice between
every inning. Former baseball star Wade Boggs would eat only chicken
on game day. Golfing great Jack Nicklaus always carries three pennies
with him during competition. And he always puts the tail side up when
marking his ball on the green. And perhaps the kookiest was Detroit
pitcher Mark "The Bird" Fidrych, who used to get down on his hands
and knees on the mound, then talk to both himself and the ball before
he pitched.</TE>
<TE>   So the jerseys and other lucky items have been worn in a big way
during the series with the Nets. Osborne, the super fan, will have a
Lakers championship banner and a large broom hanging from his
flagpole this evening.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll help us sweep," he said.</TE>

<HD>At This School, 'It' Is a Touchy Subject</HD>
<DH>Franklin principal defends the decision to ban tag at lunch
recess, saying it has caused injuries. But many blame political
correctness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For now, Pat Samarge is "it."</LD>
<LD>   The principal of Franklin Elementary School in Santa Monica became
"it" when she banned the children's game of tag--for reasons that
included issues of self-esteem--from the playground late last month.</LD>
<LD>   To critics, Samarge is the latest example of political correctness
run even more amok than usual in a city sometimes referred to as "The
People's Republic," for its reputation of excessive governmental
regulation and bleeding-heart attitudes.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the kind of foolishness that makes wonderful grist for
the talk-show circuit," wrote Tamara Silver whose son is a
fifth-grader at Franklin in an e-mail to Samarge. "Take it from
someone who was teased mercilessly about her name, was overweight as
a child and low on everybody's birthday invite list--I would have
given my eyeteeth to be included in a game of tag. It or not It,
being included with a group of kids in a playground game would have
been heaven." The ban has been the focus of at least one radio talk
show in which callers blasted Samarge's decision for about an hour.
The idea that being "it," the one player everyone runs from to avoid
being tagged and becoming the next "it," somehow damages a child's
self-esteem struck many listeners as preposterous.</TE>
<TE>   "It's laugh-out-loud funny," said John Kobylt, co-host of KFI's
"John &amp; Ken Show." "They're practically criminalizing an innocent
child's game by applying terms like 'victim.' It's a game that
everybody played as a kid. It's amazing. Where do they come up with
this stuff?"</TE>
<TE>   The hubbub caught Samarge off guard, and she has spent many hours
since explaining, clarifying and justifying her action. To her, and
to assistant principal Barry Yates, who helped impose the new rule,
the episode has demonstrated to them how simple issues get blown out
of proportion.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty surprised by all the response," said Samarge.
"Extremely surprised," added Yates.</TE>
<TE>   The issue arose May 27 when Samarge informed parents via a weekly
school newsletter that tag would not be allowed. But the new
restriction, contrary to how it has been interpreted by some, was not
an outright ban. Indeed, tag and other chase games are still played
on campus, but under the supervision of physical education teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The new prohibition only applies during the lunch recess of the
kindergarten-through-fifth-grade school, when there aren't enough
adult teachers and volunteers on duty to ensure that the game will be
safely played, said Samarge. In the past school year, tag and other
chase games have been responsible for two concussions, a couple
broken bones and countless bumps, bruises and scrapes among the
students, she added. (For similar reasons, flag football was also
forbidden during recess but, like tag, is played during physical
education classes.)</TE>
<TE>   Most California school systems, including the Los Angeles Unified
School District, don't have explicit policies regarding tag. It's
left to the discretion of playground teachers and supervisors whether
to initiate the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The students being hurt weren't always the ones playing the game,
either," said Yates, who is in his third year at Franklin. "The kids
playing are rarely looking where they are going but are looking
around to see who is chasing them. Then, they plow into somebody,
usually a small kid."</TE>
<TE>   The tag ban was only one part of a comprehensive program designed
to improve safety on Franklin's campus of about 820 students. Recent
upgrades include reconfiguring fencing, positioning a greeter at the
school entrance and hiring crossing guards. The actions recently
earned the school a top award for safety from the state PTA.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all based on safety," said Samarge, also in her third
year as school principal. "It has nothing to do with anything else
except to reduce injuries for the kids."</TE>
<TE>   But there was that statement in the school newsletter that seemed
to trigger the debate. In the third paragraph of an article titled
"Safety on the Playground," the piece reads: "The running part of
this activity is healthy and encouraged; however, in this game, there
is a 'victim' or 'It,' which creates a self-esteem issue. The oldest
or biggest child usually dominates."</TE>
<TE>   Such a connection between tag and diminished self-esteem is a hard
sell as far as Deborah Stipek, dean of Stanford University's School
of Education, is concerned. Stipek, who specializes in childhood
education, said kids need to burn off energy, and tag accomplishes
that goal. Tag also can help combat the rising tide of childhood
obesity, she added.</TE>
<TE>   "As with almost any game like kickball or football, it's not the
game in and of itself, so much as how the game is played," said
Stipek. "If it's played fairly where everyone gets to be "it," and
when kids get tagged they aren't shoved into the wall, there's no
deep psychological concerns lurking there."</TE>
<TE>   But, when it comes to safety, Stipek sympathizes with the Franklin
administrators. "I can see where safety can be a problem," said
Stipek. "Kids can get distracted, and certainly in a school where
there have been injuries you'd want to better supervise it or find
alternatives."</TE>

<LD>They are flashier than a Benetton ad, more fanatical than a religious
cult. And with all due respect to Kobe and Shaq, they are taking part
in the only sports tournament whose winners truly deserve to be
called "world champions."</LD>
<LD>   They are football enthusiasts, or "soccer fans" as they're called
in this parochial corner of the planet. Sporting face paint and
fright wigs, feathered headdresses and sombrero-studded bras, they're
gathering in Japan and South Korea this month to cheer on teams from
32 nations competing in the 17th World Cup tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, national pride and self-advertisement propel these
over-the-top fashion statements. But so does a sense of community, a
cosmopolitan spirit of belonging to a joyous and decorous human
pageant that arrives but once every four years. The carnivale
attitude that animates these faces is what is making the World
Cup--for a few brief weeks this summer--the pulsating capital of the
global village.</LD>

<LD>Two producers rushed around the waiting rooms of the Burbank studio,
breathlessly asking after the welfare of their guests. "Are you all
right? Do you need anything? Are you thirsty? Hungry?" When one woman
asked for water, she was led to a kitchen, where several tables were
piled high with vegetables, and Wolfgang Puck's cooking crew worked
frantically to prepare dishes for the chef's Food Network show, next
in line for the sound stage.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, sex columnist Anka Radakovich waited her turn in the
greenroom, a tiny place furnished with two black leather loveseats
and a TV monitor. The columnist's jet black hair, pale complexion,
red lipstick and all-black ensemble suggested she was the lone
Manhattanite in the room. She was waiting to be interviewed by
sisters Jennifer Berman, 37, (a urologist) and Laura Berman, 33, (a
sex therapist), the well-coiffed and bubbly hosts of the new
Discovery Health Channel show "Berman &amp; Berman: For Women Only,"
which airs Friday evenings.</LD>
<TE>   From the greenroom monitor, Radakovich was watching the Bermans
ask two Playboy playmates, Ava Fabian (Miss August, 1986) and Julie
McCullough (Miss September, 1986), why they believe sex sells. Their
answers were drowned out by Radakovich's response. "Because men are
dogs," she said to the television, without a smile. Moments later,
the sex columnist was ushered into the studio past the two tanned and
platinum blond models, who were on their way out. Soon, the Bermans
were quizzing Radakovich, who writes for the provocative men's
magazine Razor, on why men respond to sex in the media. "Sex is a
very powerful thing," Radakovich said. "Really, I think we should
sexually exploit men." This prompted lots of nervous laughter from
the all-female audience. Radakovich didn't smile.</TE>
<TE>   The Bermans relish this type of candid talk. The show is an
outgrowth of their successful book "For Women Only: A Revolutionary
Guide to Reclaiming Your Sex Life," (Henry Holt and Co., 2001).
"We're trying to remove some of the taboos that have been associated
with women ... the belief or societal perception that 'nice girls
don't' and that if you're too entitled to your sexuality then you're
a slut," said Jennifer Berman. "The goal of the show is to provide
state-of-the-art, cutting-edge information in a down-to-earth,
accessible way," Laura Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bermans, who first earned fame in 1998 with published studies
on the use of Viagra on women, were recruited last year from Boston
by UCLA to open the Female Sexual Medicine Center on the Westwood
campus. Soon, they were fielding TV show pitches, so they got an
agent and developed their own talk show.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't intend to do a television show," Laura Berman said.
"Clearly, there is a need." Their Discovery Health show premiered in
April. Now the sisters spend weekends in the studio and weekdays
seeing patients. "I don't know if I could pull this off in Boston ...
be on television every day and then show up to work and be respected
as a physician and scholar," Jennifer Berman said. "But here in L.A.?
We've got a lot of support."</TE>
<TE>   Their Day in Court</TE>
<TE>   Former Third Eye Blind guitarist Kevin Cadogan and former bandmate
Stephan Jenkins will share an audience this month for the first time
since Cadogan left the band abruptly in January 2000. The venue: the
Oakland courtroom of U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilkin.</TE>
<TE>   Cadogan is suing Jenkins, the band and the band's manager, Eric
Godtland, to recover hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid
royalties for recording, producing and writing, as well as "shared
mechanical royalties" for copyright ownership of the songs, according
to Cadogan's San Francisco attorney Geoffrey Spellberg.</TE>
<TE>   Cadogan filed a separate lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court
in April seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in performance
royalties, Spellberg said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the guitarist's departure, the band had sold more
than 4 million copies of its self-titled 1997 debut album. "The
underlying theme [of the suits] is Kevin brought value to the band
and then was kicked out," said Spellberg. "Then the band capitalized
on that value .... The lawsuit is basically about those amounts that
weren't paid."</TE>
<TE>   Cadogan says he was unlawfully fired from the band when members
left him in Park City, Utah, after a performance. The next day, Third
Eye Blind performed on the "Tonight Show" with a replacement
guitarist but allowed the broadcast of a band photo that featured
Cadogan, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   The case, which was filed in June 2000, is scheduled to go to
trial Monday, Spellberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins did not return calls for comment. In a March 2000
interview by The Times, he refused to elaborate on Cadogan's
departure but said of his former bandmate: "He's a really good
guitarist."</TE>

<HD>Clinic Offers Safety Tips for SUV Owners</HD>

<LD>In addition to being blamed for global warming, freeway crowding, the
lack of decent parking spaces at the mall and America's dependence on
foreign oil, owners of sport utility vehicles often face criticism
from the anti-SUV crowd for buying vehicles they claim aren't safe
and aren't needed.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, SUVs do have a higher center of gravity than other
vehicles, which makes them less stable in some circumstances. And
there are estimates that fewer than 20% of all SUVs are driven
off-road--although going off-road was a major reason for the
introduction in the early 1980s of the family-friendly,
four-wheel-drive vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   But some people who purchase SUVs, whether compact Jeep or giant
Hummer, do plan to use them for their intended purpose of making
off-road trips possible.</LD>
<TE>   To help them do so with a maximum of safety and enjoyment and a
minimum of ecological impact, the California Assn. of Four Wheel
Drive Clubs periodically offers a one-day SUV safety clinic on a
special course at the Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area,
just off Interstate 5 near Gorman.</TE>
<TE>   The class won't make SUVs acceptable to those who don't like them
and don't see why anyone else would. But chief instructor Harry Baker
says it can help owners and drivers better understand and manage
their vehicles for maximum safety--on road and off.</TE>
<TE>   The next clinic is Saturday. Although preregistration is
encouraged (www.4x4quest.com; (818) 705-3930), Baker says people who
show up the morning of the class won't be turned away.</TE>
<TE>   Fee for the all-day program is $85 a person.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic includes a four-hour classroom session devoted to
vehicle preparation, safety and environmental issues, and a four-hour
driving session that helps SUV owners understand the pluses and
minuses of their vehicles by teaching them to handle the terrain and
obstacles they would typically experience on an off-road trip.</TE>

<HD>Absence of Coordinated Reporting Hampers Accident Analysis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>Second of two parts.</SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An automobile accident occurs somewhere in the United States about
every two seconds, producing not only a lot of crumpled metal and
blood on the pavement but also millions of hours of investigation and
mountains of paperwork for law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   Police agencies are the source of much of what we know about
automobile safety, because they are the early-warning system that
theoretically alerts the public about safety defects, dangerous
drivers and poorly engineered roads.</LD>
<LD>   Although most experts say police get good marks for training and
professionalism, the system itself has defects. Some accidents
receive superficial or flawed investigations, problems other than
driver error often are overlooked and even the best reports get lost
in an antiquated data system.</LD>
<TE>   What the U.S. really has is 50 different accident investigation
systems, operated by hundreds of agencies with differing standards,
all generally stuck with the same 1950s information technology.</TE>
<TE>   As a priority, accident investigation, particularly for property
damage crashes, ranks near the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people would rather have police investigating and preventing
homicides, robberies and cats in the tree than spend time on
noninjury accidents," said Steve Switzer, a former accident
investigator for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "Few
cadets want to work traffic. That's not what they show on TV."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, 41,821 people die on the highways every year, more
than twice the number of deaths nationwide from homicide and
negligent manslaughter. Indeed, the 16.4 million annual accidents,
documented in a recent federal report, exceed the 11.6 million
criminal offenses reported each year.</TE>
<TE>   Police agencies across the state and nation vary widely in the
amount of training they provide traffic patrol officers. In many
cases, agencies provide little intermediate or advanced training.</TE>
<TE>   California requires only eight hours of basic training in how to
conduct an automobile accident investigation for police, providing no
instruction in automobile mechanics, accident reconstruction or
highway engineering.</TE>
<TE>   But some localities try to do better.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. County Sheriff's Department provides 20 hours of
training, the city of Long Beach 40 hours and the California Highway
Patrol 86 hours.</TE>
<TE>   In many departments, officers receive advanced training and attend
one of the nation's three major accident investigation schools: at
Northwestern University, the University of North Carolina or the
University of South Florida.</TE>
<TE>   But that's no guarantee that an officer who arrives at an accident
scene will be equipped to determine whether a shredded tire caused a
sport utility vehicle to turn over or whether the tire shredded as a
consequence of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Carra, director of the federal government's National Center
for Statistics and Analysis--the central repository for all accident
reporting--acknowledges the uneven quality of investigation: "It
varies from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the few known studies of investigation accuracy,
Northwestern University found in 1991 that police accident reports
were factually accurate only 70% of the time. And that doesn't
necessarily reflect on the validity of the investigators' analyses.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Edmonds, who spent 22 years with the L.A. County Sheriff's
Department and helped establish its accident investigation training
program, estimates that 15% to 20% of police conclusions are rejected
by insurance companies as incorrect or unsubstantiated.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds, who now operates a private accident investigation firm,
Crash Facts, in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., said few police officers are
trained to look for defects or to consider poor highway design.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a question about the brakes, they put their foot on
the brake and pump it. Well, they just destroyed the evidence,"
Edmonds said. "Nothing is ever done with highway design."</TE>
<TE>   An exception is the CHP. The agency runs eight special
multidisciplinary accident investigation teams able to diagnose any
cause of a serious pileup. Each includes two CHP officers, with more
than 300 hours of classroom training, and a state highway engineer.
But the teams investigate only the worst accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Perez, CHP's chief for enforcement services, said CHP reports
are more thoroughly reviewed by supervisors than are reports at any
other agency he is aware of. He said he believes CHP report accuracy
is nearly perfect.</TE>
<TE>   As police churn out accident reports, accurate or not, the data
flow upstream in massive rivers to state and federal agencies. But
much of the information is incompatible and not particularly useful
to safety experts.</TE>
<TE>   In California, local police accident reports are sent to the CHP,
where they are coded and keyed into the Statewide Integrated Traffic
Reporting System.</TE>
<TE>   It contains data on injuries, time of day, alcohol involvement and
other facts collected by police. A sampling of this data is forwarded
to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which uses it
in various databases.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the data from California and other states are often
inconsistent. And nowhere can investigators find a unified national
database that allows computerized searching of accident report texts.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason not to have a standardized accident reporting
form," said Thomas M. Klein, a Los Angeles attorney who represents
automobile manufacturers and conducts his own accident research.</TE>
<TE>   Klein recalls that in a recent effort to examine accidents for a
client, he could find only four states--Michigan, Texas, Florida and
North Carolina--that require reports to contain four key pieces of
information: the vehicle identification numbers of the vehicles
involved in the accident; a TADS, or total accident damage index; an
injury index called CABCO; and a report on occupant ejection from the
vehicle. In an ideal world, police not only would use standardized
reporting forms, but also would dispense with written reports and
file electronically from a handheld computer. Hertz and Avis have
used them for years to speed customers on their way: If police could
do so, accident data would flow instantly up the channels.</TE>
<TE>   An investigator in Washington would be able to search in real time
for information about the 45,000 accidents that occur every day. On
any given day, for example, one might want to know about accidents
that involved a specific SUV model, serious injuries and shredded
tires.</TE>
<TE>   If that capability existed, some people who lost their lives in
Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires might still be alive.</TE>

<HD>Picking the Right Car for the Graduate</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM MATEJA</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seems like it was only a few years ago you were changing the kid's
diapers.</LD>
<LD>   Now you're doing his or her laundry on those monthly visits home.</LD>
<LD>   But soon--if not already--the child will don cap and gown, grab a
diploma and be earning a regular income (after a year's vacation to
determine what to do in life, because that wasn't found in the four
to five years of college).</LD>
<TE>   And what better way to kick the kid out--er, better make that to
help the child launch a new, self-supporting career--than to buy, or
co-sign for, a new vehicle?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, parents may argue that after what they've just spent on
the education, the kid owes them a new vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case might be, calls and letters with the common
question for this time of year--"What kind of car to get the
grad?"--are accumulating.</TE>
<TE>   The same kinds of inquiries come from the parents of soon-to-be
high school grads, and to them we say: Look for late-model used
versions of any of the below. As a rule of thumb, don't buy a really
old car if Junior is going away to school--unless you relish
emergency trips to help get the junker started--and don't buy new
unless the budget is unlimited.</TE>
<TE>   A new car, if Junior is knuckling down and studying, will spend
most of its time for the kid's college career sitting in parking
lots, gathering dirt. If driven a lot, of course, the car will return
home well in advance of four to five years, kid attached. And then,
in addition to berating yourself for having contributed to the
untimely termination of Junior's academic career by providing the
wheels that hastened the end, you'll kick yourself for having paid
the price of a new car.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have reason to shop new for a new grad, though,
here's a look at some relatively low-cost vehicles that won't make
Mom and Dad look cheap:</TE>
<TE>   * BMW Mini Cooper: If son or daughter is graduating from Harvard,
consider the remake of the British Mini. Low base price, but expect
some dealer add-ons for the low-volume, high-demand car.</TE>
<TE>   The trick--finding one. Waiting time at most dealerships for new
orders is about four months. The lower-production Mini Cooper S is
supercharged for more power. Base price: $16,300 for Cooper; $19,300
for Cooper S.</TE>
<TE>   * Chrysler PT Cruiser: Supply has caught up with demand, stocks
are up, and stickers are down. Nice looks, nice mileage (20 mpg city
and 25 highway), good people and cargo room and a decent price.</TE>
<TE>   With optional anti-lock brakes and traction control ($595), a
surprisingly good performer in lousy weather. Base price: $17,000 to
$20,000, depending on model.</TE>
<TE>   * Ford Focus ZX3: The two-door hatchback is a high-mileage
subcompact coupe, but you must add $400 for ABS or $1,625 for ABS
with traction control, and $1,000 for the power group that adds power
windows, mirrors and locks. Mileage: 25/31. Base price: $12,000 to
$14,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Ford Focus ZX5: The roomier four-door hatchback with good
mileage (25/34). Expect to add options, primarily $1,225 for Advance
Trac, which requires ABS at an additional $400. The sophisticated
stability and traction control system is borrowed from the Lincoln LS
and is unique among small cars. Base price: $15,615.</TE>
<TE>   * Honda Accord SE sedan: For the practical grad. The Accord has
Honda's reputation for quality and durability. Mileage is rated at
23/30 with the four-cylinder, four-speed automatic. A lot of car for
the money, but soon will be replaced by a bigger, more powerful,
higher-priced model. Base price: $20,850.</TE>
<TE>   * Honda Civic hybrid: For the environmentalist grad. The
gasoline-electric hybrid boasts a highly economical mileage rating of
48/48. It comes as a four-door sedan with ample room in cabin and
trunk. Doesn't have green leaves plastered on the doors to advertise
that it's out of the ordinary. Base price: $21,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Hyundai Elantra GT: A good-looking compact powered by a
high-mileage (24/33) four-cylinder engine. But to get anti-lock
brakes you must spend nearly $1,200--which gets a power moon roof as
well. Go figure. Base price: About $14,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Kia Optima SE: Compact sedan with long list of standard
equipment and a V-6 engine. ABS adds about $800. Pleasant ride and
handling from an economy car for the budget-minded. Base price: About
$19,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Mazda Protege ES: A sporty compact sedan with lots of room and
good mileage (25/31) from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine linked
to a five-speed manual transmission. Great safety record and a
moderate sticker price. ABS is an $800 option but includes side air
bags. Other options to consider, a six-disc in-dash CD changer for
$500 and a four-speed automatic for $800. Base price: $15,630.</TE>
<TE>   * Pontiac Vibe/Toyota Matrix. The 180-horsepower Vibe GT model of
this Toyota-designed sport wagon-cum-SUV (Toyota calls its version
the XRS) comes with a six-speed manual and a high-revving 1.8-liter
four-cylinder engine. Both get good mileage (21/28) but require
premium gas (other models get by on regular). You'll probably need
the $600 power package for windows and locks on the Vibe--they're
standard on the slightly pricier Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   For $500 more, Pontiac will sell your grad a "moon and tunes"
package--sunroof and 200-watt sound system. Looks more like a sport
utility vehicle and less like a wagon than its Toyota Matrix cousin.
Four-wheel ABS and air conditioning are standard, along with AM/FM
radio with CD player. Base price: $19,340.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's similarly equipped version, called the Matrix XRS, goes
for $19,285. Pontiac has just three models--base, all-wheel-drive and
GT, starting at $16,900. Toyota breaks the same three models into
eight different trim and equipment levels, starting at $15,155.</TE>
<TE>   * Toyota Corolla S sedan ('03): The reputation for Toyota quality
in a package bigger than the Echo. A 32/40 mpg rating. Expect to
spend at least $1,000 on amenities such as power windows and ABS.
Bigger and roomier than previ- ous versions with more standard
equipment. Base: $14,515.</TE>
<TE>   * Toyota Echo: Not real big on the outside but surprisingly ample
inside. A four-cylinder with the energy--but not the quiet--of a
small V-6. But the 32 mpg city/38 mpg highway mileage brings its own
peace. Base price: $11,325.</TE>
<TE>   * Volkswagen New Beetle Turbo S: Any Beetle is a good choice, but
the long-awaited higher-performance version of the economy car offers
pep the others fall short on. Beetle with a bang. Or hold off until
fall for the even longer-awaited convertible. Base price: $23,400.</TE>
<TE>   * Others worth considering: The Suzuki Aerio SX, a high-mileage,
$15,999, fully equipped hatchback; Saturn Vue, a sport ute for about
$19,000 with all-wheel-drive, respectable mileage (21/26) and
no-rust, plastic body panels; Mitsubishi Lancer sedan, $13,938 to
$15,888, a youth-oriented economy car with roomy interior; and the
'03 Hyundai Tiburon, an attractive sports coupe with good performance
that starts at $17,999.</TE>
<TE>   If the grad is exiting high school and heading to college or into
the working world, any of the above in used versions are appropriate
choices.</TE>
<TE>   But you may have to scout around for models with ABS and traction
control (options that are more important if college is in upstate New
York than if Junior is sticking around Southern California--unless
Junior is a snowboarder).</TE>
<TE>   To spot anti-lock brakes and traction systems in a used car if you
don't have access to the original window sticker with all the
equipment listed, look for the ABS and TC lights on the instrument
panel to go on when you turn the key.</TE>

<HD>From Royales to Jags, 'Million Dollar Cars' Exhibition Will
Offer an Exciting Ride</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are the creme de la creme, the top of the heap: automobiles
worth $1 million or more, often much more, to today's collectors.</LD>
<LD>   There aren't all that many, and the Petersen Automotive Museum in
Los Angeles has gathered 28 of them, with a total value of $125
million, for a special fifth anniversary exhibition.</LD>
<LD>   Opening night Thursday will be a $200-per-person affair expected
to attract 1,200 or more of Southern California's leading auto
enthusiasts, including celebrities such as "Tonight Show" host Jay
Leno and racing greats such as Dan Gurney and Carroll Shelby.</LD>
<TE>   The exhibition, which opens to the public Friday, offers a galaxy
of vehicles, including the only Bugatti Royale that made it to the
U.S.--one of six Royales ever built and valued at about $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the cars in the exhibition are the 1956 Jaguar XKSS
once owned by actor and driving enthusiast Steve McQueen; the 1934
Dusenberg "Mormon Meteor" race car that set numerous land speed
records on Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats; and the 1937 Mercedes-Benz
540K Special Roadster the late Jack Warner, head of Warner Bros.
Studios, used for several decades. Warner bought the car, one of only
three built, off the Mercedes-Benz stand at the Paris Auto Show.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest car in the show is an aluminum-bodied 1964 Ferrari
GTO, one of just 39 built as dual purpose road-and-race cars.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest is the 1901 "Sweepstakes" race car built by a guy named
Henry Ford. He raced it once, but that was enough. His winnings and
the public acclaim from his first and only race gave him the help he
needed to start a little business in 1903 that he called Ford Motor
Co.</TE>
<TE>   If you can afford the $200 tariff to rub shoulders with the auto
world glitterati, you'll not only come home with some celebrity
sighting stories to tell, you'll also get a preview of the "Million
Dollar Cars" exhibition and the thanks of museum benefactors Robert
E. and Margie Petersen.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's gala is the largest annual fund-raiser for the
nonprofit museum and its children's programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we had over 1,200 guests and we raised over $700,000,
and this year we expect even more guests and are hopeful of making
over $1 million," said Margie Petersen, co-hostess of the gala.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets can be purchased at the museum at 6060 Wilshire Blvd. in
Los Angeles, or by calling (323) 964-6366.</TE>
<TE>   If your bank account won't stretch that far, you still can catch
the "Million Dollar Cars" show. It opens to the public Friday and
runs through January. Museum admission for adults will be $10 instead
of the usual $7 during the run of the exhibition. The $5 fee for
students and seniors and the $3 fee for children between 5 and 12
won't change.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's gala and exhibition opening are part of the California
Classic Weekend, which includes a Barrett-Jackson Auction Co. sale of
hot rods and collector and celebrity cars Friday and Saturday
(www.barrett-jackson.com, or (480) 421-6694).</TE>
<TE>   The weekend wraps up with the annual Concours on Rodeo car show,
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday on Rodeo Drive at Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>

to lengthen the school year at multitrack campuses in Los Angeles
incorrectly stated that Garfield High School has been on a
three-track, year-round calendar for nearly 20 years. The East Los

<LD>Genentech verdict--A Section A story Tuesday said securities analyst
Jonathan Aschoff of Friedman Billings Ramsey told Bloomberg News that
Genentech Inc. had budgeted up to $500 million in the event of a
verdict against it in a lawsuit brought by City of Hope National
Medical Center. In fact, Aschoff told Reuters news service, not
Bloomberg, that Genentech "appeared to have prepared investors" for a
total judgment against it of $500 million in a worst-case outcome
from the long-running case.</LD>

<HD>USDA Won't Lower Marks for Organic Foods</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Agency says it will begin survey of
availability of feed grain as part of farm bill signed last month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Agriculture Department, whose move to consider loosening the
standards by which meat can be labeled organic sparked public outcry,
said Monday that it would not make any changes to the new rules and
that they will be implemented in October as planned.</LD>
<LD>   "We are fully implementing it as it is written," said USDA
spokeswoman Alisa Harrison.</LD>
<LD>   Organic farming officials said the move is a tentative victory in
maintaining the integrity of the organic label, which was called into
question after USDA officials said they were considering a request by
a Georgia poultry company to allow it and other livestock companies
to sell meat that had not been given 100% organic feed.</LD>
<TE>   Fieldale Farms Corp., the company asking for the feed waiver, said
there was not enough organic feed available in the market to supply
its and others' needs--a point that industry officials disputed.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Organic Trade Assn., which represents the organic
food industry, said such a decision would have rendered the term
organic meaningless for a wide range of products.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA will begin looking into availability of organic grain for
this rapidly growing industry, surveying farmers through 2004 as
required by the farm bill signed by President Bush last month. Sen.
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) urged Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman
to aid farmers looking to convert to organic feed production without
weakening federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison would not say whether the USDA would consider any further
exemptions or waivers based upon the survey's findings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Fieldale officials said the firm will sell only as much
organic chicken as it can obtain feed for, and will divert the rest
to its "antibiotic free" label.</TE>
<TE>   Fieldale said it will continue to lobby the USDA to "provide for
flexibility in labeling" and "commercial availability."</TE>

<LD>Liberate Technologies Inc., a San Carlos, Calif., maker of
interactive-television software, said fourth-quarter sales lagged
forecasts because the cable TV industry spent less. Sales in the
period ended May 31 were $20 million to $21 million, excluding
certain items. Liberate had estimated sales of $25 million to $25.5
million.</LD>
<LD>   Liberate's software lets subscribers connect to the Internet from
TV sets and order movies on cable. The company said cable network
operators put off the introduction of digital services. The company
said it still expects to report a loss of 6 cents a share before some
costs, based on a preliminary review. Liberate plans to issue final
quarterly results June 2.</LD>
<LD>   Its shares fell 17%, or 60 cents, to $2.97 on Nasdaq, its lowest
close since the company's IPO in July 1999.</LD>

<HD>Report by GAO Critical of ICANN</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The company that administers the system that approves Internet
addresses is too secretive, too slow to plug security holes and too
loosely regulated, investigators concluded in a report to be
presented to a congressional panel today.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Commerce subcommittee on science, technology and space
will hear testimony from critics and the Internet Corp. for Assigned
Names and Numbers.</LD>
<LD>   Critics said ICANN, based in Marina del Rey, has not moved quickly
enough to protect the security of the Internet's domain name system,
which translates common Web site addresses to strings of numbers
understood by computers.</LD>
<TE>   "ICANN's legitimacy and effectiveness as the private sector
manager of the domain name system [remains] in question," the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in
testimony prepared for the hearing by the Senate panel.</TE>
<TE>   The report, obtained Tuesday by the Associated Press, says the
Commerce Department has not assumed a strong enough role in
overseeing ICANN. Commerce's public comments have been "general in
nature and infrequent," and no detailed minutes exist of meetings
between ICANN and Commerce officials.</TE>
<TE>   ICANN President Stuart Lynn, who plans to resign next year,
defended his group, saying that Commerce already has "tremendous
oversight" over its work. Lynn announced plans for an ICANN
reorganization several months ago. The plan has not been approved
yet, but it already has outraged critics because it would remove
elected ICANN board members.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Palm Inc. Chairman Eric Benhamou said new products should boost sales
this year in the moribund hand-held computer industry, but he expects
growth of about 10% in 2003, short of analysts' expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Benhamou said during the Bear Stearns technology conference that
industry analysts currently expect growth of about 18% in 2003, but
he expects analysts to recalibrate their outlooks after a poor start
for the first quarter of 2002. Palm said last month that sales for
its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in May, missed its target by
up to 23% and pushed back hopes of an operating profit until the
quarter ending in November. Analysts have said recent industry sales
are tracking as much as 20% lower than last year.</LD>
<LD>   Palm shares gained 9 cents to $1.58 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<HD>Dell Considering Addition of Routers</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dell Computer Corp., which began competing with Cisco Systems Inc.
last year by selling computer-network switches, is considering a bid
to move deeper into Cisco's territory by adding routers and other
network gear.</LD>
<LD>   Dell, the No. 2 personal-computer maker, gets wider profit margins
from network equipment than computers, said Kim Crawford, vice
president for the networking business. Dell probably would sell
low-end routers to small and mid-size offices, a $3-billion market,
rather than higher-capacity gear used in large telecommunications
networks, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Texas-based Dell would have to undercut Cisco routers, which
connect computers to the Internet, that sell for less than $650,
Gartner Group analyst Lawrence Orans said. Cisco "should be worried
about Dell," he said. "Cisco continues to be premium priced."</LD>
<TE>   Dell shares fell 32 cents to $25.91; Cisco declined 48 cents to
$14.99. Both trade on Nasdaq.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alliance Capital Management and its French parent AXA Financial have
accumulated 10.9% of the stock of WorldCom Inc., the troubled
telephone and data network company. AXA, an insurance and financial
services company, filed documents with the Securities and Exchange
Commission showing it held 321.8 million shares of WorldCom as of May
31. All but about 300,000 of those shares are held by Alliance
Capital on behalf of its investor clients.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC filing did not show how much was paid for the stock, which
has lost 90% of its value over the last year, or during what period
it was accumulated. WorldCom's stock fell 11 cents to $1.49 on
Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the AXA purchases could give the financial company
the voting power needed to influence decisions by WorldCom's board of
directors or to possibly bid for control of the company. Experts said
such actions were unlikely, suggesting that the purchases could be
seen as a show of faith in WorldCom's long-term prospects.</LD>

<HD>Allergan Accused of Blocking Rivals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allergan Inc. has been accused in a lawsuit of using its patents and
litigation to block low-cost rivals of its $250-million-a-year
glaucoma treatment Alphagan.</LD>
<LD>   Alphagan user Jean Loman, who filed the suit, seeks class-action
status to represent others who bought Alphagan since March.</LD>
<LD>   The suit says the Irvine eye-care and skin-care company improperly
sought patents in an effort to block generic competition.</LD>
<TE>   Allergan's general counsel, Douglas Ingram, called the lawsuit
"frivolous."</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed after U.S. District Judge David Carter in Santa
Ana dismissed Allergan's patent-infringement claims against
generic-drug makers Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. and Alcon Laboratories Inc., a
unit of Swiss food maker Nestle.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan sued the companies after they sought Food and Drug
Administration approval to sell generic versions of Alphagan.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan's "baseless patent-infringement litigation is delaying
and preventing the entry of generic formulations of Alphagan into the
United States market," according to Loman's suit, filed June 6 in
federal court in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Ingram said Allergan's suits had no effect on the FDA's review of
the applications by Bausch &amp; Lomb and Alcon.</TE>
<TE>   "No generic version of Alphagan would have been on the market even
without the lawsuits," Ingram said.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan stock fell $1.80 to $61.15 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Jury to Enter 7th Day</HD>

<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The jury in accounting firm Arthur Andersen's obstruction-of-justice
trial returned to its hotel without reaching a verdict Tuesday after
a sixth day of deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   For the second day in a row, the panel of nine men and three women
made no requests for information. The jurors have not indicated which
way they are leaning in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The length of deliberations over the single count of obstruction
has fueled speculation of a divided jury. A unanimous verdict is
needed to either acquit or convict Andersen.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a unique experience for me," Andersen defense attorney
Rusty Hardin told reporters Tuesday, referring to the amount of time
the jury has been meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never come close to this," added Hardin, a courtroom veteran
as both a prosecutor and a defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a divided jury, U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon
would issue at least one admonition to the jurors to try to resolve
differences before moving to declare a hung jury and a mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   The jury is considering whether the accounting firm obstructed
justice by shredding Enron Corp.-related audit papers in the fall
with the intent to undermine a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe.</TE>
<TE>   Conviction probably would result in a fine and an expected SEC
sanction barring Andersen from auditing public companies. But
Andersen has been losing its biggest clients and company officials
acknowledge it will not regain its former stature, even with an
acquittal.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Aura Executives Reach Deal With SEC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Settling charges they overstated sales by tens of millions of
dollars, former top executives of Aura Systems Inc. have agreed to
pay fines and be barred from running public companies, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Concluding an accounting fraud investigation begun in 1999, an SEC
lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court accused El Segundo-based Aura of
reporting $26.5 million in fictitious sales in 1997 and 1998, and
booking $2.5 million in contract revenue in 1997 that it earned and
booked in earlier periods.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC also alleged that NewCom Inc. of Westlake Village,
majority owned by Aura, falsified its balance sheet by at least $43.2
million in 1998 and 1999 by booking fictitious sales, prematurely
recognizing revenue and overstating receivables and inventory.</LD>
<TE>   In a 16-year history, Aura has sold products including
loudspeakers, vibrating vests for video games and emergency
generators powered by pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   But the company remained unprofitable despite raising $120 million
in the public markets. It lost $54.5 million on sales of $11.4
million over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a truly egregious case," said Cheryl Scarboro, the SEC's
assistant director of enforcement, referring to the accusations of
fabricating revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants settled the charges without admitting or denying
guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Former Aura Chief Executive Zvi "Harry" Kurtzman was barred for
life from being an officer or director of a public company and fined
$75,000. Citing a cease and desist order it reached in 1996 with
Kurtzman, the SEC said it had pursued him as a "recidivist" violator
of anti-fraud laws. His attorney, Susan Swingle, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Former Aura and NewCom Chief Financial Officer Steven C. Veen was
fined $50,000, and was barred for five years from serving as an
officer or director of a public company, or practicing as an
accountant before the SEC. His lawyer didn't return a phone call.</TE>
<TE>   Aura Systems, NewCom, Veen and Kurtzman also agreed to permanent
injunctions against future acts of securities fraud, as did former
NewCom President Sultan Khan and Executive Vice President Asif Khan.
The Khans' lawyer didn't return a call.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also issued cease and desist orders against Korea Data
Systems Inc. of Garden Grove and its officers John Hui and Ben Wong,
who were accused of allowing Aura to report falsely that it had
bought and resold KDS computer monitors. KDS was fined $25,000; its
attorney declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Former Aura President Gerald S. Papazian, who wasn't a defendant
in the lawsuit, separately agreed to pay a $25,000 fine and not to
violate securities laws. His attorney couldn't be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Aura rose a penny to 15 cents a share in OTC Bulletin
Board trading.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A New Jersey software company sued Conexant Systems Inc. and Alpha
Industries Inc. to block them from naming their merged wireless
semiconductor company Skyworks Solutions Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Skyworks Technologies Inc., a closely held developer of Web
promotional games, alleges in a federal trademark infringement suit
filed in Santa Ana that the companies are stealing its name.</LD>
<LD>   Alpha, based in Woburn, Mass., and the wireless business of
Conexant, based in Newport Beach, are expected to complete their
merger by Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The suit says their plan to use the Skyworks name and the Internet
domain name skyworksinc.com will cause confusion among consumers and
hurt Skyworks Technologies' business.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Alpha couldn't be reached for comment. An official
with Conexant referred questions to the new company's spokeswoman,
who had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Alpha shares rose 85 cents to $6.75, while shares of Conexant fell
22 cents to $4.78, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>St. John Knits International Inc., an Irvine designer of women's
clothing and accessories, reported net income of $7.3 million, or 89
cents a share, for its fiscal second quarter, unchanged from $7.3
million, or 93 cents a share, a year ago, hurt in part by increased
expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue declined 5% to $92.3 million for the quarter ended April
28 as an increase in sales at its stores failed to offset a decline
in wholesale sales, St. John Knits said. Sales at its full-price
stores rose 15% to $33.3 million, with sales at stores open at least
a year up 9.9%.</LD>
<LD>   The company operates 28 retail boutiques and 10 outlet apparel
stores as well as three home furnishing stores run through a wholly
owned subsidiary.</LD>
<TE>   St. John Knits shares closed unchanged at $36 in over-the-counter
trading. The earnings were announced after the markets closed.</TE>

<HD>Pressure On to Clear Way for DTV</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Congress anxious for Hollywood, Silicon
Valley to settle copyright-protection technology issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a closed-door meeting Tuesday, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.)
prodded representatives from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to settle
their differences over a copyright-protection technology designed to
accelerate the roll-out of digital television.</LD>
<LD>   Tauzin, who has been frustrated by the slow progress of DTV,
ordered parties to report back on their progress by July 15. The
deadline represents Tauzin's most aggressive step yet to involve the
federal government in the private-sector talks between entertainment
companies and electronics firms.</LD>
<LD>   "He left upbeat and convinced more than ever that it's still
possible to resolve many, if not most, of these issues without
resorting to regulation or legislation," said Ken Johnson, spokesman
for Tauzin, who chairs the House Commerce Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives of some of the major entertainment and electronics
companies welcomed the new deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "Left to their own devices, these industries will probably never
get together," said Andrew G. Setos, president of engineering at Fox
Group and co-chair of an inter-industry working group, called the
Broadcast Protection Discussion Subgroup.</TE>
<TE>   The group was expected to wrap up negotiations earlier this month
on a technology known as a "broadcast flag," which would embed a code
inside a digital TV signal and prevent copyrighted TV shows from
being retransmitted over the Internet. But the final report lacked a
consensus on key questions, such as whether consumers should have the
rights to make and move personal copies of digital TV programs and
how future copyright-protection technologies should be selected and
approved.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment companies have been reluctant to release digital TV
programs on free, over-the-air television because they fear programs
will be copied and swapped over the Internet, similar to the way
digital music is traded online. Electronics firms worry that the
public may reject new technologies if they are overly restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   During a 2 1/2 hour meeting in Washington, Tauzin told
participants to clarify their positions by this Friday on how far
they believe copyright protections should extend inside consumers'
homes. Most agree, for example, that viewers should be able to
transfer a digital TV program from the living room to the bedroom via
a home network. But questions remain about whether they should be
able to include an excerpt of a digital TV show in an e-mail to a
friend or transfer a digital copy over the Internet to their vacation
home.</TE>
<TE>   Once a broader consensus is reached, it is expected that Congress
will adopt some of the recommendations and weigh in with its own
views about consumers' rights.</TE>
<TE>   One participant, Philips Electronics, urged Tauzin to replace the
working group--which it complains has been dominated by large
entertainment and electronics firms--with a government-sponsored
advisory panel. The company remains pessimistic that a consensus will
be reached by next month.</TE>

<LD>Son-in-Law of Adelphia Founder Resigns Post</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia Communications Corp., the cash-strapped cable-television
provider whose accounting is being investigated by U.S. regulators,
said Peter Venetis resigned as director.</LD>
<LD>   A special committee of the board had urged him to step down last
month, Adelphia said in a statement. Venetis is the son-in-law of
company founder John Rigas, who resigned as chairman and chief
executive in May. Rigas' sons, Timothy, Michael and James, also have
quit the board.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia, in default on more than $7 billion in bank debt and
delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market, is on the brink of filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, investors have said. Adelphia
shares have plunged more than 99% since the company revealed in March
that it had guaranteed billions in loans to Rigas family partnerships
that weren't included on the balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   The Coudersport, Pa.-based company restated two years of results
Monday and said it had fired auditor Deloitte &amp; Touche. Its Century
Communications unit sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors, a
move that may precede a bankruptcy filing by the parent, analysts
said.</TE>

<TE>   The contract covers staff and freelance members who work in news,

statement.</TE>
<TE>   The 3% raise is an across-the-board wage and fee increase each

<TE>   Also, freelance associate directors, stage managers and production
associates will receive a wage increase of more than 7% over the

<TE>   Judge Delays Love's Contract Dispute Trial</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles judge delayed the start of a trial pitting rock star
Courtney Love against music giant Universal Music in a
breach-of-contract case being closely watched as more music artists
challenge the terms of their record deals.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for both sides declined to comment about a meeting Monday
with a court-appointed mediator after the delay was imposed because
of a crowded court schedule. In December 1999, Love decided to stop
recording for Geffen, the Universal Music label named in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Music is the world's largest music company and a unit of
France's Vivendi Universal. Last year, the label and Universal Music
sued Love, seeking millions of dollars in damages for five
undelivered albums. Love countersued, also in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Adding Sizzle but No Steak?</HD>
<DH>Analysts say chains' quick fix won't boost long-term
fast-food sales</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With sales growth in the fast-food industry wilting like a soggy
hamburger, major chains such as McDonald's Corp., Burger King and
Carl's Jr. are trying to generate some excitement by unleashing a
tidal wave of new menu items.</LD>
<LD>   But, to paraphrase an adage, there is very little new under the
heat lamps.</LD>
<LD>   Quick-service giants, in their quest to boost profits and sales,
have largely forsaken innovation and originality in favor of
knockoffs of competitors' greatest hits. When not outright copying
rivals, they are introducing menu items heavily influenced by them.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts say that adding new products is only a short-term fix for
fast food's challenge of sparking long-term growth. Chains could be
better off improving food quality and cleanliness of stores, for
example. Even so, some appear to be benefiting from serving up dishes
first popularized by others.</TE>
<TE>   Carl's Jr.'s and Hardee's premium Six-Dollar Burger, a
less-expensive near copycat of a T.G.I. Friday's burger, has breathed
life into the formerly struggling chains, both of which are owned by
CKE Restaurants Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Subway's upscale honey oat and roasted garlic rolls,
apparently inspired by the more chi-chi Panera Bread Co., have helped
burnish the chain's image.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six months, Burger King has unveiled 13 new products,
including the BK 1/4 Lb. Burger, its version of a Quarter Pounder,
and the King Supreme, a knockoff Big Mac. Same-store sales, fueled
partly by the new additions, have increased after stagnating for
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, if [our competitors] are selling it, we can learn from
them," Burger King spokesman Rob Doughty said.</TE>
<TE>   Me-tooism has long pervaded the restaurant industry. McDonald's
begat Wendy's which begat Checkers. And chains are always coming out
with new menu items.</TE>
<TE>   But with fast food growing only at an inflation-adjusted 1.3%,
versus 2.5% in 1999, sandwich and pizza companies are adding products
at an unprecedented pace--and ripping each other off as never before,
said Christopher Muller, professor of restaurant management at the
University of Central Florida in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these restaurants are starting to look alike," he said.
"When everybody has a new menu, nobody has a new menu."</TE>
<TE>   Menu variety, however, might not be as important to consumers as
restaurant executives think, said Robert L. Sandelman, a Villa Park
restaurant consultant. In a recent national survey, he found that
fast-food customers ranked taste, food temperature and speed of
service ahead of choice, which placed 10th in 12 categories, he said.
Only the availability of nutritious food and a restaurant's appeal to
children placed behind variety.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than roll out a bunch of similar products, chains would do
better to improve service, clean up their restaurants and serve food
hot, said Hal Sieling, a Carlsbad, Calif., restaurant consultant.
Until they master the basics, many fast-food companies will continue
to lose customers to "fast-casual" outlets, which offer fresher and
often tastier food at a slightly higher price.</TE>
<TE>   As McDonald's has recently learned, adding lots of new
stuff doesn't always translate into roaring sales, experts said. The
chain's much-hyped New Tastes Menu, which rotates such "new"
offerings as chili burgers and McRib sandwiches year-round, has
failed to strike a chord with consumers, said Randall Hiatt of Fessel
International, a Costa Mesa restaurant consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's moved the needle at all," he said. "People go
to McDonald's for Big Macs and fries and not for chicken parmigiana
sandwiches."</TE>
<TE>   The burger giant has posted six consecutive quarters of declining
profit.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Golden, McDonald's vice president of U.S. marketing, said
consumers have liked many of the new items and that the 1 1/2-year
program has succeeded financially. He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   However, the right food item, especially a high-quality but
lower-priced knockoff, can succeed, said Richard Martin, managing
editor of Nation's Restaurant News.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the case with the Six-Dollar Burger, a heavily promoted
sandwich that actually sells for $3.95. When first introduced at its
Carl's Jr. chain last July, CKE Restaurants ran television ads
touting the sandwich as "like the burger I just paid about $6.25 for
at Friday's." The Six-Dollar Burger debuted at Hardee's four months
later.</TE>
<TE>   The sandwich, along with improved operations and the divestiture
of under-performing units, has helped engineer a turnaround at Santa
Barbara-based CKE, said Mary Gilbert, a senior analyst with Imperial
Capital in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   In its quarter ended Jan. 28, Carl's Jr. registered a 4.3%
increase in sales at outlets open at least one year. Same-store sales
jumped 6.4% at Hardee's, the biggest increase in more than five
years. CKE shares have appreciated by more than 250% in the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The company appears to have paid a price for its imitation. T.G.I.
Friday's sued Carl's Jr. last year for false, misleading
advertisements and unfair competition. The two companies recently
reached a confidential settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, Carl's Jr. has rolled out its newest premium product:
chicken-breast strips similar to those sold at KFC and, most
recently, McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   At least one burger chain has no intention of rejiggering its
menu. Closely held In-N-Out Burger, based in Irvine, has been serving
up burgers, fries and drinks the same way since its inception in
1948. Everything is made fresh to order. Restaurants have no freezers
or microwave ovens.</TE>
<TE>   In-N-Out's focus on and commitment to quality has created a
cult-like following, said Janet Lowder, a Rancho Palos Verdes
restaurant consultant. Analysts estimate that annual sales at the
164-store chain approach $263 million, or about $1.6 million per
unit, among the highest in the burger sector.</TE>
<TE>   "Our customers aren't looking for variety from us," said Carl Van
Fleet, a company vice president and general manager. "They're coming
for a Double Double and fries, and that's what we're giving them."</TE>

<HD>Decision Against Genentech Puts a Crimp in Biotech Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: The verdict doesn't pose a financial threat,
analysts say, but firm's shares drop 8.3%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genentech Inc. shares slid 8.3% on Tuesday, one day after a Los
Angeles County jury ordered it to pay $300.2 million in damages for
withholding royalties from City of Hope National Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   The bad news about South San Francisco-based Genentech helped drag
down biotechnology stocks. The Nasdaq biotechnology index fell 7.1%
and the Amex biotechnology index, another closely watched measure,
sank 8.1%.</LD>
<LD>   The sector also was hurt by disappointing news from Idec
Pharmaceuticals. The San Diego-based company said Monday that
Medicare reimbursement for a new cancer drug will come later than
expected and that it had halted development of a potential psoriasis
drug because of adverse side-effects. Idec skidded $6.34 to $32.03, a
decline of 17%, on Nasdaq on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Genentech, meanwhile, closed at $31.55, down $2.85, on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were unshaken by the jury award against Genentech, an
industry leader with revenue of $2.2 billion in 2001. They said it
did not pose a financial threat to the company, which, as of March
31, had $1 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance
sheet.</TE>
<TE>   A.G. Edwards analyst Alex Hittle said the compensatory damages
work out to 56 cents a share. He expects Genentech to earn 91 cents a
share in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors will return to court Monday to hear testimony on punitive
damages. City of Hope has not said how much it is seeking, except
that the amount will be substantial. Some analysts said they would
not be surprised if the hospital sought triple damages--twice the
compensatory amount.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan H&amp;Q biotechnology analyst David Molowa said it was
likely Genentech would appeal the verdict. The company said it would
wait until the punitive judgment before making its decision. But in
the past, executives said they expected the appeals process to extend
the case, filed in 1999, for several more years.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech could decide to settle the case with City of Hope to
avoid the cost and delay of an appeals process. The biotech company
in 1999 paid UC San Francisco $200 million to settle a patent
infringement case. But a settlement in the City of Hope case before
the jury reaches its decision on punitive damages is considered
unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   S.G. Cowan biotechnology analyst Eric Schmidt said the jury award
is a one-time event that won't affect the company's ability to
develop and market biotechnology drugs, including the cancer drug
Herceptin. "From a Wall Street perspective, this will not put
Genentech out of business," Schmidt said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is one biotechnology company that can write a check for
this, it is Genentech," said A.G. Edwards' Hittle.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, jurors found that Genentech owed Duarte-based City of
Hope royalties on drugs made by third parties under a 1976 contract.
Under the contract, Genentech funded research at City of Hope, which
gave the company patents on its discovery in exchange for a 2%
royalty on sales of resulting products.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope scientists Arthur Riggs and Keiichi Itakura
discovered a method to produce human proteins from bacteria, an
invention that launched the biotechnology industry.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech has paid City of Hope royalties on two biotechnology
drugs that resulted from the collaboration, human insulin and human
growth hormone. But the jury decided that the biotechnology company
hid licenses on other drugs, including interferon and hepatitis B
vaccine, to avoid paying the hospital royalties.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope general counsel Glenn Krinsky confirmed Tuesday that
the City of Hope scientists credited with the discovery would share
10% of the award.</TE>

<HD>Indexes Hit New Lows for the Year</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Drug and biotechnology stocks lead a broad
sell-off. Nasdaq sinks 2.2%, the Dow dips 1.3%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slumped Tuesday, wiping out an earlier rally and sending the
three major U.S. indexes to new lows for the year as more bad news
slammed the drug and biotechnology sectors.</LD>
<LD>   "After that patriotic, almost defiant rally in the fourth quarter
and earlier this year, reality is setting in," said Chris Orndorff,
head of equities at Payden &amp; Rygel in Los Angeles. "People are
starting to realize that the economy is not going to bounce back so
strongly, and they are adjusting their expectations down to a more
realistic level."</LD>
<LD>   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index finished below 1,500 for the
first time since Oct. 2, sinking 33.51 points, or 2.2%, to 1,497.18.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at its lowest since November,
sliding 128.14 points, or 1.3%, to 9,517.26. The broader Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index lost 1.7%, falling 17.14 points to 1,013.60, and is
at lows not seen since Sept. 26.</LD>
<TE>   More than three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New
York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say terrorism fears, corporate accounting scandals and
sluggish earnings have kept buyers on the sidelines. Tuesday's
reversal coincided with another suicide bombing attack in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, Nasdaq is down 23.2%; the S&amp;P is off 11.7%; and the
Dow, benefiting from its lower tech weighting, is down 5%. Smaller
stocks generally have held up better than the big indexes, but
Tuesday's losses knocked S&amp;P's small- and mid-cap indexes into the
red year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Several large drug makers paced Tuesday's broad sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott Labs dived $7.37 to $38.30 after cutting its 2002 profit
forecast. Abbott will take a one-time charge related to quality-
control problems at a plant and said sales of an anti-obesity drug
have been disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Merck sank $2.42 to $51.88 after saying it will wait until next
year to resubmit its application to the Food and Drug Administration
for approval of an arthritis drug. U.S.-traded shares of
GlaxoSmithKline lost $1.89 to $39.12 on reports that litigation might
be needed to resolve a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.</TE>
<TE>   IDEC Pharmaceuticals lost $6.34 to $32.03 on news that Medicare
won't cover its cancer drug Zevalin until October. Genentech dropped
$2.85 to $31.55 a day after jurors decided that it broke a gene
research contract and owes City of Hope $300 million in royalties.
The verdict prompted "more confusion about intellectual property
rights" in the sector, Orndorff said.</TE>
<TE>   On the day, the Amex biotech index plunged 8.1%.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Some telecom firms bucked the down trend after issuing positive
earnings forecasts. Nokia's U.S. shares rallied 55 cents to $12.55,
and Nextel Communications rose 63 cents to $4.42 after both said they
would meet targets.</TE>
<TE>   * But phone company AT&amp;T, the worst performer among the Dow
industrials during the last decade, fell 52 cents to $10.39 after
selling new stock to raise $2.52 billion. It was the stock's lowest
close since January 1991.</TE>
<TE>   * Brokerage stocks sagged as New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer,
who is investigating Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Salomon Smith
Barney, said he was finding conflicts of interest at firms other than
Merrill Lynch, which reached a $100-million settlement with Spitzer
in May. Morgan Stanley dropped $1.76 to $43.20 and Salomon's parent,
Citigroup, fell 99 cents to $40.71.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil prices ebbed to their lowest in eight weeks as industry
figures showed supplies holding at comfortable levels for summer
vacation drivers. July crude settled 17 cents lower at $24.12 a
barrel in New York trading, down 18% from eight-month highs near $30
a barrel in mid-May.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy stocks followed crude prices lower. Oil-field services
giant Schlumberger fell $1.38 to $46.87, and drilling servicer Baker
Hughes lost $1.46 to $33.48.</TE>
<TE>   * Xerox dropped 46 cents to $7.86 after Standard &amp; Poor's lowered
the company's debt rating to BB-minus from BB on concerns about debt
and cash flow.</TE>
<TE>   * Italian car maker Fiat rose 50 cents to $13 in New York trading
the day after its chief executive resigned.</TE>
<TE>   * Treasury yields eased as some investors sought the relative
safety of government bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note
fell to 4.97% from 5.03% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   * Among tech stocks, Intel lost 85 cents to $20.22, PMC-Sierra
skidded $1.80 to $10.84, Ciena dropped 35 cents to $4.62, and EMC
fell 24 cents to $6.98.</TE>

<HD>Mob Said to Have Threatened Actor</HD>
<DH>Courts: Steven Seagal is widely believed to be the murder
target in extortion case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN and ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Mafia captain who rules the Staten Island waterfront threatened
to kill an entertainment figure, identified previously as actor
Steven Seagal, as part of a multimillion-dollar extortion scheme,
federal prosecutors alleged Tuesday in court in Brooklyn.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony "Sonny" Ciccone "demanded millions of dollars from this
individual and threatened his life," Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew
Genser said at a court hearing for the accused Gambino family docks
boss, whose relatives and supporters wept and muttered from the
courtroom benches as he was ordered held without bail pending trial
on wide-ranging racketeering charges.</LD>
<LD>   Ciccone, 67, was among 17 alleged Gambino higher-ups, soldiers and
"associates" arrested last week under an indictment charging them
mostly with plots to exert influence over the local waterfronts and
the longshore workers union.</LD>
<TE>   But prosecutors said electronic surveillance in the case also
uncovered evidence that Ciccone and two others, including Seagal's
former producing partner, Julius R. "Jules" Nasso, were attempting to
extort money from an "entertainment figure."</TE>
<TE>   Nasso, 49, of Staten Island, had a 15-year business relationship
with Seagal until a bitter falling-out and filed a $60-million
lawsuit against the actor in March, alleging that the star of films
such as "Under Siege" had backed out of a contract to perform in four
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Nasso, who was freed last week on $1.5-million bond,
have called the extortion charges "absurd" and alleged that they are
Seagal's retaliation for the civil suit.</TE>
<TE>   But in court Tuesday, Genser and another federal prosecutor on the
case said that none of the victims in the case "came to the
government," and that all--presumably including Seagal--were
"reluctant" and frightened witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Genser also disclosed that secret recordings of conversations
between Ciccone and others, including Nasso, included talk of death
threats against the film figure.</TE>
<TE>   Ciccone is heard "admitting on tape he's been threatening to kill
this person ... there's a long discussion on tape," the prosecutor
said. "He's basically stating to the world what the motto is: 'Hey, I
get the money.' "</TE>
<TE>   The indictment does not name Seagal, or any other target of the
mob group, and prosecutors did not name him in court.</TE>
<TE>   But parties in the case have confirmed that the actor is the
alleged victim in two counts of the 68-count federal indictment
unsealed last week.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Nasso, who is charged with conspiracy to extort and
attempted extortion, said they have not heard the tapes and
questioned whether he was caught talking with the alleged mob captain
in a Staten Island restaurant, as prosecutors allege.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Ciccone, George Santangelo, dismissed partial
transcripts released so far--short portions of which were played in
court Tuesday--as vague and "hardly illuminating as to what they're
talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Though the indictment alleges many threats, it does not "show any
violence whatsoever" by Ciccone, Santangelo added, saying that the
New Jersey resident had "disassociated himself" from any involvement
with the mob a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleged that the extortion scheme against the
unnamed entertainment figure ran from September 2000 to last month
and involved "wrongful use of actual and threatened force, violence
and fear."</TE>
<TE>   Previously released documents alleged that Ciccone once was
overheard instructing Nasso to demand $150,000 per film from the
actor.</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion, Ciccone "excoriated Nasso" after hearing that
the producer had promised to share some of the extorted money with
others without "prior approval," prosecutors alleged.</TE>
<TE>   After listening to the short excerpts from the prosecution's tapes
Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate A. Simon Chrein ruled that Ciccone and his
alleged right-hand man, Primo Cassarino, would pose a danger if
released before trial.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have said that Ciccone became a "powerful captain" in
the mob family during the rule of John Gotti, the "Dapper Don" who
died Monday, then continued to serve under Gotti's brother Peter, who
also has been indicted in the current case.</TE>

<HD>Nextel, Nokia to Meet Profit Goals</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Investors take heart on the news and boost shares
of the wireless provider and the mobile-phone maker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The telecommunications industry got a badly needed dose of good news
Tuesday, with two of its biggest players reporting that they are on
course to meet profit goals.</LD>
<LD>   Nokia, the world's largest mobile-telephone maker, warned of lower
sales for its second quarter, but the company's shares gained as
investors took heart that Nokia was on course to hit its profit
target.</LD>
<LD>   And shares of Nextel Communications Inc. got a boost after the
nation's fifth-biggest wireless provider said it is poised to meet
fiscal 2002 financial targets.</LD>
<TE>   Finland-based Nokia told analysts during a much-anticipated
mid-quarter update on its finances that sales in its key mobile phone
unit would grow by only zero to 4%, less than half the 10% growth it
had signaled as recently as April.</TE>
<TE>   But investors cheered because the mobile telephone and network
gear supplier reaffirmed that it expects profit margins on handset
sales to remain above 20% in the second quarter--among the industry's
highest--and simultaneously gain market share.</TE>
<TE>   "Relative to where most of Wall Street were at, Nokia's statement
was a positive surprise," said Paul Sagawa, an analyst with
institutional brokerage Sanford Bernstein in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia shares initially fell as much as 9% after it warned of lower
second-quarter sales, saying they would fall 2% to 6% to $6.5 billion
to $6.8 billion, down from a previous target of as much as 7% growth.</TE>
<TE>   But Nokia stock, which has lost half of its value this year, later
rebounded to close 5.9% higher in Helsinki trading, recovering off
recent share-price lows not seen since late 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Nokia later gained as much as 10% in New York, but then
trimmed its gains somewhat to close only 4.6% higher in U.S. trading.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia is widely held by fund managers in Europe and the United
States, although the formerly highflying stock has lost its onetime
"must own" status among global investors.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and professional money managers said Nokia, which makes
more than one in three phones sold worldwide, had recovered its
momentum after seeing its industry-leading market share dip to 34.7%
during the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, a measure of cash flow, will be at least $2.5 billion,
and the company expects to add about 2 million subscribers from
domestic operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Reston, Va.-based company said it is achieving greater
operating efficiencies and margin improvement.</TE>
<TE>   If those trends continue, Nextel said, it probably will exceed its
2002 expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel, which is controlled by Craig McCaw, also noted that its
average monthly service revenue is tracking ahead of expectations for
the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent strength in monthly revenue, coupled with solid subscriber
additions, is driving excellent top-line growth in our business,"
said Paul Saleh, Nextel's executive vice president and chief
financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Nextel said it expected to generate about $2.5
billion in EBITDA for 2002 and add 2 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel shares gained 63 cents, or 16.6%, to $4.42 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters and Dow Jones/Associated Press were used in compiling this
report.</TE>

<HD>3 Firms Ordered to Pay Ex-Smoker $38 Million</HD>

<LD>A Florida jury ordered three tobacco companies to pay $37.5 million
in compensatory damages to an ex-smoker who is gravely ill with oral
and bladder cancer. But the award hinges on the upholding on appeal
of a record punitive damages verdict in a Florida class-action case.</LD>
<LD>   The jury in Miami ordered Philip Morris Cos., Brown &amp; Williamson
Tobacco Corp. and Liggett Group Inc. to pay the damages to John
Lukacs, 76, and his wife. Lukacs, a real estate lawyer, lost his
tongue to cancer and cannot speak.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors also found that Lukacs is entitled to a share of $144.8
billion in punitive damages that were awarded in the Engle
class-action case involving as many as 700,000 current and former
Florida smokers. The July 2000 verdict, which tobacco companies say
could bankrupt them, is moving slowly through appeals, and a ruling
is unlikely before next year.</LD>

<LD>Vegas Resort Probed Over Giveaway</LD>
<LD>   Nevada gaming regulators are investigating whether the Venetian
resort in Las Vegas rigged a promotional drawing by reportedly
handing a Mercedes-Benz as a consolation prize to a high roller who
had lost $5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Venetian informed the Nevada Gaming Control Board of the
possible misconduct a few weeks ago. If the allegations are true, the
Venetian could face a fine or have conditions placed on its gaming
license.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline is disputing Internal Revenue
Service allegations that it improperly avoided a significant portion
of the U.S. taxes on billions of dollars in sales of some drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The maker of the heartburn drug Zantac and other blockbusters
hasn't been formally charged by the IRS. The agency also hasn't said
how much the company might owe. IRS and British tax agency
representatives have been trying to resolve the issue, the company
said.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS alleged that Glaxo's U.S. subsidiary, GlaxoSmithKline
Holdings (Americas) Inc., overpaid its European parent for the drugs,
thereby artificially reducing its U.S. profit--and taxes--from 1989
through 1999.</LD>

Exchange.</TE>

<LD>St. John Knits International Inc., an Irvine designer of women's
clothing and accessories, reported net income of $7.3 million, or 89
cents a share, for its fiscal second quarter, unchanged from $7.3
million, or 93 cents a share, a year ago, hurt in part by increased
expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue declined 5% to $92.3 million for the quarter ended April
28 as an increase in sales at its stores failed to offset a decline
in wholesale sales, St. John Knits said. Sales at its full-price
stores rose 15% to $33.3 million, with sales at stores open at least
a year up 9.9%.</LD>
<LD>   The company operates 28 retail boutiques and 10 outlet apparel
stores as well as three home furnishing stores run through a wholly
owned subsidiary.</LD>
<TE>   St. John Knits shares closed unchanged at $36 in over-the-counter
trading. The earnings were announced after the markets closed.</TE>

<LD>Citigroup Inc. said it is reshuffling top management to centralize
global responsibility, but the latest changes left Wall Street
wondering who would take over as head of the No. 1 U.S. financial
services company.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup, which runs banking, brokerage and insurance operations
in 100 countries, named emerging markets head Victor Menezes a senior
vice chairman in charge of ties with top customers and regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Menezes, seen as a possible successor to Chairman and Chief
Executive Sanford Weill, also would head acquisitions and lead
recruiting efforts outside the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   Deryck Maughan would run a new regionally focused unit called
Citigroup International to oversee foreign business.</TE>
<TE>   The changes come as Wall Street analyzes Citigroup's not

<LD>Cargill Inc. said it will invest in a genetic cattle selection
process that should provide ranchers and feedlots with a means to
produce beef that is consistent in taste and tenderness.</LD>
<LD>   Caprock Cattle Feeders and meat packer Excel Corp., both units of
Cargill, will provide $10 million to Savage, Md.-based life sciences
company MetaMorphix Inc. to develop the genetic selection process,
the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   The selection system will rely on mapping of cattle genomes to
identify the meat-producing traits in cattle. Commercial use is still
several years away.</LD>

<HD>SEC Ponders New Rule Requiring Execs to 'Certify' Annual
Reports</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Under the proposal, CEOs and CFOs could be
subject to increased legal liability if their companies provide
misleading information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Executives whose companies give inaccurate or misleading
information to shareholders could face increased legal liability
under a rule being considered by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The rule would force chief executives and chief financial officers
to "certify" that quarterly and annual reports are truthful and
complete. The executives would have to sign a section of the reports
attesting to the accuracy of the information conveyed and to their
personal familiarity with it.</LD>
<LD>   The commission will vote today on whether to formally propose the
rule and put it out for public comment. The commission also will
consider a separate proposal that would force companies to quickly
divulge important information to investors.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed rules are among several that SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt
has advanced in the wake of the Enron Corp. collapse. Many companies
have been criticized for withholding key information from
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   If they are held directly accountable for corporate reports, CEOs
and CFOs could be exposed to heightened legal liability should
problems arise at their companies, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, executives who are challenged by securities regulators
or by aggrieved shareholders in lawsuits try to defend themselves by
saying they were not aware of the minutiae released to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Securities law experts pointed out that current laws already
require executives to release accurate and thorough information. But
the proposed rule would make it tougher for them to hide behind
claims of ignorance, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "It eliminates the 'I didn't know, I didn't realize, I didn't read
it' defense, not that that defense is credible in the first place,"
said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC attorney now at Smith Gambrell &amp;
Russell in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   During a February appearance before a congressional committee,
former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling said he didn't know key details
about controversial partnerships that led to his company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The rule could force CEOs to pay closer attention to what is
happening at their companies and to what shareholders have a right to
know, said Seth Taube, a securities attorney at McCarter &amp; English in
Newark, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a huge step, but it's an important step in motivating
management to recognize their responsibilities" to shareholders,
Taube said.</TE>
<TE>   The second proposal would affect the filing of 8-Ks, which are
forms companies use to notify investors about important news.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, six events, such as a change in a company's outside
accountant or the resignation of a director, require the filing of an
8-K within five to 15 days.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would add 13 events to the list of 8-K triggers. They
include the departure of top executives, the downgrading of a
company's bonds or the loss of important clients.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule also would mandate that the form be filed within two
days.</TE>

<HD>Conexant Accused of Stealing Name</HD>
<DH>Courts: Newport Beach company and its merger partner are
the target of an infringement lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A New Jersey software company has sued Conexant Systems Inc. and
Alpha Industries Inc. to block them from naming their merged wireless
semiconductor company Skyworks Solutions Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Skyworks Technologies Inc., a closely held developer of Web
promotional games, contends in a federal trademark-infringement suit
filed in Santa Ana that the companies are stealing its name.</LD>
<LD>   Alpha, based in Woburn, Mass., and the wireless business of
Conexant, based in Newport Beach, are expected to complete their
merger by Friday, and stock in the new company is expected to start
trading Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The suit says the plan to use the Skyworks name and the Internet
domain name skyworksinc.com will cause confusion among consumers and
hurt Skyworks Technologies' business.</TE>
<TE>   The Hackensack, N.J., company said its customers include Viacom
Inc.'s Comedy Central cable-television network, Kraft Foods Inc.,
PepsiCo Inc. and Ford Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Alpha and Conexant knew or should have known "their conduct was
likely to so mislead the public," the suit says. It accused Alpha and
Conexant of committing "fraud, oppression, malice and other such
conduct."</TE>
<TE>   The suit asks a judge to block Alpha and Conexant from using the
Skyworks name in connection with any "software, computer, Internet,
telecommunications, data transmission, wireless networks and related
fields" or from using an Internet address similar to that of Skyworks
Technologies. It also seeks monetary damages.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is similar to one that is pending against Philip
Morris Cos. The tobacco company wants to change its name to Altria
Group Inc., and a closely held venture-capital firm named Altira
Group is seeking to block that change.</TE>
<TE>   Alpha Chief Executive David Aldrich said in an interview last
month that he didn't believe a "reasonable person" would confuse the
mobile-phone chip business of Skyworks Solutions with the promotional
games business of Skyworks Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Alpha shares rose 85 cents to $6.75, while shares of Conexant fell
22 cents to $4.78, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Toyota Taking to the Air</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Auto giant aims to make a simple-to-fly plane
that would become as common as the car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prototype of a single-engine aircraft designed and developed by
Toyota Motor Corp. made its first flight last month, raising eyebrows
within the aviation industry as Japan's largest auto manufacturer
signaled it was making a significant move forward with its long-held
but little-known plans to build light airplanes.</LD>
<LD>   The short flight, which took place May 31 at Kern County's Mojave
Airport, marked a major turning point for Toyota's ambitious goal of
building airplanes that would be as simple to fly as driving a car,
cost significantly less than the current generation of private
airplanes and eventually be as ubiquitous as the automobile.</LD>
<LD>   "They've had a long-term view that a general aviation airplane
would be the Toyota car of the future," said Jon B. Kutler, president
of the aerospace investment bank that has advised the manufacturer.
"They pride themselves in looking 100 years down the line and they
see general aviation as a future."</LD>
<TE>   But the program, the bulk of which has been spearheaded by
Toyota's U.S. operations in the South Bay, has remained out of the
limelight even to observers of the general aviation industry, many of
whom were unaware that Toyota has been quietly developing the plane.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that Toyota executives have been unusually coy about
disclosing any details of the aircraft program. Although the company
acknowledged that a test flight did occur, a spokesman refused to
divulge details.</TE>
<TE>   After initially refusing to talk about the program, a spokesman
confirmed that 40 aerospace engineers, hired away from some of major
aerospace concerns such as Boeing Co. and Raytheon Co., have been
working on the aircraft for at least four years.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing we are saying is that we did indeed conduct a test
flight," said Xavier Dominicis, a spokesman for Toyota Motor Sales
USA, whose Aviation Business Development Office in Long Beach is
overseeing the project. "We are studying the potential for a
single-engine piston plane but there is not a lot we can say."</TE>
<TE>   Toyota engineers in the South Bay area designed the aircraft and
Scaled Composites, a Mojave company founded by legendary aircraft
designer Burt Rutan, assembled the prototype and is testing it at
Mojave Airport. Scaled Composites forwarded telephone calls about the
aircraft to Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   But Rutan made references to the aircraft at a recent university
lecture, calling it "the aeronautical equivalent of the Lexus LS400."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Toyota attempted to develop an aviation
version of the Lexus engine. But the project was shelved amid the
downturn in the general aviation industry. It was unclear whether
Toyota was still pursuing a derivative engine for the prototype
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Although Toyota officials were downplaying the program, former
company Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda acknowledged last month that Toyota
was seriously considering building small private airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Business Times in Singapore, Toyoda, whose
father founded the company, said that although "our main business
will still be automotive-based, we are studying the opportunities"
for a light aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.S., there are 200,000 propeller planes, many of them
aging," Toyoda told the newspaper, explaining that the U.S. would be
the target market if Toyota was to begin making the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Aerospace analysts said it wasn't surprising that Toyota would
want to target the U.S., because it is the world's largest market for
private airplanes, many of which are more than three decades old. The
average age of a four-seat, single-engine piston airplane, the type
that Toyota is considering, is 32 years, according to the General
Aviation Manufacturers Assn. There are 150,000 single-engine aircraft
in operation, most of which are owned privately and would have to be
replaced in the next decade or so.</TE>
<TE>   "If Toyota can bring the quality and production skills to general
aviation, they are going to have a very good place in the market,"
said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group Inc., a aerospace
research firm in Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>   But Toyota faces difficult challenges, most significantly the
widely fluctuating demand.</TE>
<TE>   After peaking at about 14,000 a year in 1977, sales of
single-engine aircraft plunged to less than 500 by 1994, as
manufacturers left the market amid a flurry of crash-related
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   With legislation that provided some liability protection, sales of
the aircraft began to rise again and reached 1,810 in 2000 before
falling a bit in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Textron
Inc.'s Cessna unit, for instance, resumed building its popular 172
piston engine model in 1997 after the product's 11-year hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts believe the market eventually will return to general
aviation's heyday of the 1970s, which could provide a lucrative
setting for Toyota's aviation ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of market conditions, Kutler said, building a simpler
and cheaper airplane won't be Toyota's biggest challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "You can make a plane that is as easy to fly as to drive a car but
what breaks down is that it's a lot harder to get a flying license
than a car license," Kutler said, adding that fewer people are
learning to fly as the glamour of flight has dimmed since the early
years of the Space Age.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Toyota envisions an airplane constructed mostly of
composite materials that would cost about the same as a high-end
Lexus, somewhat above $50,000. That would be a fraction of the cost
of current private airplanes, with starting price tags of about
$150,000. It also would entail less maintenance and be as reliable as
one of its sedans.</TE>

<HD>Univision to Acquire Hispanic Broadcasting</HD>
<DH>Media: Los Angeles-based firm's $3.5-billion stock deal for
the nation's largest Spanish-language radio network would round out
its portfolio.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Univision Communications Inc. is acquiring the nation's largest
Spanish-language radio network, Dallas-based Hispanic Broadcasting
Corp., in a $3.5-billion stock deal that would round out its
portfolio as a media conglomerate, sources close to the transaction
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Univision commands more than 70% of the
Spanish-language TV market and owns three record labels but before
this deal had no voice in radio. Hispanic Broadcasting owns 55 radio
stations, including five in Los Angeles, the nation's largest Latino
market.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which could be announced as early as today, bolsters the
company's growing music division by giving Univision artists valuable
exposure and air time on popular radio stations in the nation's top
Latino markets.</LD>
<TE>   "Now Univision can truly be a one-stop shop," said a source close
to the deal who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other Spanish-language company that offers this range
of media platforms."</TE>
<TE>   Univision executives declined to comment. Hispanic Broadcasting
executives could not be reached late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed purchase price carries a premium of more than 25%
above Hispanic Broadcasting's market value of $2.6 billion. Hispanic
Broadcasting shares closed at $24.45, up 70 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Univision shares closed at $37.70, down $1.35, on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the acquisition, which should close by the end of
the year, Hispanic Broadcasting shares will be exchanged for .85
shares of Univision common stock.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders for both companies must approve the deal, but
approval is probable because Univision Chairman A. Jerrold Perenchio
controls more than 60% of Univision's voting stock.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hispanic Broadcasting's two largest shareholders, radio
giant Clear Channel Communications Inc. of San Antonio and the family
of Hispanic Broadcasting Chairman and Chief Executive McHenry
Tichenor Jr., have pledged to vote for the deal, according to a
source.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic Broadcasting, which has more than 1,100 employees, will
be renamed Univision Radio and its headquarters will remain in Dallas
with Tichenor staying on to head up the new division.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic Broadcasting has five radio stations in Los Angeles: news
and talk station KTNQ-AM (1020); regional music station KSCA-FM
(101.9); adult contemporary station KLVE-FM (107.5); and two Spanish
oldies stations: KRCD-FM (98.3) and KRCV-FM (103.9). The acquisition
will give Univision overlapping media properties in the nation's top
10 Latino markets. Univision will control the No. 1 Spanish-language
TV station and No. 1 Spanish-language radio stations in Los Angeles,
Miami and Houston. And in New York and Chicago, the nation's other
large Latino markets, Univision will own the No. 1 TV station and the
No. 2 radio station.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition also will give Univision more reach on the
Internet. Although Univision has the leading Spanish-language Web
site, Univision.com, Hispanic Broadcasting runs its own network of
community focused bilingual Web sites called Netmio.com.</TE>
<TE>   Univision's last major acquisition came in December, when the
company purchased Los Angeles-based record label Fonovisa in a
$240-million stock deal with Mexico's Grupo Televisa.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the company has been looking for new platforms to
promote the label's musicians including music video programs on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Univision owns more than 50 television stations and in January
launched its second broadcast network, TeleFutura, built with more
than 13 USA Broadcasting stations that Univision acquired from Barry
Diller's company for $1.1 billion. The company also manages a cable
channel, Galavision.</TE>
<TE>   Univision expects the deal to contribute to cash flow in the first
year after the acquisition, according to the source. Existing
Univision shareholders would hold 73.5% of the company's shares after
the merger and Hispanic Broadcasting shareholders 26.5%</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs Unocal Abuse Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Foreign workers accuse company of human rights
violations in Myanmar. The case, being closely watched, would set
precedent for multinational firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Burmese refugees won a landmark victory Tuesday when a Los
Angeles judge ruled that Unocal Corp. could be tried for human rights
violations, including forced labor, that allegedly occurred during
construction of a $1.2-billion natural gas pipeline in Myanmar.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Victoria Gerrard Chaney's ruling means that
if the case goes to trial in September as scheduled, Unocal would
become the first U.S. corporation held to answer in an American
courtroom foreigners' allegations of such abuse abroad.</LD>
<LD>   "In many ways this is a historic decision," said Dan Stormer, a
Los Angeles lawyer representing the plaintiffs.</LD>
<TE>   The case is being closely watched in business and legal circles
because of its implications for other multinational corporations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to open up a whole new way of looking at what the
responsibility of U.S. corporations is when they are dealing abroad,"
said Carole Basri, director of the New York chapter of the American
Corporate Counsel Assn. and a University of Pennsylvania corporate
law instructor. "It's going to have a tremendous impact."</TE>
<TE>   Unocal contends the suit is baseless--part of a politically
motivated campaign to embarrass the El Segundo-based company into
divesting its holdings in the nation formerly known as Burma. It is
the last major U.S. firm with dealings in Myanmar since its military
leaders seized power after free elections in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal is not being tried for direct liability for the alleged
human rights abuses but for so-called vicarious liability.</TE>
<TE>   "Unocal's actions are not at issue in this case," said spokesman
Barry Lane. "The case centers around the actions of the Myanmar
military, and that's where you come up with the vicarious liability.
We're party to a contract with the government of Myanmar, and the
military is part of the government of Myanmar; therefore, we are
responsible for it. That's the rationale for this lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs are 14 former residents of Burmese villages in the
path of the pipeline, which was completed in 1998 to transport
natural gas from an offshore field through Myanmar to Thailand. The
villagers, who now are living in Thai refugee camps, allege that
Myanmar soldiers forced them to work on the pipeline project, in some
cases kidnapping and raping them.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal, which describes itself as a pipeline investor, has
acknowledged the history of human rights abuses in Myanmar but denies
any corporate connection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very well documented," Lane said. "But there is no evidence
showing our participation or our solicitation to get this to occur,
or that we benefited from it."</TE>
<TE>   The villagers initially filed suit in federal court but lost their
bid for a trial when the judge determined there was insufficient
evidence that Unocal participated in the alleged abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the facts have really changed," Lane said. "We're
confident that when this case does come to trial, once again it will
be proven that Unocal had no role in any of these activities, as came
out in the federal case."</TE>
<TE>   With an appeal of the dismissal of the federal case pending, the
villagers filed a second suit in state court.</TE>
<TE>   If they prove their case, they could ask for damages and demand
that Unocal give up profit from the pipeline, which, based on Unocal
documents obtained in the course of litigation, could be $60 million,
Stormer said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's before we address damages and before punitive damages," he
said. "The judge's ruling allows us to look at damages in the
hundreds of millions of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Collingsworth, director of the Center for International
Labor Rights Fund, filed the first lawsuit in 1996 as part of a legal
campaign to force multinational corporations to improve their conduct
abroad. He has a few cases pending, but none has come so near to a
trial.</TE>
<TE>   As the Unocal case progressed over the last two years,
Collingsworth said investment fund managers called for updates to
determine how great a risk it posed for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "When we filed the Unocal suit six years ago, all these companies
said, 'Oh, this is crazy--there's no way you can hold us liable,' "
Collingsworth said. "The fund managers didn't feel there was enough
to take account of. Now they can't say we're nuts anymore. With the
right set of facts, we can take a company to trial."</TE>
<TE>   The case has the potential to force change in corporate conduct,
said Christine Rosen, an associate professor at UC Berkeley's Haas
School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very significant in the sense that if they are held liable,
it means that companies are going to be held by the courts to the
same standards that they are held to in this country," she said. "And
companies will not be able to go abroad and take advantage of the
much looser regulatory environment or the corruption of the
government to treat their workers in an inhumane way."</TE>

<HD>WellPoint Shares Jump on Boosted Earnings Outlook</HD>
<DH>Health care: Large California insurer raises its 2002
forecast on stronger-than-expected growth in enrollment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of WellPoint Health Networks Inc. soared Tuesday and lifted
other health insurance stocks after the company boosted its profit
outlook for the year because of stronger-than-expected growth in
health plan membership.</LD>
<LD>   WellPoint, one of California's biggest health insurers, also said
it's benefiting from declining administrative costs.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of WellPoint were up $5.80, or 7.4%, to $83.75, making it
one of the leading percentage gainers on the New York Stock Exchange
as it hit an all-time high. Shares of Cobalt Corp., the Blue
Cross/Blue Shield licensee for Wisconsin, rose $2.24, or more than
11%, to $22.34 on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said there are signs that health insurance providers,
seeking to protect profits, are not willing to cut premiums to
attract new customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've got a sustainable period here of very solid
earnings growth, and that will continue," said UBS Warburg analyst
William McKeever. "I think the industry has changed to the point
where companies are not going to be fighting for market share."</TE>
<TE>   McKeever raised his price target on shares of WellPoint, the
largest Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance provider, to $96 from $88
and reiterated a "strong buy" on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Securities analyst David Shove increased his price
target on WellPoint to $90 from $72 and raised earnings estimates for
the company, but he maintained a "hold" rating on the stock, citing
potential litigation.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint said late Monday that it was raising its earnings
guidance for 2002 to $4.30 a share from $4, with earnings in each of
the last three quarters about 10 cents a share higher than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Membership in its health plans probably will increase in "the high
single-digit range" for the year, compared with its earlier forecast
of 5% to 7% growth, the Thousand Oaks-based company said. In
California, membership growth is expected to hit 10.5%.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint has added customers in California and Georgia by
offering health plans that give members a choice of doctors and a
range of co-payments for medical care and prescription drugs. The
company also is benefiting from its purchase of rival Blue Cross and
Blue Shield insurers to expand in the Midwest and Southeast over the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also bid up share prices for the other publicly traded
Blue Cross and Blue Shield franchisees, with many hitting 52-week
highs during the day's trading.</TE>
<TE>   Anthem Inc., a Blue Cross/Blue Shield franchisee with more than 8
million members, rose 55 cents to $73.12 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Trigon Healthcare Inc., the remaining publicly traded Blue
Cross/Blue Shield franchisee, rose 85 cents to $107 on the NYSE. The
company announced a deal to sell itself to Anthem on April 29.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P Managed Health Care index was up 2.85% to 228.55,
bolstered by having all five of its components up at least 0.77%.
Aetna Inc., Humana Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc., Cigna Corp. and
WellPoint are the index components. The index is up a whopping 32.7%
this year, compared with a 9.61% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index.</TE>

<HD>Woody Allen's Suit Against Former Partner Settled</HD>
<DH>Courts: Filmmaker had accused producer Jean Doumanian of
cheating him of earnings. Terms were not disclosed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH and RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Woody Allen and his former producing partner, Jean Doumanian, reached
an out-of-court settlement late Tuesday, ending an ugly and at times
highly personal dispute between the filmmaker and his longtime friend
and associate.</LD>
<LD>   Allen last May sued Doumanian and her production company,
Sweetland Films, as well as Sweetland producer Jacqui Safra, accusing
them of cheating him of earnings on eight films and seeking $12
million he said he was owed.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's surprise settlement came after several bruising days of
testimony in which Justice Ira Gammerman outright rejected
Doumanian's main defense. New York newspapers ridiculed her
performance on the stand, with the New York Daily News going so far
as to dub the stylish producer a character out of "Dumb and Dumber."</LD>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Allen and Doumanian, a close friend of nearly
40 years, had agreed to go into business together. In the initial
written contract, which covered the films "Bullets Over Broadway,"
"Mighty Aphrodite" and "Everyone Says I Love You," Allen, Doumanian
and Safra had agreed to share both the losses and the profits from
all three films.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the trio decided to make more films together. Doumanian
and Safra later argued that their original agreement to share in the
losses and profits extended to the subsequent films, a contention
that the judge rejected on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   While the domestic grosses on Allen's films have fallen off
considerably in the last decade, some of his films have remained
profitable because of his popularity in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The judge, who had been urging both sides to settle the case,
brought the competing lawyers into his chambers Friday and again
Tuesday. During what was supposed to be a five-minute recess late
Tuesday, the lawyers huddled with the judge and emerged about 50
minutes later with a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Doumanian had been expected to take the stand again.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, the two sides issued a joint statement
saying only that "the parties have reached a business resolution of
their dispute."</TE>
<TE>   Allen's lead attorney, Michael Zweig, added: "The plaintiffs are
happy."</TE>
<TE>   Doumanian would not comment. Her attorney, Peter Parcher, was
unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   Allen also declined to comment. He spent the evening in Brooklyn
filming his latest movie, which stars Jason Biggs and Christina
Ricci.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit brought a bitter demise to what had been a long
friendship.</TE>
<TE>   In happier times, Allen and Doumanian talked every day on the
phone, dined constantly at the New York celebrity restaurant Elaine's
and traveled the world together on a private jet.</TE>
<TE>   Doumanian was one of five people to attend Allen's wedding to
actress Louise Lasser in 1966 and in 1992 Allen even saved her life
by performing the Heimlich maneuver on her after she began choking at
a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed films that followed the original three were
"Deconstructing Harry," "Wild Man Blues," "Celebrity," "Sweet and
Lowdown" and "Small Time Crooks."</TE>
<TE>   In two days of testimony, Allen spent much of the time sparring
with Doumanian's lawyer, who tried to get him to agree that the last
series of pictures he did for her were covered by the same financial
rules that governed their initial three-movie deal.</TE>
<TE>   Allen got a $2.5-million fee for his typically wide-ranging role
on each film--as writer, director and often the star--and shared in
50% of the profits.</TE>
<TE>   What divided the two sides was whether profits from the final
films should be calculated one by one or as a group--so that Allen's
extra take from a movie that was successful at the box office would
be diminished by losses on others.</TE>
<TE>   Allen testified that he at first had hoped he and Doumanian could
remain good friends even as he took her to court, but by the time of
the trial the case had become a somber matter for both.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while Allen tried to remain all business on the stand, others
in the lower Manhattan courtroom were more carried away by the
theater of the proceeding, playing to the celebrity plaintiff and
even going for laughs.</TE>
<TE>   During the filmmaker's first hour on the stand, Allen frequently
tried to explain his answers in detail, and at one point began
explaining how he had "a film crew out now, shooting on the streets
of New York," prompting the judge to say, "That's enough."</TE>
<TE>   "Stop talking?" Allen asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop talking," Gammerman responded. "I'll do the directing."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone duped online press-release service Internet Wire on Monday
into publishing a phony release about Cel-Sci Corp. (ticker symbol:
CVM), causing at least a short-lived jump in the tiny drug company's
stock. The release has since been retracted.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Internet Wire nor Cel-Sci knows who's behind the false
release. Both firms said they've referred the matter to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   The incident is reminiscent of the highly publicized case in 2000
in which a hoaxer drove shares of Costa Mesa-based Emulex Corp.
(EMLX) lower by getting Internet Wire to distribute a false negative
release about the company. After that incident, Internet Wire vowed
to tighten its security to assure that all its releases were genuine.</LD>
<TE>   Internet Wire said Tuesday that the failure of one of its
employees to follow procedures strictly allowed the bogus release to
slip through. The firm defended its procedures, and said it was
frustrating that it had been victimized despite the procedures, which
include authenticating phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The Cel-Sci release, which Internet Wire published early Monday
morning, purported to announce an important partnership that would
have provided a financial windfall for Vienna, Va.-based Cel-Sci.</TE>
<TE>   The release boosted Cel-Sci's stock Monday to 31 cents a share
from 29 cents on the American Stock Exchange; the stock went as high
as 37 cents during the day. Trading volume was 1.3 million shares,
more than five times the average volume for Cel-Sci.</TE>
<TE>   But the substance of the release was untrue. Geert Kersten,
Cel-Sci's chief executive, said the partnership described in the
bogus release doesn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   Cel-Sci's stock was unchanged Tuesday at 31 cents.</TE>

<HD>Bertelsmann to Acquire Rest of Zomba Music for $3 Billion</HD>
<DH>Media: The world's top independent label will add artists
such as 'N Sync to the German firm's lineup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERISSA MARR</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Zomba Music, the U.S. creative powerhouse that has churned out stars
from Britney Spears to 'N Sync, said Tuesday it was selling out to
German media group Bertelsmann in a deal worth close to $3 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Cashing in on an agreement that could boost Bertelsmann's BMG
music arm into the world's top three music giants, Zomba exercised an
option to sell BMG the shares it does not already own in its leading
independent business.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to pop princess Britney, Zomba will add acts such as
the Backstreet Boys, crooner Michael Bolton and rapper Mystikal as
well as a library including blues legend Buddy Guy to BMG's roster.
But it comes at a hefty price.</LD>
<TE>   BMG, currently last among the world's five major music groups
whose own artists include pop stars Alicia Keys and Pink, already
owns 25% of Zomba's music publishing division and 20% of its record
division. Bertelsmann said in its recent annual report Zomba's option
was worth some $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "While the exercise of this option will undoubtedly be a surprise
to many in the music industry, this is a natural culmination of many
years of close business ties and a complex series of agreements
negotiated 12 years ago," Zomba's chief and founder Clive Calder said
in a joint statement with Bertelsmann.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the boom in the 1990s, Calder agreed the "put"
option to sell the remainder of Zomba to BMG some time this year.
Calder's decision to exercise that option immediately raised
questions over whether he would stay at the company he founded and
which now ranks as the top independent music house.</TE>
<TE>   Calder, 55, has been key to Zomba's success since setting up the
company in 1975, playing a large role in discovering and developing
its top acts signed to labels such as Jive and Mojo.</TE>
<TE>   While figures for Zomba are not made public, it has some of the
best margins in the industry. Analysts estimate it makes a profit of
around $300 million on $1 billion in sales.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, BMG has historically suffered some of the lowest
margins after years of management in-fighting, a dearth of hits and
monster losses. But it has started to show signs of a turnaround
after a radical shake-up last year.</TE>
<TE>   BMG said it was not immediately clear where it would rank among
the top five music majors after the acquisition, especially given a
lack of global data on the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate BMG had an 11% global market share in 2000,
ranking last after EMI with 12%, Warner Music with 13%, Sony with 16%
and Universal Music with 22%. Meanwhile, analysts estimate Zomba had
a global market share of 5%.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, I have admired Zomba's impressive results, which
are perhaps the most spectacular in the industry. We are very excited
about its future prospects and it will definitely strengthen our
music business," Bertelsmann chief Thomas Middelhoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts suggested that the Zomba deal would limit
Bertelsmann's ability to do long sought-after deals in publishing and
television empire.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann has been sitting on a $6.75-billion cash pile from the
sale of a savvy investment in AOL Europe, but will have spent a large
part of that buying out a partner in pan-European broadcaster RTL
Group as well as Zomba.</TE>
<TE>   To help fund the Zomba acquisition, Bertelsmann said last week it
was planning to raise up to 1 billion euros in a bond.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies made no mention of a price for Zomba in their
statement. However, Bertelsmann said in its annual report the
$3-billion price tag would be verified by due diligence.</TE>
<TE>   A $3-billion price is equivalent to the market value of EMI which
had once planned to join forces with BMG before regulators made clear
they would not put up with a merger.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Let me be the first on my block to squawk about a coming nuisance
that will make our weary days more insufferable.</LD>
<LD>   If urban life isn't struggle enough, just wait.</LD>
<LD>   Background: As a people, we Americans are too fat and sedentary.
Maybe you saw the recent report from the scientists at Rand. They
found that public health-care costs stemming from obesity surpass the
toll taken by cigarettes.</LD>
<TE>   Personally, I no longer avail myself of valet parking at pubs and
restaurants, except in emergencies. That way I get regular exercise.
Besides, walking in the beach villages of Southern California is one
of the distinct pleasures of life here, what with all the starlets in
bikinis and the playful kids and the dogs and the surfers and old
folks holding hands.</TE>
<TE>   Not for long, though.</TE>
<TE>   Forget walking. We're now going to Segway. Or at least some people
are. And that's apt to pretty much ruin the idea of city strolling
for the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   You've seen this Segway. The motorized, electric, self-balancing
"human transporter" that looks like a witch's broomstick with wheels,
or maybe a rolling pogo stick without the bounce. It's the
coming-soon, gotta-have-it marketing nightmare dreamed up, as the
inventors say, so we can "move quicker/carry more." Great.</TE>
<TE>   So beep-beep, on-your-left and get out of my way. Oops, sorry. You
hurt badly?</TE>
<TE>   Something else to add to our inventory of cars, trucks, RVs,
personal watercraft, snowmobiles, dune buggies, ski boats, Cessnas,
lawn tractors and motorcycles. I haven't seen hype like this since
Nike started selling air in its gym shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The Segway is a breakthrough in one crucial regard: It will bring
motorized vehicles onto the sidewalks. It's built to race down the
walkways at 12 mph, which is about 12 times as fast as I like to
stroll and three times as fast as your most determined power walker.</TE>
<TE>   Our last urban redoubt is about to be invaded by the motorheads.
We've seen what a half-bright teenager can do with a skateboard. Give
them six months with the Segway and politicians will be proposing
legislation to mandate the wearing of safety helmets for any
pedestrian who dares set foot on a sidewalk. Wait till messenger
services get a hold of these and soup them up. Sidewalk rage.</TE>
<TE>   Segways won't be offered to the general public for a few months
yet, until the marketing department finishes driving consumers into
fits of desire. So far, the plan seems to be working just fine. When
Amazon auctioned off the first three of these machines in March,
someone in Texas paid $160,100 for Segway HT No. 1--about 50 times
the anticipated retail cost.</TE>
<TE>   Segway Chief Executive Dean Kamen could barely contain himself at
the sight of the "frenzy," as he called it.</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt that the Segway folks are a clever bunch. Never
mind that the U.S. Postal Service is awash in bottomless debt, it
still bit on the hype and managed to come up with cash to test out a
fleet of Segways.</TE>
<TE>   Bang, crunch. Oops. Too bad about that coffee all over your dress.</TE>
<TE>   We'll be teaching our kids that it's no longer safe to get to the
crosswalk.</TE>
<TE>   The Segway weighs 70 pounds and carries riders up to 250 pounds. I
did some computations. A direct hit will flatten you as sure as a
fridge dropped out of a second-floor apartment. And that's just for
starters. We know where the trend will take us next. People will need
to upgrade to SUV-sized Segways. For safety's sake.</TE>
<TE>   So why allow them? Did I mention these Segway folks are clever?
Before Segways are released to us, the flabby masses, the company is
going state by state to secure new laws to permit Segways on
sidewalks. So far, according to published reports, they have been
successful in 23 states. The California Legislature has such a bill
under consideration, as does Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Segway riders will have "rights" before they have Segways.</TE>
<TE>   PR propaganda put out by inventors say the name Segway was chosen
because it sounds like the word "segue," which means transition. From
a society that doesn't walk enough to one that doesn't walk at all, I
guess.</TE>
<TE>   These Barnum &amp; Bailey promoters would have us believe the Segway
"transforms a person into an empowered pedestrian."</TE>
<TE>   For those us of left un-powered, I suppose it's going to be a
carton of Pall Malls and tubs of buttered popcorn on the sofa. At
least it will be safer than the sidewalks.</TE>

<AU>MARK BOWDEN</AU>
<BD>Mark Bowden is the author of "Black Hawk Down"
(Atlantic Monthly Press, 1999) and "Killing Pablo" (Atlantic Monthly
Press, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I went to the Boston Phoenix's Web site last week and read its
argument for linking readers to the full video of Daniel Pearl's
murder. I clicked on the link and watched as Pearl spoke into the
camera, acknowledging his Jewishness and other things. Everything was
blacked out except Pearl's head. It was clear that his remarks were
edited and made under duress, so they were not his own.</LD>
<LD>   Then I turned it off. I didn't have the heart or stomach to watch
the rest. I know what happens. His throat is slit and his head is cut
off. Even if I hadn't known that already, the Phoenix decorated the
article on its Web site with a picture of Pearl's severed head being
held aloft.</LD>
<LD>   It filled me with disgust, the act, the video and the newspaper's
decision to help make it available. Let's take them one at a time.</LD>
<TE>   The act was a crime, deeply cruel, that was primarily intended to
spread fear. The video is designed to make the killers' handiwork
public, which helps spread fear and which the killers presumably hope
will recruit eager Islamists to their cause.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the world is considerably more depraved than I imagine, it
can only backfire in this latter attempt. Surely even those opposed
to U.S. policy and our way of life are still human enough to be
repulsed by such a display. When I was in Mogadishu in 1997, I met
many Somalis who confessed horror and embarrassment at the fact (also
captured on film) that angry mobs of their countrymen had dragged the
dead bodies of U.S. soldiers through the streets after the 1993
battle of Mogadishu.</TE>
<TE>   At least that was done in anger, after many hundreds of Somalis
had been killed. The video of Pearl's execution inhabits a darker
realm of depravity. It is calculated, crafted like a work of art.
Which is what makes the Phoenix's decision to feature it so wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Decisions about whether to show images of atrocity are always
difficult ones for the press. Pictures, especially moving pictures,
are often more powerful than words. I had read many times the stories
of brave young idealists who opposed the Nazis in the years before
World War II, but no words ever stirred me as much as a sequence of
photographs in the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans showing the
hangings of two, a young man and woman. The look of stoical defiance
on their faces in the moments before their deaths is a study in moral
courage.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the terrible images of dead Americans being dragged
through the streets of Mogadishu conveyed better than any story how
the American humanitarian effort in Somalia had gone disastrously
awry.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding whether to use such images is an exercise in judgment and
taste. In modern times, everything gets published or broadcast
somewhere. Overall, it's a boon to mankind that technology has made
it impossible to control information. It's also a good thing that
anyone with access to a computer and modem can disseminate their
ideas and their art. But along with the best of human expression, it
also invites the worst.</TE>
<TE>   What the Internet lacks, by definition, is editing. Since there is
no filter, there is no judgment and no taste. The Internet is where
you can find anything.</TE>
<TE>   I agreed with CBS' decision last month to air an edited portion of
the Pearl murder video, because the fact that it had been made and
posted on the Internet by his killers was news. It revealed much
about the character of our nation's enemies. But CBS stopped short of
showing Pearl's final humiliating moments, and his beheading.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing honest about the video. It is not made by a
journalist, but a propagandist. Pearl's final words were scripted by
his killers, and the images on the video are edited to convey only
the message they intend, a narrow focus on horror and gore, like an
extreme close-up in a porn flick. It makes sense only as a form of
sick shock entertainment, and it puts the Phoenix in the same league
as the old tabloids that published gory crime-scene photographs. This
video was already out there on the Internet for anyone determined
enough to find it. All the Phoenix did was shine a light on it.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question of the paper's right to do so. Even if we
wanted to censor the video, we could not.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Americans get Al Jazeera, the Arab cable news station,
in their living rooms. The computer is even more democratic. I knew
the moment I learned there was a video of Pearl's murder that it
would eventually be available on the Internet. But that alone doesn't
mean it's important to watch it.</TE>

<HD>Panic Is a Worse Enemy Than 'Dirty' Bombs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSE GOTTEMOELLER</AU>
<BD>Rose Gottemoeller, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, was deputy undersecretary of
Energy for defense nuclear nonproliferation during the Clinton
administration.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty years ago, when I was growing up in Dearborn, Mich., there was
a billboard on the main road near my house. It showed a happy family
gathered around their father as he cheerily read a newspaper in a
comfortable chair. "Let us build your bomb shelter for you," the
billboard read. "So many uses in peacetime! Dad's den! Mom's sewing
room!"</LD>
<LD>   Many people remember the "duck and cover" drills at school. In my
third-grade class, they came in two varieties: out into hallway, sit
down, back to lockers, head between knees; or, under desk, curl up,
forehead to floor. About the time of the Cuban missile crisis in
1962, we abandoned such measures. As the threat of nuclear holocaust
came dangerously near, homeland defense seemed paltry and
ineffective. Nothing was going to stop massive death and injury if
Soviet nuclear weapons rained down on us. "Go home," the nuns said
simply during the worst days of that October crisis. "You should be
with your parents if anything happens."</LD>
<LD>   Today, we need to examine homeland defense efforts again, not
because the situation is hopeless but because it can be managed. It
became clear, when the FBI announced seizing a man bent on
radiological attack on a U.S. city, that this country faces a renewed
threat from weapons that use the destructive power of the atom.</LD>
<TE>   This threat is different from the massive nuclear exchange that we
feared in the Cold War. Far from the wholesale destruction of a
nuclear explosion, so-called dirty bombs produce immediate casualties
only from the conventional explosion that sets them off. Over time,
depending on the radiation that they spread as a result of the
explosion, some people might sicken and eventually die. But this is
not a given, especially if early steps are taken to inform the
population, keep them out of harm's way and clean up the radiation.</TE>
<TE>   The enemy in this case is widespread panic and the impact on
economic activity, not nuclear explosive effects. For that reason,
the homeland defense measures that we stress today should revolve
around two major activities: educating the public and cleaning up
rapidly. People need to know that a dirty bomb attack does not
require them to put the children in the car and rush out of town.</TE>
<TE>   The public needs to know that even those caught near a
radiological explosion will probably suffer no lasting effects and
that decontamination can be simple and quick.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning up an urban area after it is hit by a radiological bomb
is complicated but by no means impossible. Some buildings may be
difficult to reopen and may eventually have to be razed. This result,
however, is not a given and depends greatly on the health effects of
the material used in the device.</TE>
<TE>   Public arteries--roads, sidewalks--can in most cases be washed
down and returned quickly to use. Here, the most important step is to
ensure that city fire departments and radiological response teams are
well-equipped and trained to move efficiently to get the
decontamination job done. And hospitals and clinics will have to be
prepared to check and reassure the many people who will inevitably
flood in, worried that they have been contaminated. Preventing public
panic and getting the city back to a normal routine would be our
preeminent goals.</TE>
<TE>   The surest way to prevent panic is to educate, and this process
can begin in the schools. Luckily, we no longer have to put
third-graders in fetal positions under their desks. However, we
should tell them what to expect in a radiological attack and make
sure they take packets of information home.</TE>
<TE>   In the workplace, we should take lessons from those who survived
best the horrors of Sept. 11 and train workers how to get out of
buildings safely, calmly and quickly if an attack occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Our firefighters and radiological response teams need to have the
best equipment and training possible; in particular, they need to be
trained to deal effectively with people who are panicking.</TE>
<TE>   Our hospital and public health staffs also need to be trained and
have the diagnostic tools at hand to quickly determine if
contamination has occurred. All of these steps are doable. In many
urban areas, the fire and response teams have gone a considerable
distance to acquire the capabilities needed. Across the board, public
education is the greatest gap that needs attention. The best news is
that we do not have to give up on these homeland defense tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the age of nuclear holocaust, we can confront this threat
and defeat it.</TE>

<HD>Money Could Be the Best Message for Millionaire Simon</HD>
<DH>Candidate could campaign on not having to raise funds like
Davis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL WHALEN</AU>
<BD>Bill Whalen, a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover
Institution, worked on Richard Riordan's gubernatorial exploratory
committee in 2001.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest twist in the governor's race is Republican challenger Bill
Simon Jr.'s opposition to new oil drilling off the California coast,
a stance that puts him at odds with the Bush administration. It made
for big, bold headlines. And, for Simon, it was the first spate of
positive news his campaign has managed to spawn since he captured the
GOP nomination three months ago.</LD>
<LD>   But in the final analysis, it's not Simon's posturing and a couple
of days of good press that matter most. Rather, it's what other
pitches he has in his repertoire besides this one policy curveball,
and how much of his own fortune he is willing to put behind his
attempt to come out a winner.</LD>
<LD>   Simon's newfound wearing of the green (environmental, that is) is
hardly epochal. Think back a dozen years to when then-Sen. Pete
Wilson broke ranks with another President Bush over the same topic,
thus guaranteeing Wilson the crucial votes of environmentalists in
the governor's race.</LD>
<TE>   Any politico will tell you that Californians will cheer oil rigs
off their coast the same day they welcome corporate sponsorship of
Yosemite's Half Dome. So this pronouncement isn't likely to cost
Simon any votes.</TE>
<TE>   What Simon has created is an opportunity to forge his way into the
voting mainstream and, in doing so, inoculate his candidacy against
charges of extremism that the Davis attack machine is certain to
launch. If Simon doesn't want to drill off the coast, in what other
ways is he not a Democrat's stereotype of a conservative Republican?</TE>
<TE>   But that requires the Republican candidate to again break with
conservative orthodoxy--only, next time, risking a rift that
resonates stronger than offshore drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Simon could, for example, side with the president on amnesty for
illegal immigrants. He could soften his stance on gun control. He
could even pick a fight with cultural conservatives, as
then-candidate George W. Bush did in October 1999 when he made a
critical allusion to Robert Bork's "Slouching Towards Gomorrah." Such
a ploy risks alienating loyal Republican voters. But given the
California GOP's inability in recent elections to build beyond a
conservative base, maybe it's time for a risk.</TE>
<TE>   Just as it's time for Simon to do one other thing: Raise the
stakes in this race by staking his campaign with some of his own
fortune. After all, what's the sense in taking stands designed to
make the candidate more competitive if the campaign lacks the
resources to compete for precious air time against a better-financed
incumbent?</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true now that the Davis campaign is buying as
much as $12 million in ads.</TE>
<TE>   Again, there's a risk associated with this. For nearly four years,
Gov. Gray Davis has justified his relentless pursuit of campaign
donations by reasoning that a millionaire might try to buy his or her
way into the governor's office. The moment Simon cuts his campaign a
large check, Davis will say, "I told you so."</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, a way for the Republican candidate to avoid
this trap. Why not hold a press conference and announce that Simon
will offer up one of his own (presumably untainted) dollars for every
dollar Davis has received as governor from special interests; Simon's
good money versus Davis' bad? And that Simon will continue the
dollar-for-dollar match until election day.</TE>
<TE>   This would send a positive message to Republican donors who fear
that the current money advantage is Davis' ultimate trump card. As an
added bonus, it could shift the focus from Simon's wealth to one of
Davis' largest vulnerabilities, his dubious ties to fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about a twist--turning the millionaire label into an asset,
not a liability. But that might be Bill Simon's best route to
victory: a surprise for the press around every corner.</TE>

<HD>Last Boost on 'Laura's Law'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A part of the democratic process that tends to make idealists blanch
will unfold this afternoon in Sacramento. Eleven members of the
Senate Health and Human Services Committee will make a key decision
for the whole state: send an important bill to protect the public and
people with severe mental illness to the full Senate, or cave in to
influential lobbyists and hope that constituents don't notice that
the bill has been killed.</LD>
<LD>   To its credit, the committee has set aside two hours to hear from
proponents of AB 1421, a bill by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson
(D-Davis). The bill would let counties start programs wherein a
judge--after consulting with a severely mentally ill patient, his
legal representative, family members and mental health
professionals--could compel the patient to accept outpatient
treatment, including counseling and medication.</LD>
<LD>   Among those testifying will be Nick and Amanda Wilcox. Quakers,
who believe above all in nonviolence and respect toward others, the
Wilcoxes came to see the need for involuntary treatment after their
19-year-old daughter, Laura, was shot to death by a man whose
psychosis had essentially been ignored. After Nick Wilcox's testimony
for the bill last year, legislators renamed it "Laura's law."</LD>
<TE>   Committee members also will hear Duke University psychiatrist
Marvin S. Swartz describe his studies for the National Institute of
Mental Health. Swartz's work shows that the sort of court-ordered
treatment programs Laura's law would permit, far from confining
people to oppressive hospitals, actually cut hospital admissions by
more than half, reduce the number of people living on streets and in
parks and help seriously mentally ill people stay on new medications.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Assembly passed the bill 65 to 1. Rightly worried
that the full Senate, in much broader public view, also will embrace
the bill, civil libertarians have fought fiercely to kill it in the
committee.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, since its introduction more than two years ago, AB 1421
has been amended numerous times to provide comprehensive civil rights
protections.</TE>
<TE>   We hold individual liberties, including those of the mentally ill,
in sacred regard. And we have repeatedly endorsed this long-overdue
legislation. The public's elected representatives in the full Senate
deserve the right to weigh in on Laura's law.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To take action: Call the senators on the committee who will vote
on the bill today: (all in the 916 area code): Jim Battin (R-La
Quinta, 445-5581); Wes Chesboro (D-Arcata, 445-3375); Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier, 327-8315); Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont, 445-6671); Ray
Haynes (R-Riverside, 445-9781); Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica,
445-1353); Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside, 445-3731); Deborah Ortiz
(D-Sacramento, 445-7807); Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles, 445-3456);
Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles, 445-1418); John Vasconcellos (D-Santa
Clara, 445-9740).</TE>

<LD>Escalating violence in Israel forced the Bush administration to focus
more attention on the Middle East several months ago, dispatching
emissaries to the region and welcoming many Arab leaders to
Washington. That has produced a more nuanced understanding of the
current conflict, along with a vigorous debate about the U.S. role
inside the administration.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's meetings Saturday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon could have been
another hopeful development. But Bush kicked U.S. policy backward,
endorsing yet more Israeli military attacks on Palestinian targets
and dismissing Mubarak's suggestion of a timetable for Palestinian
statehood.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is correct that Israel has a right to self-defense. But the
most recent raid on Arafat's Ramallah headquarters and reimposition
of house arrest is a military response to the suicide bombing of a
bus in northern Israel last week that killed 17 bus passengers. A
simultaneous political process is required. Israel needs to protect
its people from terrorists, but at the same time negotiate with
Palestinians on a state in the West Bank and Gaza territories
occupied since the 1967 war.</LD>
<TE>   An Israeli official said Bush and Sharon did not discuss the
borders of a Palestinian state or the fate of Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Those issues are among the most
divisive between Palestinians and Israelis, along with the return of
Palestinian refugees to Israel and the status of Jerusalem. They are
certain to come up at a U.S.-sponsored international peace conference
on the Middle East that Washington says will be held this year,
perhaps in Turkey. Bush hinted that the conference could be delayed
because "no one has confidence in the emerging Palestinian
government." It is true that the conference will be doomed without
detailed preparation and a firm agenda, but Palestinians may see
delays in the talks as a stall.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak, Sharon and Bush do agree on the need for reform of the
Palestinian Authority, known for corruption and feuding among its
security forces. Arafat's supposed government reorganization--a
smaller Cabinet and a new interior minister--was largely cosmetic.</TE>
<TE>   Even with his headquarters in shards, Arafat is not powerless. He
must take far tougher action to stop suicide bombings, or most
Israelis, not just Sharon and his supporters, will continue to doubt
he is willing to live in peace with Israel. But Israel's prime
minister cannot decide who heads the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes were high two years ago at Camp David that a lasting peace
was near. The U.S. is still the key to getting Israelis and
Palestinians to holster their guns. Bush should get back on track to
a plan that promises security for both sides.</TE>

<LD>Here's a history lesson for Interior Secretary Gale Norton. She needs
it.</LD>
<LD>   On Jan. 28, 1969, an oil rig blew out more than three miles
offshore from Santa Barbara. The images of dying birds, sick seals
and goo-coated beaches that followed went around the world. It was
the worst such accident up to that time and a major impetus for the
environmental movement. It helped lead to the first Earth Day in
April 1970. And since then, Californians have stood as one against
offshore drilling.</LD>
<LD>   Not a single new drilling lease has been granted in state waters.
A federal moratorium on leasing was imposed in 1981 and was renewed
in 1991 during the presidency of George W. Bush's father. The federal
ban was extended by Bill Clinton through 2012.</LD>
<TE>   Only ignorance of that history could have led Norton to state a
few days ago, "A major difference between Florida and California is
that Florida opposes coastal drilling and California does not."</TE>
<TE>   Norton wrote that in a caustic letter to Gov. Gray Davis,
explaining why the Bush administration was buying out undeveloped oil
leases off the coast of Florida (a result desired by Bush's brother,
Gov. Jeb Bush) but not similar leases off Central California.</TE>
<TE>   Californians are more united regarding offshore oil drilling than
on any other environmental issue. Republican Pete Wilson, Davis'
predecessor, was a leading opponent of further leasing both as a U.S.
senator and as governor. Davis also has been steadfast.</TE>
<TE>   Norton does have one loophole in her statement. Notice she talked
of Florida and California, not Floridians and Californians. This is
because California has allowed oil companies to drill from existing
rigs while Florida still has no rigs at all. Lucky Florida. The oil
companies came to California first. Contractually, California can't
stop production without buying out the oil companies. Would the Bush
administration care to put up billions for that?</TE>
<TE>   There's no denying that Florida has a beautiful coast and
fantastic beaches. But California's 1,100-mile shoreline, from the
Norway-like North Coast to the sweeping sand and surf of the south,
is incomparable.</TE>
<TE>   Norton says the administration will honor the state's existing
lease moratorium. Fine. And if the test is how jealously a state
guards its coast, then surely California has earned the same courtesy
granted to Florida. Cancel those Central Coast leases, too.</TE>

<HD>Norton on Oil Leases: State Knows the Drill</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "U.S. Refuses to Buy Back Oil Leases," June 8: Clearly, those who
claim the Bush administration has declared war on California are
correct, as evidenced once more in the statement by Interior
Secretary Gale A. Norton of the administration's intent to allow the
resumption of offshore drilling here. I find myself in complete awe
of the sheer avarice that President Bush and Co. exhibit.</LD>
<LD>   Norton's comment about Californians not opposing offshore drilling
is so blatantly false that one can't help but think she can't be that
uninformed, so this must be a form of propaganda that the
administration is somehow going to try to make us believe.</LD>
<LD>   What Norton may fail to realize about the people of California: We
will not allow drilling off our coast. We will stop it by any means
necessary, as we have proven before. My recommendation to Norton:
Don't even try it, you'll end up with your career destroyed.</LD>
<TE>   Bruce Albertine</TE>
<TE>   Port Hueneme</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So the Bush administration is refusing to save California's
coastline as it saved Florida's wetlands from further oil exploration
and drilling, because "Florida opposes coastal drilling, and
California does not." Let's be honest: What Florida has that
California does not is Bush's brother, Jeb, running for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Felice Sussman</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Norton's quote would be better worded: "A major difference
between Florida and California is that Florida's governor is the
brother of our president and California's is not."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a longtime, former resident of New Jersey, I was disappointed at
the perpetuation of ridiculous stereotypes put into print in the June
11 editorial "Never Mind the Buzzer." It is to be expected that
television coverage of the Nets-Lakers playoff games is ignorant of
the fact that New Jersey is not New York, as they hold up headlines
of the New York Post and Newsday instead of the Newark Star-Ledger
and interview New Yorkers on the street instead of New Jerseyites.
But not your editorial staff.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey residents do not bemoan the fact that they are not New
Yorkers, nor are they ashamed of their beautiful state. New Jersey is
the home of Bell Laboratories, Princeton University, the best
tomatoes grown in the U.S.--not to mention the birthplace of
Shaquille O'Neal. Its residents have much to be proud of, and they
are. Please desist in putting down other states. It makes
Californians look a bit insecure.</LD>

<LD>Amitai Etzioni glosses over the serious and widespread errors
inherent in all Internet blocking programs ("Internet Can Be a Safe
Place for Kids and for Free Speech," Commentary, June 6). Contrary to
his assertions, the blocking programs are far from "99% accurate,"
they are not "getting better," and they continue to prevent access to
thousands of pages of non-pornographic content.</LD>
<LD>   My testimony at the recent Children's Internet Protection Act
trial in Philadelphia bears this out. I documented thousands of
examples of over-blocking--sites that shouldn't have been blocked
according to the software companies' own definitions but that
nonetheless were blocked on multiple occasions in months of repeated
testing. Wrongly blocked pages went far beyond the health and
sexuality sites Etzioni admits are often erroneously restricted; I
also found thousands of examples of blocking of the Web sites of
political candidates, rock bands, small businesses like flower stores
and home improvement shops, and even a text-only site discussing the
perils of child pornography.</LD>
<LD>   The problems with blocking software are fundamental, I concluded
in my expert report, and the Philadelphia federal court agreed.</LD>

<HD>Wanted: Agents Fluent in Intelligence Gathering</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days it seems like every issue of The Times has to include at
least one gratuitous slap against that most despised foe of the
politically correct, the straight white male. The June 9 Opinion
section continued this tradition. Criticizing the FBI's new, loosened
information-gathering rules, Christopher Pyle stated that having
"English-only white guys" gathering intelligence on Muslims in the
U.S. won't do any good. Were "English-only white guys" among the
Minneapolis agents who raised the red flags about Zacarias Moussaoui?
The agents' race and gender did not impede their ability to detect a
possible Muslim terrorist plot. In fact, if those agents had been
given the ability to employ more aggressive intelligence-gathering
methods, there's a very real chance that the 9/11 plot may have been
detected.</LD>
<LD>   I have no idea why Pyle chose to bring race and gender into his
discussion. Does he think that "English-only white women" would do a
better job? What about Latino agents? Would they fare any better than
white agents? Would Pyle argue that African American agents cannot be
effective in analyzing information gathered in investigations of
white supremacists and white right-wing militias?</LD>
<LD>   The increasingly frequent swipes against white males in The Times
should make even the most non-conspiratorial reader question whether
there is some kind of quota for these diatribes.</LD>

<LD>"Nailing Our Demands to the Door of the Catholic Church" (Commentary,
June 10), Marcos McPeek Villatoro's column about the "demands" he
makes of the Catholic bishops at their meeting in Dallas this week is
typical of someone whose agenda is not to just stop the sexual abuse
but to get the church to change some of its most fundamental
teachings that have nothing to do with the current scandal. He wants
women priests, women bishops and an end to celibacy. There are plenty
of churches that already have exactly that--they are called
Protestant, and I'm sure they'd be happy to take in Villatoro.</LD>
<LD>   The Catholic Church needs serious reforms to make sure it
addresses the victims of the sexual abuse scandal and takes measures
to make sure this never happens again. What it doesn't need is the
theological dissidence that led to this problem in the first place.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Confession's Good for the Soul, and Better if It Carries Right
Spin," June 7: Steve Lopez has ridiculed one of the most sacred rites
of my Catholic religion, the sacrament of reconciliation. I am
offended, as I am sure thousands of Catholics whom he reaches are.
There are those of us whose faith has become even stronger, even
though a small number of our priests have done great wrong. There is
nothing wrong with the Catholic Church. There is something wrong with
many of the people in the church.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's profession is not altruistic. Compensation is determined
by the reporter's readership. In driving the news on this story,
Lopez hopes to become more popular while he does irreparable harm to
those Catholics (as I'm sure he was at one time) who don't understand
the teachings of our faith. He needs our prayers as much as our
erring priests do.</TE>

<TE>   Kudos for Lopez. Teachers can lose their credentials just for not
reporting child abuse. Cardinals and bishops seem to think they are
above the law. It's time all the "Cardinal Roger Mahonys" were made
responsible for their sins too.</TE>

<LD>Re "In Growing Numbers, Palestinian Boys Are Choosing the Brief Life
of a 'Martyr,' " June 10: Maybe somebody should let your reporter
know that in a democratic society boys could not "choose" suicide.
These boys are the ultimate victims of child abuse.</LD>
<LD>   To blame the desire to become a suicide bomber on "the grinding
frustration over torturous roadblocks and checkpoints erected by
Israeli forces" is laughable. Since America was attacked our people
have been subjected to sometimes humiliating searches before boarding
planes; I don't see this motivating anyone here to become a suicide
bomber.</LD>

<TE>   The Bush administration was not speaking of the creation of a
Palestinian state a year ago. The main difference between now and
then is that, in the meantime, Islamic terrorists have murdered
thousands of Americans and hundreds of Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Now the president is planning to reward these killers with a state
of their own. If we want to survive as a free nation, we should be
ending states that sponsor terrorism, not creating more of them.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Bush Refuses to Set Mideast Timetable," June 9: The main
concern of President Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is to find
a way to stop violence in order to be able to resume the peace
process. However, too much emphasis is put on the violence from the
Palestinians' side. It looks like the Palestinians are the ones who
are able to control everything. Other times it seems that a
Palestinian life is not as valuable as an Israeli life, if we take a
look at the death tolls.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Israelis stop the use of violence and the Palestinians
continue to use it, it is because there exists another kind of
violence: occupation. We need to put an end to this as well,
otherwise we'd be deluding ourselves. If occupation is the problem,
solving the problem by more occupation accompanied by terror will
certainly be ineffective. No excuses should be made for forbidding a
people their undeniable right of freedom. It is indeed a right that
has been ignored for 35 years.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a reward that the Israelis will offer the Palestinians
after certain conditions are met. Only after occupation stops will
violence stop, and not the other way around. Let's be realistic for a
moment and find effective and fair solutions to bring safety to both
the Israelis and the Palestinians.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Police investigate a possible link to ongoing feud
between Hells Angels and Mongols.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 25-year-old Hells Angels member from Ventura County was fatally
shot in Arizona, and authorities are investigating whether the
homicide was linked to an ongoing power struggle between two biker
gangs.</LD>
<LD>   Joshua William Harber, a lifelong county resident who worked as a
mason and lived in Oak View, was shot once in the cheek about 12:15
a.m. Saturday outside the Coyote Wild Bar &amp; Grill in Cave Creek,
police said. He died later that day at John C. Lincoln Hospital in
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Harber became a member of the biker gang about six months ago,
said George Christie Jr., 54, a co-founder of the Hells Angels'
Ventura chapter and a longtime national club spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   "Josh was not an imposing person," Christie said Tuesday. "I don't
know why someone would want to shoot him."</TE>
<TE>   Organized-crime detectives with the Phoenix Police Department were
investigating several motives, including the possibility that the
slaying was in retaliation for another recent killing in the gaming
town of Laughlin, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at that ... it could be fallout," Sgt. Lauri
Williams said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   On April 27, during the 20th annual Laughlin River Run, a
fistfight broke out between members of the Hells Angels and the rival
Mongols, a Los Angeles-based gang that has long sought a toehold in
Arizona. In a shootout at Harrah's Casino &amp; Hotel in Laughlin, three
bikers were killed and at least 12 were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Christie declined to comment on the feud. However, he acknowledged
that Phoenix detectives were planning to come to Ventura this week to
interview members of the motorcycle club.</TE>
<TE>   According to Christie, Harber rode his motorcycle to Arizona with
five fellow club members from Ventura. There was no planned event and
police believe the group showed up primarily to drink and party.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Harber walked outside the Cave Creek bar and was
approached by an unidentified man. The two had a brief conversation
before the man shot Harber in the face and fled.</TE>
<TE>   Police would not say whether any physical evidence was found at
the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Several witnesses at the bar, a known Hells Angels hangout,
described the shooter as a white male, about 6 feet 1 and 240 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Williams said officers had dealt with relatively few problems
with Hells Angels members at the Cave Creek bar. However, she added
that cases involving rivalries were difficult because the Mongols had
not been wearing their gang colors locally.</TE>

<HD>Public Help Sought in Identifying Baby Found Dead at Waste
Plant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When police find an infant abandoned in a trash can or dumpster, they
canvass the neighborhood for witnesses or evidence.</LD>
<LD>   But when the baby is found at a busy waste processing plant, where
trucks dump scores of loads every hour, an already difficult task
becomes nearly impossible.</LD>
<LD>   "It compounds the problem immensely," said Det. Sgt. Richard
Longshore of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   Longshore said the public's help, and luck, will be needed to find
the person who dumped a day-old girl in the trash Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The body was found Monday evening by workers separating recyclable
materials from trash on a conveyor belt at Athens Disposal Co. in the
City of Industry.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy determined that the girl, who was born alive, died of
blunt-force trauma. Investigators said uncertainty about the body's
origin will complicate the task of finding who dumped her.</TE>
<TE>   Athens Disposal has hundreds of routes from West Covina to
Pasadena, Longshore said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a daunting task, and we're going to need the public's help,"
Longshore said. "But someone was pregnant to a full term and has no
child to produce."</TE>
<TE>   The infant appeared to be "a female Hispanic, full term, with dark
hair," Longshore said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are analyzing debris found near the body in a search
for clues, and the search for a suspect is focused in the eastern
part of the San Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a needle in a haystack," said sheriff's Det. Sgt. Dan Scott,
who has investigated child abuse cases for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Scott said studies have shown that it's misleading to assume that
the typical suspect in such a case is a young woman who is pregnant
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no stereotypical suspect," Scott said, adding that women
in their mid-30s with several children have abandoned infants.</TE>
<TE>   The only consistent pattern, Scott said, is secrecy about the
pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a state law that allows anyone to drop an infant off at a
hospital emergency room for up to 72 hours after birth--no questions
asked--Scott said he was aware of very few cases in which people have
done so.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get the word out that this didn't have to happen,"
Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   People with information about the case are asked to call the
Sheriff's Department at (323) 890-5500.</TE>

<HD>Earth First! Pair Win Jury Award</HD>
<DH>Courts: Panel finds FBI, Oakland police violated their
rights in 1990 car-bombing case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL and KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Ending a two-month trial and handing Earth First! activist
Judi Bari a posthumous vindication, a federal jury awarded $2.9
million to her estate Tuesday after finding FBI agents and Oakland
police officers violated her civil rights in their handling of a
car-bombing investigation 12 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Bari, who died of breast cancer in 1997, and fellow activist
Darryl Cherney were arrested for transporting explosives after a pipe
bomb blew up in Bari's car in May 1990, severely injuring her.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors later declined to press charges and the two sued,
complaining that the government had framed them and engaged in a
smear campaign to discredit their movement against redwood logging on
the North Coast.</LD>
<TE>   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated for more than three weeks
before reading its verdict around noon Tuesday from a complicated,
21-page form. The jurors awarded Cherney $1.5 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   Bari's attorneys and supporters hugged and cried after the jury
was excused. A few dozen environmental activists waved placards and
cheered as the panel left the federal building in downtown Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was seen by many on the political left as a test of
broader allegations that the government unfairly disrupted the
activities of radical groups beginning in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken rejected the plaintiffs' effort
to make the trial a platform for such issues, including
counterintelligence against the Black Panthers. But the victors still
found in the verdict a broad condemnation of the FBI and other
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI lied over and over again about me and Judi Bari and they
used the Oakland [Police Department] as their lackeys," said Cherney,
who performed one of his activist songs on the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   "Suing the FBI is something more Americans need to be involved
with."</TE>
<TE>   On the courthouse steps, Darlene Comingore, executor of Bari's
estate, said the verdict was "really beyond our wildest dreams. This
jury got it .... We hope the FBI in Oakland and all the police
departments out there that think they can violate people's rights now
know that they can't get away with it."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys declined comment as they left court. A Justice
Department spokesman in Washington said his agency was reviewing the
verdict and "would decide in the near future what our next step will
be."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the afternoon, Oakland Deputy City Atty. Bill Simmons
called the verdict disappointing and said the city will consider an
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "As to much of the verdict, especially the 1st Amendment findings,
we are just not able to understand what evidence they've relied on to
come to those findings," Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Wilken dropped two FBI defendants from the complaint
for lack of evidence at the end of testimony. The jury cleared a third
FBI defendant of any violation.</TE>
<TE>   But six other defendants, three with the FBI and three with the
Oakland police, were found to have violated Bari's or Cherney's civil
rights to varying degrees.</TE>
<TE>   In deciding liability, the jury placed the heaviest blame on Clyde
M. Sims, an Oakland police lieutenant who headed his department's
investigation of the car bombing, FBI Agent John Reikes, who headed
the terrorism squad in San Francisco, and Frank Doyle, an FBI bomb
specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Other defendants implicated in some way were the FBI's Philip Sena
and Oakland Police Officers Robert Chenault and Michael Sitterud.</TE>
<TE>   The jury concluded that Bari's 4th Amendment rights against
unlawful search and seizure had been violated, as well as her 1st
Amendment right of freedom of expression.</TE>
<TE>   The jury was hung on whether Cherney's 4th Amendment rights had
been violated in connection with his arrest, but agreed they had been
violated by a search warrant for his home. The panel also agreed that
his 1st Amendment rights had been violated.</TE>
<TE>   The jury rejected claims that the defendants had engaged in a
conspiracy to deprive Bari and Cherney of their rights.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Cunningham, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, speculated that
the conspiracy charge may have seemed superfluous to the jury. "It
really doesn't detract from [the verdict] much," he said. "The fact
is that substantial violations were established."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham, one of a team of attorneys who had worked on the case
for years, said it is unusual for a civil rights lawsuit involving
political activists to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a lot of such cases and most of them have not been that
successful," he said. But the behavior of authorities in the Bari
case "was really calculated," Cunningham said. "They had to really go
out of their way to do this ... and I think the jury comprehended
that in a full way."</TE>
<TE>   Judge Wilken instructed the jury of eight women and two men not to
talk to the media after the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the bombing, Bari and Cherney were organizing
"Redwood Summer," a series of protests against the logging of
old-growth redwoods. The case has never been solved.</TE>
<TE>   During six weeks of testimony, the plaintiffs painted law
enforcement as so eager to incriminate Bari and Cherney that they
ignored death threats the pair had received and never bothered to
conduct a thorough investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing put Bari in the hospital for two months and left her
with permanent injuries. Cherney, a front-seat passenger in the car,
suffered minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The two key claims upon which investigators based the arrests were
later contradicted or could not be proven: that nails wrapped around
the crudely made pipe bomb matched those found in Bari's home and
that the device went off when it was sitting in open view on the
car's rear floorboard.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI crime lab subsequently concluded that the bomb had
exploded under Bari's seat. And prosecutors found the nails had been
manufactured in such large batches that a close match was impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Though charges were never filed against Bari and Cherney, they
complained the arrests and ensuing publicity forever damned them in
the public eye as violent terrorists who had blown themselves up.</TE>
<TE>   Bari gave a videotaped deposition shortly before her death. Parts
of it were presented during the trial on large-screen monitors in the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Cherney, shorn of the bushy North Woods beard he had at the time
of the bombing, took the stand, at one point performing "Spike a Tree
for Jesus" for the jury.</TE>
<TE>   During closing statements, Cherney's attorneys apologized for the
song, conceding that it might have been a bit much for a federal
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony, FBI and Oakland Police Department defendants both
pointed to the other agency as the one that rushed to judgment in the
arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys also said their clients had handled the
investigation properly, and had ample reason to arrest Bari and
Cherney.</TE>
<TE>   They cited provocative statements by Cherney as evidence that he
was not the peaceful environmental organizer he presented himself to
be.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1990 network television interview, Cherney had said that if
he were terminally ill, he would strap explosives to himself and blow
up a dam or corporate headquarters after hours.</TE>
<TE>   Heroes to many in the environmental movement, Bari and Cherney
were viewed widely as dangerous radicals by management and workers in
the California timber industry.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Bullwinkel, spokeswoman for Humboldt County-based Pacific
Lumber Co., a longtime target of the Earth First! organization, said
the company had no comment on the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   But environmental groups in Northern California were encouraged by
the jury's decision and substantial award.</TE>
<TE>   "Environmental groups will be hardened and empowered by this
decision," said Dana Stolzman, a member of the Environmental
Protection Information Center, a Mendocino County-based advocacy
group for the protection of old-growth forests.</TE>
<TE>   Stolzman said the 1990 arrests of Bari and Cherney had a temporary
chilling effect on the environmental movement.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict, Stolzman said, "affirms that the 1st Amendment rights
should be upheld. People should be able to advocate the protection of
ancient redwoods without risking their lives."</TE>

<HD>Affidavits Say Blake Offered 'Hit' to 5</HD>
<DH>Crime: Bonny Bakley's brother told police that the actor
asked him to 'eliminate' someone, documents show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Robert Blake asked as many as five people to kill his wife for
him before he allegedly shot her to death last year in Studio City,
according to Los Angeles police affidavits unsealed Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Besides the two former stuntmen Blake is charged with soliciting
to kill Bonny Lee Bakley, he asked three others, including Bakley's
brother, Joe, to kill for him, according to the documents.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Bakley told police that Blake, who maintains his innocence,
offered him $5,000 to "eliminate" someone at some time before
Bakley's death, but never specified who the victim might be,
according to the affidavits.</LD>
<TE>   A private investigator, William Welch, told police last summer
that Blake had told him two years earlier that he wanted to hire a
doctor to abort the baby Bakley was carrying shortly after it was
conceived and that the actor said, "if that doesn't work we are going
to whack her," the affidavits said.</TE>
<TE>   The lead investigator, LAPD Det. Ronald Y. Ito, contends in the
documents that the 68-year-old Blake's co-defendant, Earle Caldwell,
46, was set to kill Bakley a week before her death but "lost his
nerve."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and police believe that on May 4, 2001, Blake pulled
the trigger of a 9-millimeter pistol and fatally shot Bakley, 44,
whom he had married six months earlier after a paternity test showed
he fathered her child. Bakley was found mortally wounded in Blake's
car near Vitello's restaurant in Studio City, where the couple had
dined earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun, has said that many men,
including Blake, had a motive for killing Bakley, a grifter who
promised lonely men sex and nude photos in exchange for money.</TE>
<TE>   But Braun said Tuesday the allegations against Blake are bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   "They're making it seem like he stood on a street corner and tried
to get someone to kill his wife," Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   Welch said Tuesday that his statements were accurate, but he
declined to elaborate. Caldwell, Joe Bakley and the two former
stuntmen could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Statements made to police by various people who knew Blake are
summarized in the affidavit supporting the Los Angeles Police
Department's April 18 request for a warrant to arrest Blake and
Caldwell. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler
unsealed that warrant and 12 search warrants Tuesday at the request
of The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Blake and Caldwell are charged with conspiring to kill Bakley.
Blake also is charged with her murder with the special circumstance
of lying in wait and soliciting two others to kill her. Each
defendant faces life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Blake and Caldwell pleaded not guilty in April. Blake is being
held without bail at Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles.
Caldwell was released after Blake posted his $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   In the documents released Tuesday, authorities say former stuntman
Roy "Snuffy" Harrison, 66, of West Hills arranged separate meetings
between Blake and the two other stuntmen who worked with Blake on the
1970s television series "Baretta" at Du-Par's restaurant in Studio
City in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Gary "Whiz Kid" McLarty, 61, of Lake View Terrace told police that
Blake offered to pay him $10,000 to kill Bakley. McLarty said he
refused to do it, according to an affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, 65, of Lucerne Valley also told police
that Blake asked him to kill Bakley, according to an affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time that Blake was meeting with McLarty and
Hambleton, the actor also was trying to contact another former
stuntman, Bobby Bass, who instructed O.J. Simpson on using a knife
for his role in the television pilot "Frogmen." Bass, who had
Parkinson's disease, told police that he declined to meet with Blake,
the affidavit said. Bass committed suicide in November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Welch, a retired Los Angeles Police Department detective, told
investigators that Blake rejected his idea in October 1999 to pay
Bakley $100,000 to leave Los Angeles and let Blake take custody of
their child. Then, Blake suggested they force her to get an abortion
or kill her, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   Welch told police that Blake did not offer to pay him a specific
amount, but said that "money was no object," according to the
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Police said in the affidavit that two of Bakley's friends told
investigators about a camping trip that had scared Bakley a week
before her death.</TE>
<TE>   According to what Bakley's friends told police, Bakley told them
Caldwell was carrying a gun in front of her and Blake and saying, "I
can't do it." Then, Blake put his hand on Caldwell's shoulder and
said, "It's OK. I'll take care of it," singer Robert Stefanow told
police.</TE>
<TE>   The documents indicate that when investigators searched Caldwell's
property in June 2001, LAPD Det. Brian Tyndall found a World War
II-era Mauser pistol in Caldwell's car.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley was killed with another World War II-vintage German pistol,
an unregistered Walther P-38, found in a dumpster about 10 feet from
where Blake's car was parked the night of the Bakley shooting. It had
no fingerprints and was covered in fresh motor oil, the affidavits
said. The one bullet left in the gun matched two casings found in and
near the car, the affidavits said.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell's former girlfriend, Lisa Johnson, told police in April
that she believed she had seen a Walther pistol at Caldwell's
apartment before the slaying, the affidavits said.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell was in San Mateo the night Bakley was shot twice while
sitting in the passenger seat of Blake's car.</TE>
<TE>   Blake told authorities that he had walked back to Vitello's to
retrieve a .38-caliber handgun he had forgotten there, and returned
to find Bakley shot and bleeding in his car.</TE>

<HD>Plans for Boroughs Discussed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) and City
Councilwoman Wendy Greuel said they made progress Tuesday in talks to
combine their separate borough plans for Los Angeles, but the future
role of the council remains an obstacle.</LD>
<LD>   Hertzberg's plan would replace the 15-member City Council with
nine borough presidents appointed by elected boards. Greuel has
proposed retaining the council to deal with citywide issues.</LD>
<LD>   The current council and Mayor James K. Hahn would have to approve
a borough plan for the Nov. 5 ballot, where it would be an
alternative to secession by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. It
is considered unlikely that the council would put before voters any
proposal that could cost panel members their jobs.</LD>
<TE>   "There are a lot of issues to be resolved," Hertzberg said after
his 70-minute meeting with Greuel in her City Hall office. It was
their first face-to-face discussion on the borough proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she hopes the two plans can be blended before the July
17 deadline for getting a measure on the fall ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very productive meeting," she said. "We agree on the
goals and principles of a borough system."</TE>
<TE>   The councilwoman's proposal is far less dramatic than Hertzberg's.
It calls for creation of a 15-member commission that would have a
year to draft a borough plan, which would include local elected
boards and the City Council. Voters would have to OK the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Under Hertzberg's proposal, each borough would have a five-member
elected council, which would appoint a borough president. The
councils would make local budget and planning decisions while the
nine presidents would together handle citywide matters.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg said the Voting Rights Act might bar an unelected board
of borough presidents.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing more research," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither proposal has generated much enthusiasm at City Hall.
Council President Alex Padilla said he is worried about rushing a
complicated plan onto the same ballot as the secession measures
without more scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Something so fundamental to the structure of city government
should be in the spotlight, not in the shadow," Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   A council committee has been holding public meetings on the Greuel
proposal. A session in Hollywood on Monday night found support for
boroughs in general. Even Ferris Wehbe, co-founder of Hollywood VOTE,
the group pushing for Hollywood secession, spoke in favor of the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Put something good and sincere on the ballot and you will be
amazed; it will win," he said. However, Wehbe said later that a vote
on boroughs should come after the secession election, maybe in March.</TE>

<LD>The boyfriend of a 13-year-old girl who was found shot to death early
Sunday in an apartment the two shared in Lancaster is being sought
for her slaying, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Santino "Sonny" Casio, a 20-year-old parolee, allegedly shot
Evelyn Brenda Cendejas in the head following an argument late
Saturday night, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Rick Myers.</LD>
<LD>   Police believe Cendejas ran away from home in Palmdale and moved
into a duplex apartment in the 1100 block of West Avenue H-14 with
Casio in April.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't know where she was staying," said Cendejas' cousin,
Robert Mendez, 19. "She would call just to let us know that she was
all right."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the family heard from Cendejas was Mother's Day,
Mendez said.</TE>
<TE>   Casio was described as 5 foot 9, weighing 190 pounds, with a
shaved head and brown eyes. He has a tattoo of a paw print on the
back of his head and tattoo horns at his front hairline, said Lt. Dan
Rosenberg of the sheriff's homicide bureau. He is currently on parole
from the California Youth Authority for burglary, Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "How can this happen to a 13-year-old girl?" said Cendejas'
26-year-old brother, who declined to give his first name. "She's my
baby sister. We're trying to do everything we can to make sure that
this person is caught and justice is served."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to contact the county sheriff's
homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500.</TE>

<LD>A former investigator for Los Angeles County's child welfare
department, demoted after launching a 1998 investigation that touched
the agency's former boss, won a $450,000 settlement from the county
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   When Rebecca Lizarraga refused to back down in her 10-month
investigation of Sandra Rodriguez, a foster mother closely allied
with a former director of the Department of Children and Family
Services, her superiors launched a harassment campaign that ended
with her demotion to social worker, she alleged in two lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   "I put my job on the line. I was told I would be protected ... and
I wasn't," Lizarraga told county supervisors after they approved the
settlement.</LD>

that the car would be impounded.</LD>
<LD>   The two men became "entangled" somehow as the driver accelerated
over a curb and toward a house, said LAPD Sgt. John Pasquariello. The
officer, in fear for his life, fired twice, Pasquariello said.</LD>

<HD>Play's the Thing That Links Kids in L.A., London</HD>
<DH>Exchange: Pupils in the two cities use Internet to jointly
study theater and learn about one another.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KERRY MADDEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before their Internet and theater exchange program began, the fourth-
and fifth-graders in Los Angeles and London had some wry
misconceptions about each other.</LD>
<LD>   To name two: For recess in L.A., all children go to the beach to
play volleyball. Some aristocratic kids in London still carry swords
and write with those big feather pens.</LD>
<LD>   Then along came WebPlay, a semester-long program in which children
at 18 Los Angeles schools and the same number in London correspond
online to learn about the others' culture and daily lives. They use
that information to help write short plays set in the other city,
with advice on the Internet and in person from British theater
professionals.</LD>
<TE>   "Theater and the Internet are two of our strongest forms of
communication; one is an ancient art and the other, brand new. We
felt that together they could be a very powerful experience," said
WebPlay's creator, Sydney Thornbury, a Los Angeles native and public
school graduate who studied drama in London and worked in education
there.</TE>
<TE>   At El Sereno Elementary, one of the participating Los Angeles
schools, fourth-grade teacher Joanne Medeiros said the exchanges open
youngsters' eyes to a wider world, as well as to history, geography,
computer literacy and playwriting skills.</TE>
<TE>   "The students learn very fast that they have a lot more in common
than they have differences," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Mazouzi, Medeiros' partner teacher at English Martyrs
School in London, agrees: "The kids just loved it. All of a sudden,
the Los Angeles children became very real to them. It was almost as
if they were here with us."</TE>
<TE>   During the computer exchanges, the students in each Los Angeles
school are matched up with groups in London to question one another
about hobbies, music, food and families. They can also refer to the
WebPlay site to study photos, with sound effects, of scenes in both
cities, such as L.A.'s In-N-Out Burger or the Tower Bridge on the
Thames. Once written, their three-minute plays are rehearsed,
videotaped and posted on the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "With WebPlay, we can really talk to classes that are not in our
states and make new friends by knowing how they feel," said El Sereno
fourth-grader Seneisa Estrada. Her wish? To fly to London to meet
those students face to face.</TE>
<TE>   Her classmate, Arturo Guzman Jr., said: "The kids in London all
have accents, but the funny thing is, they think we have accents."</TE>
<TE>   The American and British students e-mail professional artists in
London at the Polka Theatre with queries. Each week, someone from the
Polka Theatre is featured on the Web site, and youngsters can tour
the life of a costumer, designer, playwright, director or actor.</TE>
<TE>   Polka Theatre actors performed an original play, "Star Gazer" by
children's theater playwright Richard Shannon, in London and Los
Angeles and conducted daylong workshops at each school in
improvisation and playwriting. The troupe was in Los Angeles for
three weeks earlier this spring.</TE>
<TE>   In both cities, groups of four or five students collaborated to
create their own plays, with enough parts for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Students at English Martyrs set their plays at Venice Beach, a
film studio in Hollywood, a drive-through hamburger joint and a
shopping mall. El Sereno's writers used the Old Globe Theatre, Big
Ben and Buckingham Palace as settings.</TE>
<TE>   One El Sereno group wrote "Meeting Britney Spears," in which a
giddy Prince William introduces his rock singer fiancee to Queen
Elizabeth. Clearly unimpressed, the queen takes one look at the
dancing American and shouts, "Guards, take her away!" Britney's
response? "Hey, you're a wicked person, you know!"</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning in the El Sereno computer lab, Medeiros'
students greeted WebPlay founder Thornbury by all donning black
berets, her signature fashion item. She is a hands-on supervisor,
coaching teachers, chauffeuring actors and even showing students how
to impersonate Spears.</TE>
<TE>   Thornbury and Medeiros make sure the dialogue is authentic.
Special lists of British and American English words are posted,
including "Diapers=Nappies, Potato Chips=crisps, French Fries=chips."
One El Sereno play, "The Day the Building Was in Danger" was about
how the Old Globe Theatre faced closure unless the Shakespearean
troupe raised 3,000 British pounds. Thornbury, who also videotaped
the plays, had to re-shoot a scene several times because one actor
kept saying, "We need 3,000 dollars!" instead of "pounds."</TE>
<TE>   The budget for WebPlay is about $157,000. The majority of funding
comes from British education authorities and two private British
foundations, the Esmee Fairbairn Charitable Trust and the Southwark
Education Business Alliance. Each participating Los Angeles school
pays $1,000 from its arts budget, and the school district's arts and
education branch provides matching grants.</TE>
<TE>   Thornbury said her goal was to connect arts and technology for
budding playwrights and actors. Through Oracle's Think.com, a closed
site for teachers and students, WebPlay crisscrosses socioeconomic
and national boundaries, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Thornbury studied at
the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and stayed in London eight more
years working with schools through arts, technology and business. She
then focused on bringing WebPlay to Los Angeles, where it began last
year in five schools.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Alonzo, superintendent of Subdistrict F of the Los Angeles
Unified School District, helped Thornbury mount El Sereno's computer
lab when the program was launched. "Through a great literacy program
like WebPlay, the students are able to make a person-to-person
connection, write about it and then act it out. Shy kids can become
stars as they meet new worlds," Alonzo said.</TE>
<TE>   During the Polka Theatre's visit to Los Angeles, the troupe
performed for all the WebPlay students at the Los Angeles Theatre
Center and was honored at a reception humorously referred to behind
the scenes as "Bangers and Mash Meets Chips and Salsa."</TE>
<TE>   In a play teeming with special effects, rich characters and humor,
the actors conveyed that theater has boundless possibilities. The
associate director of Polka Theatre, Roman Stefanski, recalls: "It
was such a joy to reach out across the pond and see the people with
whom I've been communicating on the computer, not to mention the SUN,
SUN, SUN of L.A.!"</TE>

<HD>Some Have Second Thoughts on Secession</HD>
<DH>Valley: A few leaders who had leaned toward a civic divorce
but are troubled by the details no longer back breakup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small but influential group of San Fernando Valley residents have
distanced themselves from the secession group Valley VOTE, some
criticizing the secession proposal making its way toward the November
ballot and others simply unsure about whether to move forward now
that breaking up Los Angeles is a real possibility.</LD>
<LD>   At play are factors ranging from practical concerns about the
impact of secession on water rates to long-standing political
rivalries and disagreements.</LD>
<LD>   Also in the mix is the lure of two proposals to restructure Los
Angeles into boroughs, an alternative to secession that supporters
hope will win the backing of people who are unhappy with city
services but wary of taking the more dramatic move of breaking up the
city.</LD>
<TE>   "I have to be convinced that my neighbors and I would be a lot
better off if the Valley secedes," said Barbara Romey, a community
activist and longtime secession supporter. "Why would you go from the
frying pan into the fire?"</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the heads of two powerful Valley homeowner associations
criticized Valley VOTE, which was formed to study secession but has
evolved into a powerful advocate of breaking up the city.</TE>
<TE>   Don Shultz of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. resigned from the
organization's board, angry that its leadership had made a political
compromise that would parcel Van Nuys into six council districts in
the new city.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz said he will appear at a news conference today with Mayor
James K. Hahn to formally announce his opposition to secession. Hahn
called the news conference at Van Nuys City Hall to highlight the
defection of such a prominent secessionist.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm opposing secession because I feel it is not good for Van
Nuys," Schultz said. "When they divided Van Nuys into six Valley
council districts, we were betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Lucente, head of the 2,300-household Studio City Residents
Assn. said his members will consider withdrawing from Valley VOTE at
a meeting later this month. Like others who joined the group because
they favored studying secession and giving residents the right to
vote, the association must now decide if its members support cityhood
for the Valley outright.</TE>
<TE>   "We participated in the effort to seek a study of secession,"
Lucente said. "But they have moved into a position of advocacy....
I'm very uncomfortable having the 2,300 member-households of our
association listed as supporting [cityhood] when they have not."</TE>
<TE>   Other area leaders--including former U.S. Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, a
longtime secession supporter, and former Valley VOTE board members
Lee Alpert and Rob Glushon--have backed away from full support of the
secession proposal headed for the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Even David Fleming, the Studio City attorney who helped fund the
campaign to bring secession before the voters and is viewed as a key
ally, said this week that he had not decided whether to vote for the
proposal this fall, or to help fund the campaign in favor of Valley
cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   "This happens in politics all the time," said Richard Katz,
chairman of the pro-secession political campaign. "People have really
strong-held beliefs until they have to make a decision. And then they
have to find out if they really believe what they've been saying."</TE>
<TE>   Katz said he expects people on both sides of the issue to change
their minds as they consider the implications of secession, which
would wrest 40% of the population--and half the city's white
residents--out of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But he urged supporters not to be dissuaded by minor flaws in the
plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an old adage about not letting the perfect get in the way
of the good," Katz said. "You can always find a reason to delay
change."</TE>
<TE>   Alpert, a Northridge attorney who is a former Valley VOTE board
member and a winner of the Valley's Fernando Award for volunteerism
and community service, said that information about the proposed new
city's finances is too sketchy for him to sign on wholeheartedly.</TE>
<TE>   He is concerned, for example, that Los Angeles would raise water
rates for Valley residents, despite a decision by the Local Agency
Formation Commission, which is overseeing the secession process, to
require Los Angeles to provide water and power to a new Valley city
at the same rates it charges its own residents. L.A. officials say
that they don't have to abide by such a rule, and suggest that they
may indeed raise rates for Valley customers if need be.</TE>
<TE>   "The [LAFCO] report is in many instances very generic," Alpert
said. "It doesn't give me the specifics I need."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than stay on with Valley VOTE, Alpert helped to form a new
organization, the Civic Forum, whose members pledge to remain neutral
on secession. Lucente has also joined the group, which aims to funnel
impartial information on secession to voters.</TE>
<TE>   Glushon is another former Valley VOTE board member, and the
group's onetime lawyer. He, too, "leaned" toward secession, because
it fits with his political belief that local control of government is
more democratic, and gives the average person a greater voice.</TE>
<TE>   But, said Glushon, "while I still believe in that conceptually,
you could say that I am undecided, where I was leaning in favor
before."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason for his caution, he said, is concern that a
municipal breakup of this size has never before been attempted.
"There's no question that a separate Valley city would result in
greater local control," said Glushon, a former L.A. City Charter
reform commissioner who says he supports the neighborhood councils
set up under charter reform.</TE>
<TE>   "But I am concerned that when you hear the debate from people who
are for cityhood, they compare the city of Los Angeles to governments
in Burbank, Agoura Hills or Calabasas, and the size of the new city
of San Fernando Valley is not comparable to those smaller cities,"
Glushon said. "You're still going to have government, you're going to
have lots and lots of employees, and you're going to have lots of
politicians."</TE>
<TE>   Such concerns are not surprising, said political consultant Joseph
Cerrell. It is not uncommon, Cerrell said, for political leaders and
others involved in populist movements to strongly embrace views that
are somewhat radical at first, only to retrench a bit later.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a clock pendulum," Cerrell said. "It settles in the
middle."</TE>

<HD>Council Districts Redrawn to Benefit Valley, Latinos</HD>
<DH>Redistricting: Galanter walks out of meeting after she
loses her Westside base to Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city lawmakers Tuesday voted to redraw the city's 15
council district boundaries to give the San Fernando Valley and
Latinos more clout and to eliminate a Westside seat.</LD>
<LD>   The council voted 14 to 0 to create a fifth district in the
Valley--a move that will give Latinos a plurality in five districts,
compared with four now.</LD>
<LD>   The council's once-a-decade redistricting usually brings to a head
political animosities and agendas--and this year was no exception.
But the effort this time was shadowed by the city's secession
movements, which are seeking to break the Valley and Hollywood away
from Los Angeles and which most council members oppose.</LD>
<TE>   To create another Valley district, the council moved the 6th
District, now consisting of parts of West Los Angeles, Venice and
Crenshaw, to the East Valley. Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who has
represented the Westside for 15 years, will start work in her new
district next month.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, much of Galanter's old domain will be merged into
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski's newly configured 11th Council
District.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter had sought to delay the changes until her term ends next
year, arguing that it disenfranchises voters who have elected her to
represent them since 1987. But the council majority, voting 9 to 6,
said they wanted the new districts to take effect on the same
schedule as in past years, a month after the council adopts the
redistricting plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is ... about the Valley getting its fair share," said
Councilwoman Wendy Greuel. "Democracy delayed to me is democracy
denied."</TE>
<TE>   Galanter, who walked out before the council took the final vote on
the new boundaries, countered that her colleagues "chose political
expediency over representative democracy."</TE>
<TE>   "Today, the Los Angeles City Council ignored the needs and wishes
of thousands of Los Angeles residents by voting to implement the new
council district boundaries immediately, instead of waiting for
community residents to select their own representatives," Galanter
said.</TE>
<TE>   'A Sacrificial Lamb'</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of her supporters urged the council to allow Galanter to
serve out her term representing the people who elected her. Some also
thought that the redistricting was a carrot being offered to Valley
residents to vote against breaking away from Los Angeles in November.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like our community is being a sacrificial lamb for this
whole process of secession," said Judy May, who has lived in the
Westchester area for 34 years.</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Jack Weiss, who headed the council's redistricting
committee, said he believes the changes were necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important that the council sends a message that the
interests and concerns of one council member in this new council will
not carry the day," Weiss said. "What matters is what is best for the
greatest number of people in the city: that the Valley get its
representative right away and everyone get equal representation right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close, who was a member of the
citizens redistricting group that originally drafted the boundaries,
said the council should have given the Valley another seat more than
a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   And even with the fifth seat, "the political muscle is still south
of Mulholland Drive," Close said. "With a Valley city, we will have
14 of 14 council seats."</TE>
<TE>   The council, acting on the advice of a special citizens committee,
redraws its district boundaries every 10 years to reflect new census
data. City officials said population shifts over the past decade
meant that the elimination of Galanter's district and the creation of
a district in the East Valley were inevitable. The moves are intended
to ensure that Los Angeles residents have equal representation in
city government.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan approved by the council, the 1st, 7th, 13th, 14th
and new 6th districts will have about 40% Latino voter registration
or more, giving that ethnic community a plurality of voters. The
council also ratified boundaries that maintain three districts in
which African American voters constitute a plurality, the same as
now.</TE>
<TE>   And in a last-minute compromise, Councilman Nick Pacheco told his
colleagues Tuesday that he was no longer seeking to take parts of
Councilwoman Jan Perry's downtown district.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Pacheco, who represents parts of Eagle Rock and Boyle
Heights, had sought to extend his district farther into downtown by
taking over City Hall and surrounding areas. Perry, however, launched
a battle to keep her district intact--packing the council chambers
Tuesday with hundreds of supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said he abandoned his plans because he was worried that a
bitter fight with Perry would help secession efforts in the San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "While uniting communities of interest in downtown is important, I
believe that a united City Council during a secession campaign is
more important," Pacheco wrote to his colleagues. "Unfortunately, a
close vote on the downtown boundaries may damage our effort to keep
this great city together, and I will have no part in furthering the
secessionist goals."</TE>
<TE>   Perry, who believed that she had enough votes to thwart Pacheco's
effort, praised his decision. "I'm so glad he was so gracious," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Schatz, who heads the Central City Assn. and who fought
Pacheco's plan, said she is pleased that the fight is over.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tremendous and hard- fought victory for downtown
unity," Schatz said. "Jan Perry will keep the downtown renaissance
moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Also resolved was a dispute over the boundary between the 8th and
10th districts. Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the 8th, said Nate
Holden in the 10th was attempting to swipe several community
landmarks for his district.</TE>
<TE>   Plan Is Approved</TE>
<TE>   The council approved Ridley-Thomas' plan, which keeps the First
AME Church, Baldwin Hills Shopping Center, Trinity Baptist Church and
Loren Miller Park in the 8th District.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Holden warned members who voted against him that
their decisions could haunt them.</TE>
<TE>   "To those who think they can wheel and deal on a given day and not
have it be remembered, you are in for a rude awakening," Holden said.
"The forces of the universe will address that issue."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A pedestrian struck by an out-of-control car in Hollywood is
considered brain-dead, and her mother--hit at the same time--is in
serious condition, Los Angeles police said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Catherine Williams, 22, was on life support at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, but is not expected to live, said Det. Antonio Lee.
Williams' mother, Gloria, 55, also was at Cedars-Sinai.</LD>
<LD>   The two were standing at a phone booth on the west side of
Highland Avenue, just south of Hollywood Boulevard, when the accident
occurred at 7:15 p.m. Monday, police said. Marcos Salaman, 55, who
was driving north on Highland, veered across the center line, ran up
on the sidewalk and hit the women, police said. Salaman, who suffered
lesser injuries, also was hospitalized.</LD>
<TE>   In the event of Catherine Williams' death, a charge of felony
vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence will be pursued, Lee
said. Toxicology screenings showed that Salaman was not under the
influence of alcohol or drugs, police said.</TE>

<HD>4 Arrested in Slaying of 14-Year-Old</HD>

<LD>Garden Grove police have arrested four high school students in the
slaying of a 14-year-old who was gunned down last weekend after
taking a cab home from an Internet cafe.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation is continuing, but police are treating the
killing of Edward Fernandez as gang-related, said Sgt. Mike Handfield
of the Garden Grove Police Department. Fernandez was not connected to
gangs, but the suspects have ties to local gangs and are believed to
have acted in concert to kill the youth, Handfield said. Although
police are not sure who among them was the shooter, all will be
charged with murder.</LD>
<LD>   "These people acted together in either formulating a plan or in
following the taxi to kill Fernandez," Handfield said. "It could be
the driving, the shooting or the following of the taxi--they are all
chargeable with murder."</LD>
<TE>   Police said witness statements led them to the four, but would not
give details. One suspect was arrested Sunday, the other three
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Tho That Ton, 18, is scheduled to be arraigned today. He was
charged with homicide with gang enhancement and is being held without
bail. Ron Le and Jack San, both 18, are in police custody pending
filing of homicide charges, said Lt. Scott Hamilton. Another Garden
Grove teenager was arrested, but his name was not released because he
is a minor. All attend Bolsa Grande High School in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez and six friends had spent the evening at the I.C.E.
Internet Cafe in the 12200 block of Brookhurst Street. Fernandez
arrived about 6:30 p.m. to watch the NBA finals and was in and out of
the cafe, returning the last time about midnight before leaving with
three friends in a cab, said manager Quang Nguyen, who worked the
night shift Friday.</TE>
<TE>   As they waited for their cab, Fernandez and his friends reportedly
exchanged hostile looks with people in a car in the cafe parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Eyewitnesses said several cars followed the cab. A passenger in a
black car approached the taxi as soon as it stopped in the 12500
block of Adelle Street, witnesses said. The gunman stood by the taxi
and shot Fernandez several times while the victim paid the fare.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting prompted city officials to heighten the enforcement
of regulations governing cyber cafes. The city instituted rules for
such establishments in January, after the Dec. 30 stabbing death of a
20-year-old outside the PC Cafe on Garden Grove Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current ordinance, cyber cafes must close by 2 a.m.,
have security cameras and keep minors away after 10 p.m. Fridays and
Saturdays and after 8 p.m. on other nights. Police said the ordinance
might have been violated in the recent incident.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen said that Fernandez and his friends were not at the cafe
the entire evening and that all the minors left about 11 p.m., after
he called the police about a group of teenagers in cars who were
intimidating customers outside. The teenagers dispersed when police
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   It was not known whether they were the same people who later
followed Fernandez's cab.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen said that Fernandez and his friends returned to the cafe
about midnight and that he told them they could not stay.</TE>

<HD>Suspect's Trip to Movies Is Just the Ticket for Officials,
Who Arrest Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An alleged drug kingpin who bought a ticket to "The Sum of All Fears"
may have realized his own a few minutes later when he was arrested at
a movie theater in Long Beach, the U.S. marshal's office said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Darrell Dwight Bellamy, 33, is suspected of heading a narcotics
network that distributed more than 150 kilograms of cocaine and half
a ton of marijuana in Arizona, Oklahoma, Illinois and Michigan over
about eight years, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   He is accused by a grand jury in Tulsa, Okla., of torturing a
woman by dipping her feet in boiling oil and branding her arm with a
hot iron after she lost more than $291,000 in drug receipts.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Marshal Kurt Ellingson said marshals followed Bellamy from
a nearby home to the AMC theaters on Pine Avenue on Monday afternoon
after receiving a tip on his whereabouts from investigators in
Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "He purchased a ticket and disappeared inside," Ellingson said.</TE>
<TE>   Marshals quickly checked with the box office, determined which
movie Bellamy was watching and unobtrusively entered the back of the
theater, Ellingson said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was watching a showing that was almost over," Ellingson said.
"As he got up to leave, we blocked his exit, handcuffed him quietly
and took him outside. I don't think most of the people in that
theater ever realized what had happened."</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy is awaiting arraignment in Los Angeles before his
scheduled return to Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Greer, an assistant U.S. attorney in Tulsa, said that during
his months on the run, Bellamy gambled away about $3 million in Las
Vegas in an unsuccessful attempt to launder his alleged drug profits.
Bellamy was added to the marshals' "15 Most Wanted List" in April.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Bellamy allegedly employed more than 20
"mules," couriers who transported drugs by plane and automobile and
then returned with the proceeds. The female courier reportedly was
tortured when she was suspected of stealing drug money. In reality,
she apparently lost the money in a robbery, officials said. Five of
Bellamy's purported accomplices went on trial last week in Tulsa.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Cop Durden Gets Three Years</HD>
<DH>Rampart: Rafael Perez's partner is sentenced for civil
rights and weapon violations as part of a plea bargain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rafael Perez's co-defendant in the Rampart police corruption scandal
was sentenced to three years in prison Tuesday for violating federal
civil rights laws and possessing an illicit weapon that was used to
frame an innocent man.</LD>
<LD>   Former Los Angeles Police Officer Nino Durden bowed his head as
U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder pronounced the sentence, the
outgrowth of a plea bargain with prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Durden declined an offer to address the court. But in a recent
letter to the judge, the 33-year-old former cop wrote: "My mistakes,
though serious, are not representative of the true person that I am.
I will live with the shame of my poor judgment forever."</LD>
<TE>   Snyder also ordered Durden to pay $281,010 in restitution, mostly
to cover the cost of prosecuting and imprisoning two people who were
falsely convicted of trumped-up charges.</TE>
<TE>   Durden, who remains free on $50,000 bail, was given 60 days to
surrender. He also is awaiting sentencing in Los Angeles County
Superior Court on his guilty pleas to six Rampart-related charges.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who sparked the Rampart police corruption probe after he
was caught stealing cocaine from a police evidence locker, was
sentenced in the same federal courtroom last month to two years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Both men made plea deals in which they promised to cooperate in an
ongoing FBI investigation of other Rampart officers.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Mary Carter Andrues, who heads the probe,
declined to say Tuesday whether additional prosecutions are expected.</TE>
<TE>   Perez reportedly implicated about 70 Rampart officers in what he
said was a pattern of misconduct involving illegal beatings,
shootings and false arrests of suspected gang members.</TE>
<TE>   So far, more than 100 criminal convictions have been overturned
because of Perez's admissions and more than a dozen LAPD officers
have resigned or been fired. But besides Perez and Durden, only a few
have been prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court Tuesday, Durden's lawyer, Bill Seki, said Perez's
claims of widespread misconduct in the Rampart Division were
exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   "The scandal that people talked about was not as far-reaching as
Perez and members of the press made it out to be," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Seki said Durden gave this perspective to federal agents and
prosecutors during numerous debriefing sessions after his guilty plea
in April 2001 to three separate acts of misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The most high-profile episode was the framing of Javier Francisco
Ovando, a former 18th Street gang member, who was shot in the head,
shoulder and hip in 1996 when he walked into a vacant apartment where
Perez and Durden were conducting surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   After realizing that he was unarmed, Perez brought a
short-barreled rifle to the apartment, used a rag to wipe off
fingerprints and placed it close to the wounded Ovando's hands.</TE>
<TE>   According to the plea agreement, the two officers later "practiced
and pantomimed" a tale about how Ovando burst into the apartment with
the assault rifle and was shot in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Ovando, who was left partially paralyzed from the shooting, was
tried, convicted and sentenced to more than 23 years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   The frame-up went undetected until 1999, when Perez was arrested
on the cocaine theft charge and began talking to county prosecutors
about corruption in the Rampart Division.</TE>
<TE>   Perez served three years of a five-year state prison sentence
before being released last year, only to face related federal charges
and another prison term.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ovando case, Durden admitted violating Ovando's civil
rights under color of authority by fabricating evidence, making a
false arrest and lying in court. He also pleaded guilty to possessing
a firearm with an obliterated serial number, the weapon that was
planted next to Ovando.</TE>
<TE>   Durden, who joined the LAPD in 1994, admitted guilt in two other
cases.</TE>
<TE>   On May 25, 1997, he said, he and Perez framed Jose Madrid on a
weapons charge, claiming that the man possessed a fully loaded
.38-caliber handgun when he did not. Madrid pleaded guilty to the
charge and was sentenced to 16 months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   On April 2, 1997, Durden said, he and Perez threatened to arrest
Jorge Toscano and his girlfriend, Cynthia Diaz, unless they revealed
where money was hidden in their apartment. Toscano did so and the two
officers stole $1,300 from him, Durden said. He was ordered Tuesday
to reimburse the couple.</TE>

<HD>Budget Panel Expands Health Insurance Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The legislative committee negotiating a new state budget approved an
expansion of a popular health insurance program Tuesday even as it
struggled to close a $23.6-billion budget gap.</LD>
<LD>   The same committee also approved a proposal sought by Gov. Gray
Davis and Republican legislators to reinstate procedures that require
adults to fill out forms every quarter to remain enrolled in
Medi-Cal. The change, which is opposed by health care advocates for
the poor, is expected to save the state $155 million.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Senate-Assembly budget conference committee split
along party lines in approving a $50-million appropriation so that
the Healthy Families program, which insures low-income children, can
begin covering as many as 300,000 parents starting Oct. 1.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's terrific," said Jim Keddy, executive director of the
Pacific Institute for Community Organization, a coalition of
faith-based groups that has lobbied to expand health coverage for the
uninsured. "For the first time low-income working families will be
able to get health care coverage for the whole family."</TE>
<TE>   Davis announced in January that he would support the expansion of
the program to cover parents but, faced with a growing budget gap, he
did not include money for the expansion in the revised budget he
released last month.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic legislators, particularly in the state Assembly, had
flagged the expansion as a key priority.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration had no comment Tuesday on the action by
the committee, which consists of two Republicans and four Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Ackerman, the Irvine Republican who handles budget
matters for his caucus, voted against the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman also took issue with committee actions to earmark $25
million for trauma centers and $31 million for primarily public and
teaching hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of poor
patients.</TE>
<TE>   The changes must be approved by each house of the Legislature,
which is likely to miss Saturday's deadline for delivering a new
budget to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The conference committee has yet to make decisions on dozens of
spending proposals. It also hasn't settled the politically sensitive
matter of tax increases.</TE>

<HD>Priest on Leave Pending Sex Abuse Investigation</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Catholic parish learns its pastor is accused of
molesting a teen 28 years ago. Police inquiry is underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Father Philip Kavanaugh, a Los Angeles priest known for his support
of progressive causes, has been placed on leave pending a police
investigation into allegations that he molested a teenager almost
three decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Tuesday that the abuse is alleged to have occurred in
Los Angeles, but they would give no details. Kavanaugh is pastor at
Precious Blood Church on Occidental Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   At the time of the alleged incident, he was assigned to the
Cathedral Chapel on South La Brea Avenue, according to the official
Catholic directory.</LD>
<TE>   Kavanaugh is one of 34 current and former priests under
investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, officials there
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are investigating each and every allegation. We take these
allegations very seriously," said Lt. Daniel Mulrenin, head of the
LAPD's Sexually Exploited Child Unit.</TE>
<TE>   Since the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy for sexual abuse by
priests after a lawsuit settlement last year, Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony has placed Kavanaugh and what archdiocese officials say is a
"handful" of other priests on leave while they are under suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, priests facing such allegations were left in their
rectories or sent away for therapy with little explanation to
parishioners. The archdiocese now announces why Kavanaugh and other
priests are absent from the pulpit and tells parishioners when a
priest formerly assigned to their church is facing claims of sexual
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Chris Cox, vicar of the clergy, told Precious Blood
parishioners last month: "It is my sad duty to announce that we have
received a report of an incident of inappropriate behavior with a
teenager involving Philip Kavanaugh. The report involves an incident
more than 25 years ago. Let me first ask that you keep him in your
prayers. This is a very difficult time for him."</TE>
<TE>   According to a copy of the statement provided by the archdiocese,
Cox reminded parishioners that every accused person is innocent until
there is proof to the contrary, but he said the church takes all such
allegations seriously. He also said he wished he could provide more
information, but he had to respect the rights of those involved.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, archdiocese spokesman, said the allegation against
Kavanaugh was reported to the archdiocese hotline on sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Kavanaugh did not return telephone calls. In a statement read by
Cox to parishioners, he said: "It is with great sadness that I must
inform you that a report of inappropriate behavior on my part has
been received by the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "The incident reportedly took place 28 years ago. Let me assure
you I have not been a threat to young people at Precious Blood
parish. However, due to the nature of the accusation, I must be put
on administrative leave."</TE>
<TE>   Kavanaugh apologized for any "embarrassment" this may cause
parishioners and asked them "to have faith that in some mysterious
way, God will ultimately bring great good out of this very painful
time for us."</TE>
<TE>   Ordained in 1973, Kavanaugh also has worked at Christ the King
Church in Richland, Wash., St. Maria Goretti Church in Long Beach and
San Roque Church in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   As Precious Blood's pastor since 1996, Kavanaugh has made the
church an active part of the Faith Communities for Families and
Children, a coalition that advocates for children.</TE>
<TE>   He also helped organize a Los Angeles mayoral debate in March with
the L.A. METRO-Industrial Arias Foundation, a federation of about 80
religious congregations, unions and organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials have not made public the names of the
priests on leave because of allegations of sexual abuse. But they
include Msgr. Christian Van Liefde of St. Genevieve Church in
Panorama City, Father Honesto Bismonte of St. Joseph Church in Pomona
and Father David Granadino of St. Frances of Rome Church in Azusa.</TE>

<HD>Crews Make Inroads Against Wildfires</HD>
<DH>Blazes: Officials say it was a quiet day as winds fanned a
few hotspots. The Copper fire near Saugus is contained.</DH>

<LD>Strong breezes fanned new hot spots across the Sespe Wilderness on
Tuesday, but the 22,000-acre wildfire in Los Padres National Forest
north of Ojai failed to gain much ground, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been quiet all day," said Jim Renshaw, an engineer with the
Ventura County Fire Department. "There are a few areas that have
acted up because it got drier and hotter again."</LD>
<LD>   Another large blaze, the 23,400-acre Copper fire in the Angeles
National Forest near Saugus, was declared 100% contained Tuesday
night. Firefighters "will be working the hot spots for the next
couple of days," said Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman
Mark Savage. "But we've cut a fuel break completely around it."</LD>
<TE>   The blaze, started last Wednesday by sparks from a welder's torch,
had threatened to burn down the 1,100-resident community of Green
Valley. Nine homes were lost.</TE>
<TE>   Fire crews at Tuesday morning's planning session for the fire near
Ojai said two hand crews cutting fire lines on each side of the blaze
made significant progress overnight even as the small flare-ups
continued to burn.</TE>
<TE>   The fire remained 75% contained, and officials expected to have it
under control by Friday evening. Several helicopters used to fight
the fire were unable to take off Tuesday morning because of dense fog
in Ojai but were airborne by noon, Renshaw said. The cause of the
blaze, which began June 1 along California 33 about 12 miles north of
Ojai, has not been determined. The fire has cost federal, state and
local agencies $11.9 million. About 1,000 firefighters are still on
the lines, Renshaw said.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters' base camp in Ojai's Soule Park will remain at
least through June 21.</TE>

<DH>Oxnard: Tenants lift spirits and improve public housing's
image with bounty of blooms.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first thing visitors notice at La Colonia Village, a public
housing project in Oxnard, are the flowers.</LD>
<LD>   There are brilliant orange orchids, baby pink gladiolas and deep
red roses. Then there are the faint aromas, like the sweet smell of
rosemary and the fragrant allure of jasmine.</LD>
<LD>   The lively blooms and the lush gardens they sprout from are the
proud handiwork of farm workers, retired seniors and others who live
at La Colonia Village and at 11 other public housing projects
throughout the city.</LD>
<TE>   They are all participants in a lawn beautification program
launched five years ago by the Oxnard Housing Authority. The program
was created to inspire pride in communities often considered
unattractive or undesirable, housing officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Participation has jumped to 80% of the city's more than 3,000
public housing residents since the program began. The authority holds
an annual gardening contest and awards small cash prizes--ranging
from $50 to $200. The winners of this year's contest will be
announced today.</TE>
<TE>   Officials see the program as an investment in the community.
Residents say they tend to their gardens more out of respect for
their neighborhood and one another than for the prizes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always liked having flowers, and while I live here, I have
to make it as nice as possible," said Juanita Cortez, 63, a retired
farm worker. "A lot of people say, 'Why bother? It's not mine.' But
you have to like where you live and make it look nice."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, gardening keeps her active, and it makes her feel good
when neighbors compliment her work, Cortez said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I couldn't garden, I would get sad," Cortez said. "A house
without flowers just isn't right."</TE>
<TE>   Cortez lives near Eliza Court in La Colonia Village, where the
lawn beautification program began. Since then, officials said, both
the landscape and atmosphere of the neighborhood have improved.</TE>
<TE>   "This used to be the most troubled street in public housing," said
Melissa Mendez, the city's public housing manager. "We call it the
domino effect because people are recognized for the good they do and
it's contagious. Everybody started planting and picking up trash."</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Moreno--affectionately known in La Colonia as "Don
Panchito"--shows off his yard with obvious pride.</TE>
<TE>   The front lawn is accented with palm trees, and flaming red roses
and cactus plants line a fence in the back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame it's not my house, because I remember we always had
flowers at home growing up," he said. "But I have pride in being
here."</TE>
<TE>   The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development leaves the
decision of establishing such gardening programs to individual
housing authorities, officials said. For Oxnard, the decision was
easy, said Mary Gavia-Barajas, a supervisor with the Oxnard Housing
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The flowers help lift spirits and improve the image of the
community, "so people don't look at public housing as 'Oh, the
projects,' " she said. "We want people to be excited about living
here because they deserve it."</TE>

<TE>   Besides, gardening keeps her active, and it makes her feel good

<TE>   She also finds it therapeutic. When she needs a pick-me-up, she

<TE>   Her biggest smiles come when neighbors occasionally stop by on
Sunday afternoons to take family pictures in her garden.</TE>
<TE>   As a little girl growing up in Mexico, Cortez said she picked
flowers from her backyard and ran to give them to her mother. Now she
picks them from her home in La Colonia and places them on her
mother's grave in the city's Santa Clara Cemetery, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I couldn't garden, I would get sad," Cortez said. "A house

<TE>   Francisco Moreno--affectionately known in La Colonia as "Don

residents, he shows off his yard with obvious pride.</TE>
<TE>   The front lawn is a deep patch of green accented with four palm
trees. In the back, flaming red rose trees--a neighborhood
favorite--and cactus plants line a chain-link fence and red brick
tiles that Moreno laid down to give his sidewalk an extra splash of
color.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame it's not my house, because I remember we always had

<HD>Westerfield's Behavior Suspicious, Officer Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Police initially became suspicious of David Westerfield because he
appeared nervous and "overly cooperative" during routine questioning,
a San Diego detective testified Tuesday at Westerfield's trial for
the kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield also provoked suspicion when he volunteered to a
detective: "I could have sworn she had a baby-sitter. I didn't know
her husband was home with the kids." Det. Johnny Keene testified: "I
hadn't asked him about that."</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors allege that Westerfield sneaked into the Van Dam home
about midnight Feb. 1 and kidnapped the child from her bedroom while
her father, Damon, slept in an adjacent room. Westerfield earlier had
been at a neighborhood bar, where his advances to the girl's mother,
Brenda van Dam, and her friends were spurned, witnesses had
testified.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Steven Feldman suggested that the detectives
searched Westerfield's home illegally. But Keene and fellow San Diego
police Det. Maura Parga said Westerfield signed a consent form
allowing the search.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield was arrested Feb. 22, three weeks after Danielle's
disappearance. Prosecutors contend that Danielle's blood, hair and
fingerprints were found in Westerfield's recreational vehicle and
home.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman asserts that the blood, hair and fingerprints may have
been left by Danielle when she and her mother came to Westerfield's
home to sell Girl Scout cookies the week she disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Keene testified that Westerfield, in his first interview with
police, said Danielle had run upstairs in his home during the Girl
Scout sales visit. Brenda van Dam had testified that Danielle
remained downstairs and in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Keene testified that when he interviewed Westerfield two days
after Danielle disappeared, the 50-year-old design engineer appeared
nervous, sweated profusely although the day was cool and was
suspiciously solicitous.</TE>
<TE>   "As we were searching his residence, he pointed out areas that we
might walk past and miss and he felt we should look at," Keene said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Brenda and Damon van Dam were allowed to sit
in the courtroom audience. Superior Court Judge William Mudd had
ruled that until they finished their testimony, they could not attend
the trial.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified Cuts $31 Million More</HD>
<DH>Education: This round of trims is less contentious because
it targets central office and maintenance, not classrooms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Board of Education on Tuesday cut $31.2 million more
from next year's budget, mainly targeting central office functions
and some maintenance positions.</LD>
<LD>   The latest cutbacks come after the Los Angeles Unified School
District previously shaved $384.8 million in an effort to meet a
total shortfall of more than $430 million. The district says those
cuts are needed to balance its budget of $5.2 billion in general
funds for the next fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the previous cuts will increase some class sizes and
reduce some academic support staff. In contrast, Tuesday's actions
will have a minimal effect on classrooms, according to district
officials.</LD>
<TE>   Board members voted to cut the inspector general's budget, delay
the purchase of school police vehicles and eliminate 90 school
maintenance positions, among other actions.</TE>
<TE>   The board worked through the proposed reductions relatively
quickly, in contrast to a contentious 12-hour budget session in late
April when it debated the more controversial measures.</TE>
<TE>   ''These cuts were a little easier to swallow,'' said board member
Jose Huizar, after Tuesday's budget session.</TE>
<TE>   The board put off votes on $15 million in additional reductions
until its June 20 meeting. Among those proposals is a plan to bus
some students to campuses early so the vehicles can make a second
trip on the same mornings. The board will also review possible cuts
to a program that rewards National Board Certified teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer urged everyone to make hard sacrifices.</TE>
<TE>   ''We've got to put the pressure on everyone in this district to
find cuts,'' he said. And he said the cuts have to be deep enough to
enable the district to negotiate health benefits and pay increases
with its employees.</TE>
<TE>   United Teachers-Los Angeles and several other large school unions,
currently seeking raises in new contracts, held a news conference
Monday to complain that the district did not pay its employees
enough.</TE>
<TE>   District Budget Director Lorenzo Tyner said he was worried that
there would be little left to slash if the board rejected the
remaining proposals later this month.</TE>
<TE>   ''We were scraping the bottom of the barrel with these cuts,'' he

<HD>This Time, Uranga Wins in Long Beach</HD>
<DH>Election: Her narrow victory in a runoff for City Council
seat is a rematch of her loss to Donelon in a 1994 race to represent
7th District.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tonia Reyes Uranga beat Mike Donelon by 58 votes for the Long Beach
City Council's 7th District seat, based on a final count Tuesday of
absentee ballots from last week's election.</LD>
<LD>   Donelon has five days to request a recount. His campaign
consultant said he didn't know whether Donelon, who is in Mexico,
would do that. Uranga could not be reached.</LD>
<LD>   It is the second close call for the two candidates in an election.
Eight years ago, Donelon beat Uranga by one vote for the same council
seat. She requested a recount and eventually filed a lawsuit
challenging the results.</LD>
<TE>   A judge called for a new election, which Donelon won by a larger
margin.</TE>
<TE>   The June 4 city election decided only three offices: the council
seat, a school board seat and mayor. It was the mayor's race that
drew the most attention because of its weird twists.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Beverly O'Neill had sought reelection, but city term
limits only allowed her to run as a write-in. She placed first in the
April primary, but because she couldn't appear on the ballot the
second-place finisher had the ballot to himself in June. A second
write-in campaign was launched by the primary's third-place finisher.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill won the mayoral race. But with 5,200 ballots
uncounted--mostly absentees turned in at polls after 1 p.m. on
election day--the council race was too close to call.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's election was a runoff because neither Donelon nor
Uranga won 50% of the primary vote. In votes counted by last
Wednesday, Uranga led Donelon by 16 votes.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonia ran a good race," said Donelon's campaign consultant, Jeff
Adler, who also worked on Donelon's campaign eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Without a breakdown of voter turnout by precinct, Adler said, the
result suggests the 7th District to be an area of transition. The
California Heights portion where Donelon is strong is largely white;
the west side is primarily Latino and African American, Adler said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the election speaks to changing demographics in Long
Beach," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're beginning to see the Latino population emerging
[at the poll]," he said. "Uranga campaigned very heavily that it ...
was important to have a Latino on the council."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Ray Grabinski's endorsement of Uranga surely helped
her, but Adler said as a Latina she also succeeded in a
non-Latino-dominated district.</TE>
<TE>   "That means low-propensity voters turned out, and that would be
Latinos in that district," Adler said. "I gotta believe she did a
good job of turning them out" at the polls.</TE>

<LD>Aurelio Marquez, 18, remembers hearing it from the time he was a
young boy. Hit the books, said his father the carpenter and his
mother the homemaker, so you can get into a good college.</LD>
<LD>   The community of South Gate does not send armies of students
marching off to elite universities. But Aurelio's older sister Blanca
got into USC three years ago, and Aurelio had read something about
the Ivy League when he was a pup of 8 or 9. That, he decided, was
where he belonged.</LD>
<LD>   "I pictured myself in my room at college, working on a paper and
seeing the snow fall outside my window," says Aurelio.</LD>
<TE>   His parents, Aurelio and Blanca, came up from Mexico specifically
to raise this kind of hope. They passed their own first names on to
their children and sent them to Catholic schools all the way through.
For Mr. Marquez, this meant working Saturdays to pay the tuition. For
Mrs. Marquez, it meant piling up service hours at the schools and
doing without certain things.</TE>
<TE>   "The least I could do in return," says Aurelio, "was to excel."</TE>
<TE>   And so he did.</TE>
<TE>   "He's unassuming," says Monica Carreon, Aurelio's counselor at Don
Bosco Tech, a Salesian high school in Rosemead. "But I knew his
potential through his grades and his SATs."</TE>
<TE>   One day Aurelio walked into Carreon's office and told her he
wanted to major in business, and according to his research, the best
business school was at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   An Ivy League school.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to encourage students with that kind of ambition, but
you want them to be realistic too," Carreon says.</TE>
<TE>   She told Aurelio that Penn was outrageously expensive, very tough
to get into and a long, long way from home. "Do you even know what
snow looks like?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Go ahead and apply, Carreon told him, but try a few other colleges
too. Just in case.</TE>
<TE>   It was not necessary. Of the 19,000 high school students
nationally who applied to Penn, 2,385 got in.</TE>
<TE>   Aurelio Marquez was one of them, and he got a scholarship to cover
most of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   It's just after 7 a.m. the day I arrive at Aurelio's home to drive
him to his last day of regular classes at Bosco.</TE>
<TE>   The two Blancas answer, one as proud as the other. Aurelio's
mother tells me she is very pleased, but heartbroken too, in
anticipation of her son's departure in August.</TE>
<TE>   I stand in their gracious home and think to myself, it's this
simple. In a country that suffers endlessly over the failures of
education, the answers are here with the Marquez family of South
Gate. Hard work, high hopes, sacrifice, parental involvement. With a
big assist, in this case, from the Catholic schools.</TE>
<TE>   And now Aurelio enters the room wearing a necktie, not because he
has to, but because he is his parents' son. He's tall and thin, and
there is both humility and confidence in brown eyes that sparkle with
possibility. His mother hands him his lunch, and we're on our way.</TE>
<TE>   Once we get to school, Principal Guillermo Gutierrez will sing
Aurelio's praises.</TE>
<TE>   Antonia Elenes, Aurelio's Spanish teacher and mentor, will tell me
about Aurelio coming by her office for lunch most days, the two of
them talking about his Ivy League aspirations and Elenes telling him,
"You can do it, you can do it, you can do it."</TE>
<TE>   I'll meet Aurelio's buddy Osvaldo Ojeda, who's going to Yale, and
he'll tell me the plan. If they get heartsick for a familiar face,
they'll each get on a train, Osvaldo heading south from Connecticut
and Aurelio heading north from Pennsylvania, and meet in New York
City.</TE>
<TE>   Aurelio will show me the grassy quad in the center of his
campus--the quad no one is allowed to walk across because, as
students are instructed the first day of freshman year at Bosco,
"There are no shortcuts in life."</TE>
<TE>   But it's the drive to Bosco that I enjoy the most, maybe because I
used to drive my two sons to high school each morning in
Philadelphia, where Aurelio will soon live. He's very excited,
Aurelio tells me, but as the day of departure draws near, "I'm more
nervous too."</TE>
<TE>   He asks if there are good Mexican restaurants in Philadelphia, and
at the cost of breaking his heart, I cannot tell a lie. One or two, I
tell him. "But it won't taste like home."</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there's nothing like your mother's cooking," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But that's part of the deal. Aurelio says he wanted an adventure,
a new culture, the whole bit. And besides, his father has told him
about having to leave home one year in Mexico because there was no
secondary school in the rural area where he lived. "He said he
learned a lot, and really matured the year he was gone."</TE>
<TE>   Aurelio says he'll have to work like the devil the first year of
college so he can then transfer into Wharton, Penn's business school.
"I need a 3.5 grade point average, but I think I can do it."</TE>
<TE>   I sit there thinking about what a great thing it is to be 18, to
have worked for a moment like this and to be filled with wonder and
nervous anticipation.</TE>
<TE>   Aurelio says he hasn't decided yet on a specific career, but if he
really makes it one day and has money in his pockets, he knows what
he'll do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll buy my parents a huge house," he says. "I wouldn't be here
if not for them."</TE>

<HD>Jail Houdini Can't Escape From Prison Term</HD>
<DH>Sentence: Man who slipped out of his cell and picked the
locks of his restraints gets 12 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spencer Moss escaped from a maximum-security jail cell and slipped
out of handcuffs and leg shackles in a Ventura County courtroom after
picking the restraints' locks with a wad of toilet paper and the
tooth of a comb.</LD>
<LD>   But the clever inmate couldn't maneuver his way out of a 12-year
prison sentence Tuesday for two counts of attempted escape by force.</LD>
<LD>   At his hearing, Moss, a 36-year-old Carpinteria resident who acted
as his own attorney, insisted that he was the victim of sneaky
tactics by the court, and not the other way around.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe I didn't get a fair trial," Moss said, accusing the
judge and law enforcement officials of violating his constitutional
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Chained at the waist and surrounded by five deputies, Moss, a
rail-thin defendant with a mop of curly brown hair and a wiry beard,
alleged that he had been falsely imprisoned. He said deputies
illegally searched his paperwork and denied him access to a lawyer.
He said the probation report was fraudulent and the judge biased.</TE>
<TE>   Moss asked for a new trial. But Superior Court Judge Art Gutierrez
denied the request and ordered Moss sent to prison for a maximum term
of 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Ryan Wright said sheriff's officials were so
eager to get rid of the slippery Moss that they planned to put him on
a bus to prison within an hour of sentencing. "He has been a constant
headache and a problem for them," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   In two years in jail, Moss racked up 64 security violations that
included hiding contraband in his ears and swallowing screws from a
jail sink. Wright said there have been at least eight more violations
since the probation report was written.</TE>
<TE>   "I get daily updates," he said. "Somebody like this just doesn't
want to play by someone else's rules, and that makes him an extreme
danger to society."</TE>
<TE>   Moss would likely dispute that characterization.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a jury acquitted him of car theft after a trial in
which he represented himself. Authorities later arrested him on
suspicion of writing a bad check. Moss landed in the maximum-security
unit of the county's main jail after breaking jail rules, Wright
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moss' first attempted escape occurred Jan. 24. Two deputies were
moving him from one cell to another when one noticed Moss had
hurriedly flushed something down his toilet. Afraid it might be
contraband, the deputy checked the toilet while leaving Moss with his
partner.</TE>
<TE>   When she moved toward the cell door, Moss scooted past her and
slammed the door shut, locking both deputies inside, Wright said.
Handcuffed, Moss ran down the hallway, tried to force open other
doors and bumped into a third deputy. An inmate eventually tackled
him. The incident was caught on videotape.</TE>
<TE>   The second escape attempt occurred Jan. 31, when Moss unlocked his
leg shackles and handcuffs during a court appearance on the bad check
case. Deputies tackled Moss after he threw the shackles in the
direction of a court reporter. Wright said authorities later
determined that Moss had picked the locks with toilet paper and a
piece of a comb.</TE>
<TE>   Moss was charged with two counts of attempted escape and one count
of battery for running into the deputy during the jail incident. At
trial, the videotape was shown to jurors. They also saw a detailed
map of the jail floor plan that authorities had seized during a
search of Moss' cell.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really well done," Wright said. "He had arrows going from
his cell to each of the exits. That is really what convicted him."</TE>
<TE>   After a weeklong trial, jurors convicted Moss of the attempted
escape charges but deadlocked on the battery count, which was
dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said Moss' antics continued up to trial. Before court one
day, he said, deputies searched Moss' ear and found a piece of
tinfoil, fashioned into a handcuff key.</TE>

<LD>A Canadian man was arrested Tuesday after authorities said they found
124 pounds of high-grade marijuana in a van he was driving.</LD>
<LD>   The California Highway Patrol arrested Chung Thompson after a
traffic stop on the San Diego Freeway, said Orlando Lopez, a Bureau
of Narcotics Enforcement agent.</LD>
<LD>   The marijuana had a wholesale value of more than $600,000 and a
street value in the millions of dollars, Lopez said.</LD>
<TE>   The marijuana was a potent type grown in Canada that sells for
about 10 times the price of Mexican-grown marijuana, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, 30, was charged with possession of marijuana for sale
and transportation of marijuana for sale.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison. He is being

<LD>A task force studying whether San Clemente High School should be
renovated or rebuilt will make its report at a public forum tonight,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The panel of parents, teachers and officials of the city and
Capistrano Unified School District has worked for about two years to
address concerns that the 30-year-old school lacks technology such as
adequate connections for computer networks.</LD>
<LD>   Among the options the task force considered was a San Clemente
offer to swap the current school site on Avenida Pico for land about
five miles away on Avenida La Pata.</LD>
<TE>   The existing site would be used for a fire station or other city
facilities.</TE>

<HD>Squirrels Do Their Part in Educating America's Youths on
College Campuses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fur is flying over the Web site Campus Squirrel Listings,
specifically the allegation that UCLA has few "squirrel-friendly
trees" and that some of its resident creatures "look underfed and
mangy." (I mean the squirrels, not the students.) The Web site
collects reports from schools across the nation about their squirrels
(gottshall.com/squirrels/campsq.htm). And it postulates a correlation
between the quality of higher learning on a campus and the health of
the college's squirrel population.</LD>
<LD>   That there should be varied opinions about UCLA's squirrels is no
surprise, inasmuch as the campus is about the size of a Third World
country.</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, contributor Mark Chen wrote to say that far from being
weak, the squirrels he's seen at UCLA have become aggressive from
"continuous close contact with humans.... [The] squirrels will
actually steal our Taco Bell when we're not looking. After a rather
harrowing experience, we learned to never ever again place our tacos
on the ground."</LD>
<TE>   Well, college is a place to learn.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of fur ... : Lindsay Conner of L.A. found a store in
Westwood that caters to animals with big horns (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Talk about urban sprawl: Rona Visser found a section of what
appeared to be the City of Angels bordering the Canadian province of
New Brunswick. But there's no secession movement afoot. Someone had
actually removed a couple of letters from a sign in the town of Alma.</TE>
<TE>   Pardon this interruption: Steve Thompson of La Crescenta told the
Web site laradio.com about a trip to Seattle, where he heard a
station with a "Quick 96" format, which "played seven-second-long
snippets from about a thousand different songs....</TE>
<TE>   "Their slogan was 'The best parts of your favorite songs.' " It
was a gimmick, of course, a transition period, while the station
switched owners and formats.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson recalled the time KFAC-FM (92.3) became KKBT in 1989. In
the interim, the station broadcast the sound of a heart beating for
several hours.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when KSCA-FM (101.9) abandoned a format of news and
contemporary rock, the station played a laugh track for 12 straight
hours before going the Spanish-language route.</TE>
<TE>   Another approach: Sometimes there's no hint when a change at a
radio station is in the offing. Don Barrett's book, "Los Angeles
Radio People," recalled how disc jockey Gene Weed of Top 40 music
KFWB signed off on March 10, 1968: "We'll be right back with more
music after the news."</TE>
<TE>   The music died right there. KFWB immediately went all-news.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The solar eclipse the other day reminded Marie Harvey
(a.k.a. Only in L.A. Moms) about a similar event on the family farm
in Westminster when she was a girl.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden there was no bright sun, only twilight," she
said. "And I guess it confused the animals.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing we could see was our cow, Bossy, down in the
field coming toward the barn. She only went there at night. And the
chickens ran to their coops and hopped in their perches to go to
sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Good thing I was indoors working and didn't notice the latest
eclipse. Otherwise, I might have imitated Bossy in my own way and
strolled across the street to the saloon.</TE>

<HD>Young Woman Drawn to Life as a Missionary, Despite New
Risks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who can say where missionary zeal comes from? Heather Mayo remembers
being in eighth grade and getting a chance to work in the church
nursery. Something about working and playing with the children
ignited a pilot light inside her. The passion from that long-ago
flame still burns.</LD>
<LD>   She's 22 now and has set her sights on the world. Not the world of
Costa Mesa where she grew up and still lives, but places like
Africa--which suffers from its own world of hurt.</LD>
<LD>   Mayo wants to be a missionary. It's not a career that should bring
the fear of death and kidnapping, but all you have to do is keep up
with the news to see that it does.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Kansas missionary Martin Burnham was killed in the
Philippines when army forces raided the hide-out of the rebels who
had kidnapped him and his wife, Gracia, also a missionary, a year
ago. In the shootout, another hostage--a Filipino nurse named Deborah
Yap--also died.</TE>
<TE>   Mayo knows about the Philippines saga, and it's not as though she
blithely dismisses the possibility that the life she wants might
bring similar risks.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started thinking about [a missionary life], I
actually had nightmares about kidnappings and other things," she
says. "I was in college, I'd be asleep and I'd wake up. One that kept
repeating was that I'd be working in an orphanage, and we'd have to
flee the area and bring the children with us because another faction
... wanted us killed or captured. One of my great fears is bringing
children to know God only to have them be killed or persecuted for
that."</TE>
<TE>   Mayo isn't telling the story with any trace of gruesomeness or
gloom. To the contrary, as we talk at the Harbor Trinity preschool in
Costa Mesa where she works, she's the picture of good humor and
buoyancy.</TE>
<TE>   I was curious whether the violent end to the standoff in the
Philippines, where an extremist Islamic group known as Abu Sayyaf has
kidnapped a number of people over the years, had any effect on her
career plans.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is no. She hasn't decided if her missionary career,
when it begins after another 18 months of college, will be U.S.-based
or largely abroad. But she thinks she knows.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart is Africa," she says. "There are just so many kids being
orphaned and being left because of AIDS and wars, and they're going
to be the culture's leaders. Who's leading them? The adults are
dying. I want to go in and help them."</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't see herself as daring, or someone in search of
excitement. "I'm far from an adventurer," she says. "Life is an
adventure, I guess. You can't avoid it. There are lots of problems
out there, and I'd like to help. Sometimes, it takes a little extra
work."</TE>
<TE>   Still, why not the safe life? Why not missionary work in America
from behind a desk?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what it is," she says, and it's obvious she has
grappled with the question before. "I could be happily married, have
the picket fence, the tire swing in the yard and just have a
fulfilled life. I don't know that I'd be bored, but I know there's a
need out there that I have a passion for, and that passion or desire
is greater than my desire for a safe, perfect home in Costa Mesa."</TE>
<TE>   Mayo has made short missionary-related excursions to Romania,
Mexico and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal, she says, "is the global community worshipping under
God. To me, it's God's kingdom seen in every kind of earthly kingdom,
if that makes sense."</TE>
<TE>   Her sense of danger is real enough that she's walked herself
through the what-if scenarios. "Say it does happen, that children I
bring to Christ do get persecuted or tortured," she says. "Is it
worth it to them? Is it worth it to the kingdom?"</TE>
<TE>   Those are not insignificant questions, but she quickly says that
the fear isn't paralyzing. "The possibility of danger is always
there," she says. "But if God is calling me out to the field, I'm not
going to let that fear stop me."</TE>
<TE>   She laughs again about being miscast as an adventuress or fearless
globe-trotter. Her parents, she says, would "love it if I'd stay
home." But they understand.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom just wishes it weren't Africa," she says. "She's spent a
lot of time trying to convince me there's a huge need for children's
workers in Ireland."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Donald Fredrickson, 77, former director of the National
Institutes of Health who helped connect lipids and fats to heart
disease, was found dead Friday, floating in the pool of his home in
Bethesda, Md. Authorities said he drowned after suffering a heart
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Canon City, Colo., he served in the Army reserves during
World War II. He studied engineering at the University of Colorado
and earned his medical degree from the University of Michigan.</LD>
<LD>   Fredrickson spent more than two decades at the institutes, working
with others in 1965 to classify a group of fatty substances called
lipids by studying how they bind to proteins in the blood. That
system is now the worldwide standard.</LD>
<TE>   He also discovered two genetic disorders: tangier disease, which
results from the absence of high-density lipoprotein; and cholesterol
ester storage disease, caused by a deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor served as director of the NIH from 1975 until 1981. In
1984, he became the first full-time president of the Howard Hughes
Medical Research Institute in Bethesda. He was forced to resign three
years later in a squabble over financial irregularities.</TE>

<HD>Words of Welcome for State Poet</HD>
<DH>Arts: Quincy T. Troupe of La Jolla, whose verse has won
major awards, is sworn in as laureate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Capitol was absorbed as usual Tuesday with the grueling work of
passing a state budget. But in a conference room just off the
governor's office, the talk was of poetry--its beauty, its potential,
its relevance in our modern, materialistic world.</LD>
<LD>   The man doing the talking was Quincy T. Troupe, California's first
formally selected poet laureate. After a panel of literary experts
thinned the group of 50 contenders to three, Gov. Gray Davis decided
that Troupe was the bard for the job.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Troupe took the oath of office and recited two poems
in his clear, rousing voice. Then the writer from La Jolla held forth
on his plans as the official state ambassador for his craft.</LD>
<TE>   "Poetry is a very powerful and beautiful and necessary and ancient
art," he told reporters and admiring literati. "I'd like to see
poetry everyplace. I know that's a big order."</TE>
<TE>   Charismatic with a broad smile, Troupe, 62, teaches creative
writing and American and Caribbean literature at UC San Diego. He has
published 13 books, including six volumes of poetry, and collaborated
with Miles Davis on Davis' autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   Those familiar with his work describe it as accessible and
powerful, calling his readings--sometimes accompanied by
music--electric. Favoring free verse over more formalistic poetry, he
has won two American Book Awards and the Peabody Award and has twice
received the heavyweight title at the Taos Poetry Circus.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a freight train on the loose," said Francisco Dominguez, a
Sacramento writer. "It's free-flowing verse, not real academic. He
turns into the poem. He's it."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Montoya, the poet laureate for the city of Sacramento, said
Troupe's talents make him an excellent fit for the job: "Poets don't
usually make good teachers. But he doesn't leave an audience without
having left a lesson."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in St. Louis, Troupe became acquainted with poetry during
boyhood, when his mother would read him verse on Saturdays as the
other kids played outside.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated her for it," he said. But now, he added, "I thank her all
the time" for planting the seed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, Troupe rediscovered poetry while recovering from a
basketball injury in France. He began carrying a notebook and writing
verse, while "reading everybody I could put my hands on."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he settled on Chilean great Pablo Neruda as the poet
"closest to me as an influence. I had to write through him to get to
my own voice."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to describe his writing style, Troupe called himself
disciplined and focused: "Sometimes it doesn't come, and sometimes it
does come and it's terrible. But sometimes it's glorious. And you
live for those moments."</TE>
<TE>   In introducing Troupe on Tuesday, Sharon Davis, wife of the
governor, said Davis chose him because he is both a "gifted poet" and
accomplished educator.</TE>
<TE>   Troupe said he loves to visit schools and share poetry with
children and would raise money from Hollywood, corporations and other
sources to expand on that work as laureate.</TE>
<TE>   But children, he said, aren't the only ones who need poetry.
Troupe would like to bring the power of the written word into the
workplace, community centers, churches--even the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "Poetry balances the life," he said, "and that is crucial, to
learn to balance whatever you're doing with the arts.... You don't
appreciate sometimes how art can influence you until you're in it."</TE>
<TE>   As poet laureate, Troupe will receive a small stipend and serve a
two-year term. During his tenure, he must present at least six public
readings and undertake some sort of poetry initiative.</TE>
<TE>   California has been served periodically by poets laureate since
1915, but their selection has been informal and had more to do with
politics than a knack for iambic pentameter. The last one--Charles B.
"Gus" Garrigus, a former assemblyman chosen by fellow
legislators--had the job from 1966 until his death in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Davis signed a bill that formalized the duties and
selection process.</TE>

<HD>Governor Now Backs Private Female Prison</HD>
<DH>Budget: After women legislators urge that the facility
remain open, Davis changes his mind about one of five sites he had
proposed closing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis, facing pressure from several lawmakers, reversed
himself partially and agreed to permit one of five private prisons to
continue operating, administration officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In his initial budget proposal in January, Davis recommended
closing five private prisons in what he said was a money-saving move,
a move that cheered a major benefactor, the California Correctional
Peace Officers Assn. On Tuesday, administration officials said during
a legislative budget hearing that they were willing to permit one of
the private prisons, which houses women, to remain open.</LD>
<LD>   At least two dozen women legislators signed a letter last month
urging that Davis keep open the Leo Chesney Correctional Facility at
Live Oak, north of Sacramento. The other four facilities house men.
Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean cited the legislative support for the
Live Oak prison as one reason the governor shifted positions. She
also noted that the state has no other minimum-security prison for
women.</LD>
<TE>   "This Live Oak facility is the only one that houses
minimum-security female inmates," McLean said. The Live Oak prison
has a capacity of 195 inmates, classified as low security risks and
nearing the end of their sentences. Since January, the California
Department of Corrections has stopped sending inmates there, leaving
it with fewer than 100 women.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' reversal is not the final word. By late Tuesday, the joint
Senate-Assembly budget conference committee had not agreed to restore
money for the prison. Without the committee's approval, the facility
still could close at the end of the month when its contract expires.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Brown, lobbyist for the prison officers' union, said the
issue is "still up in the air."</TE>
<TE>   Also in doubt is whether the contractor, Cornell Co. of Houston,
would continue operating the facility, or whether the contract would
be put up for competitive bidding.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Green, assistant secretary of the California Youth and Adult
Correctional Agency, noted that the state itself could decide to
operate the facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We're better off today than we were yesterday, and it's good
news," said Marvin Wiebe of Cornell. "But it is hardly over. While we
applaud the governor, we're not sure the guards' union is going to
allow him to do it. We don't know whether he has the votes, or the
guards' union has the votes."</TE>
<TE>   The prison officers' union long has opposed private prisons, in
part because the union does not represent guards at the privately
owned facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone recording earlier this year intended for union
members, a longtime lobbyist for the Correctional Peace Officers
lauded Davis' original proposal to close all five prisons, saying it
"does follow through with promises made by Gov. Davis in past years."</TE>
<TE>   "As many of our members are aware, the whole concept of
privatization has been a thorn in our side," the message said. "That
move is appreciated."</TE>
<TE>   The union spent more than $2 million directly and indirectly to
help elect Davis in 1998, and it donated $251,000 earlier this year
after Davis proposed eliminating the private prisons and after the
administration approved a labor pact with the union granting guards
what could be a 34% pay hike over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   The administration, trying to close a $24-billion budget deficit,
had contended that closing the five private prisons would save the
state $2.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the state Department of Finance estimated that keeping
the Live Oak prison open would cost $598,000.</TE>
<TE>   In their letter, the women lawmakers lauded the Live Oak prison,
saying it "offers women an excellent chance to rebuild their lives
and rejoin society."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Harding, the Corrections Department official who oversees
private prisons, said in a letter last August that in a two-year
period, there were only two drug-related offenses at the Live Oak
prison, and noted: " ... The facility is a clean, orderly,
well-managed facility with excellent leadership."</TE>

<HD>Bill Aims to Ensure That Felons Don't Profit by Selling
Stories</HD>
<DH>Crime: A Senate panel OKs proposal to extend statute of
limitations for lawsuits by victims and family members over book,
movie deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Senate Judiciary Committee, heeding the appeals of crime victims,
took the first step Tuesday toward restoring a state law prohibiting
convicted murderers and other violent felons from profiting from the
sales of books, movies and memorabilia at the expense of their
victims.</LD>
<LD>   The committee unanimously approved a bill by state Sen. Bruce
McPherson (R-Santa Cruz) that would allow victims to sue their
attackers in civil court for damages long after the felons had
completed parole and were free citizens again.</LD>
<LD>   "Perpetrators of heinous crimes should not profit from them,"
testified McPherson, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor,
whose own son was murdered on a San Francisco street.</LD>
<TE>   A handful of crime victims pleaded with the committee to approve
the bill, including Carole Carrington, whose daughter and
granddaughter along with a schoolgirl from Argentina were savagely
murdered during a vacation at Yosemite in 1999, allegedly by handyman
Cary Stayner.</TE>
<TE>   "It just horrifies me to think of him being paid for telling how
he slit my granddaughter's throat," Carrington told the committee as
her voice broke with emotion.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would fill the gap created in California's "Son of Sam"
law earlier this year when the state Supreme Court struck down a core
provision of the statute, ruling that it violated the 1st Amendment
right to free speech. The court said the law unconstitutionally
zeroed in on a felon's books, movies, articles and other protected
"expressive" works only because they made mention of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   But the court, whose ruling was expected to be repeated in other
states, said it believed that the Legislature could create a law to
prevent criminals from profiting at the expense of their victims and
still meet constitutional muster.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson's bill, SB 1887, steers clear of free-speech issues.
Instead, it would give crime victims many additional years to file
civil lawsuits when a prisoner or a freed felon attempts to turn his
or her crime into a money-maker, such as authorizing personal stories
for television movies or creating a cookbook, as Sara Jane Olson,
accused of murder as a Symbionese Liberation Army member, has done
with her "America's Most Wanted" recipe book.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would extend the statute of limitations for filing a
damage suit from one year after conviction to 10 years after the
perpetrator is released from parole. All of a defendant's assets
would be exposed, including such things as an inheritance or lottery
winnings.</TE>
<TE>   Backers said that subjecting them to civil damages not only while
they were behind bars but long after they had been returned to
society would have a deterrent effect on entrepreneurial felons.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of such suits would be borne by the plaintiffs without
aid from district attorneys or the attorney general. But state Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer, who sought the legislation, said victories should
be relatively easy to win because the hardest work--gaining a
criminal conviction--would already have been done by prosecutors and
the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Lobaco of the American Civil Liberties Union, who
opposes the bill, estimated that the extended statute of limitations
would lurk over the felon for 20 to 25 years after he or she had
completed a prison term and parole.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would apply to 16 violent crimes, including murder, rape,
kidnapping, mayhem and a variety of sex offenses. It would not apply
to people convicted of inflicting great bodily harm, such as drunk
drivers who injure someone.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was sent to the full Senate. If, as expected, it is
approved by both houses and signed by Gov. Gray Davis, it would take
effect immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Californians have long opposed the notion of felons profiting from
their crimes. Particularly galling to crime-victim advocates is the
income that Charles Manson has acquired while behind bars by
marketing dolls and other items through outside supporters on the
Internet. "Manson makes well over $100,000 a year," testified Nina
Salarno of Crime Victims United.</TE>

<HD>Molestation Suspect Now Wants a Trial by Jury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just moments before a Ventura County judge was to rule on his guilt
or innocence Tuesday, county school trustee Albert Rosen halted court
proceedings and requested that a jury decide the child molestation
charges pending against him.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Rosen has had second thoughts," said Oxnard attorney Joseph
O'Neill, who told reporters his client was confused when he waived
his trial rights last week.</LD>
<LD>   Rosen, 75, a retired teacher and longtime member of the Ventura
County Board of Education, is accused of molesting a 6-year-old girl
at his Simi Valley residence more than 30 years ago. He is charged
with 10 counts of lewd conduct with a child younger than 14 and faces
a possible life prison sentence if convicted.</LD>
<TE>   A week ago, Rosen agreed to forgo a jury trial and submitted the
case to Superior Court Judge Charles McGrath, who told Rosen that he
would most likely be found guilty based on transcripts from a
preliminary hearing last fall. Rosen ignored the warning and asked
McGrath to make a ruling.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday morning, just before McGrath was to announce his
decision, Rosen indicated through his attorney that he wanted to
withdraw the waiver and let a jury hear the case. A hearing is set
for July 3.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, O'Neill said his client did not understand
what he was doing last week and has a right to ask the court to
withdraw the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   But Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ernesto Acosta said Rosen did not
appear confused at the time. Acosta said that Rosen consulted with
his lawyer and answered "yes" when asked by the prosecutor whether he
understood the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea where he is going with this," Acosta said. "My
suspicion is that the defendant is concerned about losing his
position with the Board of Education."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen, who is free on $50,000 bail, remains a member of the county
board, which oversees the superintendent of schools office and runs
special-education programs, continuation schools and classes for
incarcerated juveniles. His term expires at the end of the year, and
Rosen has indicated he will not seek reelection. He was charged with
child molestation last year after a woman came forward with
allegations that he had sexually assaulted her between 1966 and 1970.
The defense has twice challenged the constitutionality of a state law
that permits prosecutors to charge Rosen with sex crimes decades
after the six-year statute of limitations has expired.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill contends the law is unfair and unconstitutional and has
left his client in a difficult position, because after so many years
there are no witnesses or evidence to contradict the woman's claims.
But those objections were overruled because the law has been upheld
by the California Supreme Court.</TE>

in late 1989, to step down sooner. Under state law, elected officials
cannot be removed from office without a recall election unless they
are convicted of a felony or of a crime connected with the duties of
their office.</TE>

Rosen with sex crimes decades after the six-year statute of
limitations has expired.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill contends the law is unfair and unconstitutional and has
left his client in a difficult position, because after so many years
there are no witnesses or evidence to contradict the woman's claims.</TE>
<TE>   But those objections were overruled because the law has been
upheld by the California Supreme Court.</TE>

<LD>A Sonoma County judge has turned down a state request to delay an
order freeing a convicted killer after 18 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Superior Court Judge Elliot Lee Daum ordered Raymond
Skinner, 68, released from prison. Skinner was convicted of killing
his wife in 1983.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer asked Daum on Monday to delay his order so
it could be appealed.</LD>

Gray Davis exceeded his authority in blocking an inmate's parole.
Each case is on appeal.</TE>

<HD>Bullet Missed Child's Vital Organs</HD>
<DH>Shooting: Lake Forest toddler who survived father's rampage
was in critical condition but alert and talking, said doctors. Her
mother and cousin were killed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN and DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lake Forest toddler shot in the chest by her father survived
because the bullet miraculously missed all vital organs, police and
medical experts said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "She's very, very lucky," spokesman Jim Amormino of the Orange
County Sheriff's Department said of the 22-month-old girl. "The
bullet went straight through like a laser."</LD>
<LD>   Alycia Aquities Renae Turner remained in critical condition
Tuesday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo,
but officials said the child was alert and talking. Orange County
social services personnel will be responsible for her care until
guardianship is determined in court, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Alycia was the only survivor of Monday's incident, in which her
father, Thomas Lewis Turner, fatally shot his wife, his teenage
nephew and himself.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the toddler was shot at close range with a
.357-caliber pistol but was not hit in the heart or lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Demetrios Demetriades, director of trauma services in surgical
intensive care at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, said the
bullet "most likely hit the periphery of the lung, which is not a
lethal situation. It essentially causes bleeding or leaking of air in
the chest cavity but doesn't do any serious damage."</TE>
<TE>   If a person is shot in the heart with a low-velocity bullet like
those associated with handguns, he said, the survival rate is only 7%
to 10%. But when the bullet misses the heart and major blood vessels,
the survival rate jumps to better than 90%, he said. Barring such
complications as infections, a victim can recover in as little as two
or three days, Demetriades said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just pure luck," he said of the toddler's injury, "but it
explains the good outcome."</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy completed Tuesday showed that the child's mother,
39-year-old Acedra Renee Turner, was shot once in the head. The
girl's cousin Broderick Turner, 15, was shot twice in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Monday's shootings at the family's two-bedroom home at
Cedar Glen Apartments appeared to have been carefully planned. Thomas
Turner, 40, shot his wife in their bedroom as she prepared for work.
He then walked to his nephew's bedroom and shot the teen. He returned
to the bedroom and shot his daughter, who was lying in her crib, then
shot himself in the chest, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, a credit union manager and devout churchgoer, may have
been distraught over marital problems, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   At El Toro High School, where Broderick Turner was a popular
freshman football player, Principal Jack Clement announced the
tragedy on the public-address system before classes began Tuesday.
"One of our classmates and a member of our family just left us in a
tragic situation," he said. "Let's take a moment and reflect on his
life and what he meant to us."</TE>
<TE>   Later he said, "We're all trying to absorb this. We're not used to
seeing his desk empty. We're going to miss him."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Broderick's classmates had already heard the news. In his
fourth-period Spanish class, white roses lay on the wooden desk where
he sat.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff West, a freshman who was on the football team with Broderick
and sat next to him English class, said: "He didn't try to be cool.
He didn't try to be nice. He wasn't trying to be somebody else. He
was Broderick, and everyone liked him for that."</TE>
<TE>   The teen, who was called "Bro" and "Brod," worked hard to stay in
shape, his classmate said, lifting weights even off-season.</TE>
<TE>   On the campus, students hung yellow banners expressing their
thoughts. One read: "Man, even though I didn't like to admit it, you
were the best wide receiver. I will love you forever."</TE>
<TE>   Another said: "You had such a good attitude and always had a
smile. Just isn't fair."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man suspected of fatally shooting his ex-wife outside her Altadena
home and injuring a neighbor turned himself in to authorities late
Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Brett Williams, 41, who shared custody of his two children, had
brought them to his former wife's apartment about 8 p.m. Monday, and
the parents began to argue, said Sheriff's Lt. Ray Peavy.</LD>
<LD>   When Williams allegedly began to beat Joanna Williams, 42, the
children fled to the street and she followed, Peavy said.</LD>
<TE>   Williams allegedly "chased her through the complex and shot her,"
Peavy said. She was hit at least once in the upper body. The children
were unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   When a neighbor, Catherine Beck, 51, entered the courtyard of the
apartment complex in the 800 block of East Mendocino Street, Williams
allegedly shot her and fled, Peavy said.</TE>
<TE>   Joanna Williams died at a nearby hospital. Beck was treated and
released.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Brett Williams surrendered to Pasadena police,
apparently at the urging of his father. He was transferred to the
Sheriff's Department's custody and booked into Central Jail on
suspicion of murder and attempted murder.</TE>

<LD>Federal agents have arrested four people, including a senior
Immigration and Naturalization Service inspector at Los Angeles
International Airport, on charges of smuggling illegal immigrants
from the Philippines into the United States through LAX, authorities
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged scheme exploited loopholes in the INS' Transit Without
Visa Program, in which arriving international passengers en route to
a third country can stop briefly in the United States while
connecting to other flights. The program has come under scrutiny
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks focused attention on the
weaknesses of controls at U.S. airports, borders and seaports.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities cited no known link to terrorism in the LAX
case--merely a highly profitable scheme in which people with no legal
way to enter the U.S. paid up to $10,000 apiece.</LD>
<TE>   INS officials initially considered shutting down the Transit
Without Visa Program after the Sept. 11 attacks, but are now
considering less drastic changes, such as limiting the number of
airports using it and expanding the list of countries whose nationals
are barred from no-visa transit travel.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 million foreigners lacking U.S. visas pass through the
country each year as transit passengers en route to other nations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a program that needs to be looked at because there are
loopholes in it," said Andrew Cowan, an assistant U.S. attorney who
is handling the case against Maximiano R. Ramos, 52, a 19-year INS
veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos and two alleged confederates, Eshraga E. Nugud, 41, and
Gloria E. Acosta, 47, both employees of a private security firm at
LAX, appeared Tuesday before a U.S. magistrate in Los Angeles. Ramos
and Acosta were ordered held without bail, while Nugud's bond was set
at $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth suspect, Vinzon S. Perez, 57, is expected to appear in
court today. A fifth suspect, Rita A. Cunanan, 42--described by
authorities as Ramos' girlfriend and a former employee of a firm that
helps handle ground arrangements at LAX for Philippine
Airlines--remained at large, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on federal smuggling charges, the defendants could
each face up to five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Ramos and his girlfriend helped
coordinate the scheme through contacts in the Philippines. Ramos, a
retired U.S. Marine, is a naturalized U.S. citizen from the
Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say those to be smuggled would fly from the
Philippines to LAX, making sure to arrive while Ramos was on duty.
Nugud and Acosta, employees of Aviation Safeguards, allegedly would
meet the passengers at their arriving flight gate and escort them
past security and out of the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, court papers allege, Perez and an accomplice would
pick up the passengers and drive them to an apartment or "safe house"
in Panorama City. They would remain there for several days until they
were ready to leave for their final destinations in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, the federal complaint alleges, Ramos, various
confederates and several smuggled passengers who had arrived on the
evening of Dec. 24, 2000, all had a Christmas Eve dinner together
after leaving LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos was put on paid administrative leave pending resolution of
the criminal matter, an INS spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Transit Without Visa Program was launched after World War II
to help resettle refugees, many of whom lacked identity and travel
documents. INS officials have argued that the program is obsolete and
represents a security risk, but the airline industry has fought
fiercely to maintain what is regarded as an important marketing tool.</TE>
<TE>   The program allows carriers to route many of their most lucrative
customers through LAX and other hubs in the United States, while
offering fliers a means to avoid the inconvenience of obtaining
visas, including time-consuming State Department background checks.</TE>
<TE>   A central weakness of the program is that it relies largely on the
airlines to police themselves and ensure that transit passengers
actually leave the country. Typically, the airlines hire private
security firms to "escort" transit passengers, but authorities fear
the lure of graft from smuggling proceeds is too great a temptation
for security guards and even INS officials.</TE>
<TE>   The INS cannot easily verify that all transit passengers depart
the country. Inspectors at airports do not confirm each departure at
the time of boarding, but instead rely on an archaic paperwork system
that takes weeks to enter into INS computers.</TE>
<TE>   The four suspects allegedly conspired to meet the passengers at
their arriving flight at LAX, divert them past their connecting
flight and escort them past airport security. The schemers allegedly
received about $10,000 per person smuggled, Cowan said.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal complaint against the five was based on eight
Philippine nationals allegedly smuggled into the country since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Cowan declined to comment on the volume of cases the defendants
may have handled. The FBI also was involved in the case.</TE>

<HD>City Does About-Face on Recall</HD>
<DH>Voting: After months of defiance, South Gate will seek
county oversight of its special elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after Secretary of State Bill Jones announced legislation
that would force South Gate to relinquish control of recall elections
for two years, the City Council voted Monday night to consider
letting the county take over the process.</LD>
<LD>   The move represents a reversal for the ruling council majority,
which for three months has defied Jones' order to cede control.</LD>
<LD>   Jones accuses members of the majority of manipulating the
electoral process to block a recall drive targeting them. City
leaders deny the charges and flew to Sacramento on Tuesday to argue
that the bill would set a bad precedent in denying the rights of
local governments.</LD>
<TE>   "Think about it: You are contemplating doing something that is
contrary to democratic principles favoring local control," said Mayor
Xochilt Ruvalcaba, according to a transcript of the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba told lawmakers that the Jones legislation is a "moot
point" because the city now intends to allow county oversight of
recall elections.</TE>
<TE>   But critics call the abrupt about-face a cynical ploy to foil the
pending bill. Many suspect the council will back out of any deal to
give up control of recall elections if the legislation is dropped.</TE>
<TE>   The council's change of heart "sounds too good to be true," recall
supporter Pascual Cervera told the council. "I think you have
something up your sleeve ... but I can't pinpoint it."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the secretary of state said Jones plans to proceed
with the legislation, which passed its first test Tuesday, when it
was unanimously approved by an Assembly committee.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which would require South Gate to give the Los Angeles
County registrar-recorder's office control of recall elections for
two years, now goes to the Assembly floor.</TE>
<TE>   Council opponents say they have gathered enough signatures to get
a recall election on the ballot but must first win a court battle
with the city. Recall organizers accuse members of the council
majority and the city treasurer of corruption, a charge those
officials deny.</TE>
<TE>   The recall battle is developing against a backdrop of escalating
tensions in this crisis-racked city. Monday's council meeting
degenerated into the usual catcalls and insults aimed at leaders.
"Bye, crooks," yelled one man after being kicked out by Ruvalcaba.</TE>
<TE>   The council also took heat over revelations that the city's trial
specialist, Cristeta Paguirigan, is a disbarred attorney and
convicted embezzler. Despite that criticism, the council authorized
more work for her law firm, asking it to negotiate an agreement with
county officials on the election takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Treasurer Albert Robles said Paguirigan deserves a second chance.
"I believe in the power of forgiveness, redemption and reformation,"
he said. "I think we have to give people an opportunity to change
their lives."</TE>
<TE>   But others pointed out that Paguirigan pleaded guilty to
embezzlement charges as recently as April, and she faces a three-year
prison term if she doesn't repay several victims by October.</TE>
<TE>   "A city should not be dealing with a firm that hires a convicted
felon to work in the city," said Bill De Witt, a former councilman.</TE>
<TE>   While De Witt stayed within the three-minute limit for speeches,
those who didn't were tossed out by Ruvalcaba, who has recently
tightened her enforcement of the rules of public decorum.</TE>
<TE>   Elected and appointed officials are not spared.</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba cut off Deputy Police Chief Tommy Tunson in mid-sentence
while he was protesting an unusual move forcing all officers,
including police brass, to wear uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   She pulled the microphone plug--literally--on City Clerk Carmen
Avalos, who protested being shortchanged on her speaking time.</TE>
<TE>   City officials claim the rules are necessary to maintain order.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets Prison for Religious Hate Crimes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A self-styled Muslim fundamentalist from Egypt was sentenced Tuesday
to nearly five years in state prison for attacking religious statues
at a Culver City Catholic church and school in October and stealing
hundreds of Muslim magazines from a mosque in South Los Angeles that
he left at the church.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles resident Emad Ibrahim Saad, 35, had fired several
attorneys and insisted on representing himself at his trial until the
last day, when he refused to emerge from lockup and go to court.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Robert P. O'Neill then named attorney Louis
Sepe to represent him for the closing of the trial. Sepe could not be
reached after the verdict. The defendant, unable to make bail, has
been held since his arrest and will get credit for time served.</LD>
<TE>   According to testimony, Saad decapitated the Virgin Mary statue at
St. Augustine's Church and school on Oct. 28. He also cut a hand off
a statue of St. Rita and carted a statue of Father Junipero Serra,
which he cut off at the feet, a mile away to a mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders of the King Fahd mosque in Culver City immediately
notified police and apologized to the church, saying Saad's acts were
an attempt to cause a rift between the two houses of worship.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony also was heard that Saad earlier stole up to 2,000
copies of a Muslim magazine from the Masjid as-Salaam mosque in South
Los Angeles, strewing them about at St. Augustine's and other
churches.</TE>
<TE>   Hate crime prosecutor Erwin Petilos of the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office said about $15,000 damage was done at St.
Augustine's. The Junipero Serra statue has been replaced by the
William Hannon Foundation, and a new Virgin Mary statue, paid for by
contributions by students and others, is on order, said Norman Mazey,
the school's principal.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill sentenced Saad to two years in prison for damaging the
statues, two years for the hate crime that was involved in that act
and eight months for stealing the Muslim magazines.</TE>

<HD>County May Sue to Get Flood Money</HD>
<DH>Revenue: Supervisor Silva suggests a lawsuit to recover $90
million in matching funds owed by the state and to avoid tapping
O.C.'s reserves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Orange County facing a $57-million budget deficit, Supervisor
Jim Silva on Tuesday proposed suing the state to recover more than
$90 million in flood project money owed the county.</LD>
<LD>   Silva directed county counsel to explore taking legal action to
help balance the proposed $4.9-billion budget for 2002-03 and hold
off from tapping into the county's "strategic priorities reserves."</LD>
<LD>   The discussion came during a budget presentation by county finance
officials, who proposed using $17 million in reserves because of a
grim economic picture stemming from the stagnant economy and the
state's $23.6-billion deficit.</LD>
<TE>   The budget shortfall could force the county to reduce or end
programs in mental health, probation and other areas.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm hearing is that we're going to use $17 million and that
it could cost us more next year," Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to seek litigation to try and recover the $90 million in
flood money that the state owes the county."</TE>
<TE>   Such a lawsuit would be rare, if not unprecedented, said the
county counsel's office and a Sacramento association representing the
state's 58 counties.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the issue is the fact that Orange County is owed the
most by the state for flood-control projects, said Karen Keene, a
spokeswoman for the California State Assn. of Counties.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer also asked county officials to investigate
whether other counties owed money would consider joining the lawsuit
and help share litigation costs.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, legal costs could be prohibitive, Spitzer said. He
suggested pooling resources and perhaps investigating whether a
consortium among counties could be formed.</TE>
<TE>   Silva, whose district includes Newport Beach and other coastal
cities that have benefited from flood-control projects, has been
displeased with the state's inaction for years.</TE>
<TE>   The money owed is the state's matching funds for such federal
flood-control projects as the Santa Ana River reconstruction and
Prado Dam improvements, a Silva aide said.</TE>
<TE>   The funds have only trickled in. But now with the county facing
major program cuts and potential layoffs, Silva said he at least
wants to explore the county's legal options.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which
coordinates flood-control matching funds, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Tuesday, supervisors gave preliminary approval to
spend $4.6 million from the county's general fund to help cover a
$10.6-million shortfall in the district attorney's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas told supervisors that he had been
counting on receiving an increase in sales tax revenue to fully fund
his department's budget; instead, that revenue dropped by 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas had sought the full $10.6 million from the county's
general fund. But after County Executive Officer Michael Schumacher
worked with Rackauckas to find other cost-saving measures, the county
agreed to pay the reduced amount of $4.6 million.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council has officially qualified the petition signatures
needed to place an initiative on the November ballot that would allow
for further development of the city's hillsides.</LD>
<LD>   By random sampling, the city clerk's office projected that 11,499
of the 15,662 petition signatures submitted by supporters of the Open
80 campaign are valid. Proponents of the measure needed to collect
the signatures of 8,906 local registered voters.</LD>
<LD>   Backers of the initiative want to build as many as 1,390 homes on
the city's hillsides, while dedicating about 3,000 acres as open
space.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents argue that developers are skirting the usual
environmental review process by placing the measure on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   At its July 1 meeting, the City Council will hear the city
attorney's summary and analysis of the Open 80 plan. At that time,
officials are expected to adopt a resolution to place the initiative
on the fall ballot.</TE>

<HD>Mamo Wolde; Won Olympic Gold, Bronze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mamo Wolde, an Ethiopian distance runner who won medals in two
Olympics, including a gold in the marathon in the 1968 Mexico City
Games, but spent much of the last decade of his life in prison, has
died. He was believed to be 70 or 71.</LD>
<LD>   Afflicted with bronchial and liver problems, Wolde died May 26 at
his home in Addis Ababa.</LD>
<LD>   Wolde's rise to world prominence and fall from grace occurred
against the backdrop of the political turmoil and civil war that has
been a part of the Ethiopian fabric since the ouster of Emperor Haile
Selassie in 1974.</LD>
<TE>   A member of Selassie's palace guard, Wolde survived the emperor's
overthrow and the imposition of a harsh Marxist regime.</TE>
<TE>   Wolde's troubles began after years of civil war in which tens of
thousands of Ethiopians were killed, and the 1991 exile of the
country's strongman, Mengistu Haile Mariam. Wolde, who apparently was
a member of a local council called the kebele, was detained in 1993
with hundreds of others and held without specific charges by the new
ruling party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.</TE>
<TE>   Despite monitoring of his case by the International Olympic
Committee and Amnesty International, he languished in one of Addis
Ababa's worst prisons for three years. In 1996, he was finally
charged with a crime: shooting and killing a 15-year-old boy, which
he vehemently denied. After legal proceedings that lasted five years,
he was convicted of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The last decade of his life was a far cry from the prominence he
had found as a member of the elite group of long-distance runners
that brought worldwide attention to Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Born Degaga Wolde in a village about 40 miles south of Addis
Ababa, Wolde was orphaned at an early age after the death of his
father, a farmer, and then his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Raised by his godfather until he was old enough to join the army,
Wolde became a member of Selassie's elite palace guard. Membership in
the guard allowed him access to a better education and opportunities
to compete in athletic events.</TE>
<TE>   It was there that he met the legendary Abebe Bikila, Ethiopia's
first Olympic medalist who won the marathon at the 1960 and 1964
games. The two men trained together and became friends.</TE>
<TE>   Wolde's first Olympic experience came in the 1956 Games in
Melbourne when he competed in the 800 and 1,500 meters, finishing
last in both qualifying heats.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Olympic competition in 1964 in Tokyo, running the
10,000 meters and the marathon, but again failed to win a medal.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1968 games, he ran a sensational 1,500-meter race, losing
to Naftail Temu, the first Kenyan to win a gold medal, by 4 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Wolde and Bikila were entered in the marathon. Bikila
dropped out of the race with a leg injury just after the halfway
point and Wolde took control of the pace in Mexico City's high
altitude and never looked back. He finished a full three minutes
ahead of his nearest rival. He was so far ahead of the field that he
completed a victory lap of the stadium before the silver medalist,
Kenji Kimihara of Japan, crossed the finish line. Wolde's time was 2
hours, 20 minutes and 26.4 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   He was treated as a national hero upon his return to Ethiopia.
Songs were written in his honor and he received a promotion to the
rank of captain in Selassie's guards.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later at the age of 40, he would surpass his Mexico
City performance with his fastest marathon time ever--2 hours, 15
minutes and 8 seconds. However, the rest of the world had caught up
with him; Wolde finished third in a race won by Frank Shorter of the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1972 Games, Wolde retired from competition to take up
coaching. But by then Ethiopia was facing famine and a budding revolt
against Selassie's rule. Two years later, the emperor was out,
overthrown by scores of young military officers.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Wolde after the fall of Selassie is unclear. It
appears certain that he served in a kebele, the local councils that
administered parts of Addis Ababa under the Mengistu regime. The
kebeles had wide-ranging powers, which included tax collecting and
settling local disputes. But each kebele also had a Revolutionary
Guard that had more Draconian powers.</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt that human rights abuses were committed under
Mengistu's regime. What is in question is Wolde's role, if any, in
the death of a 15-year-old boy in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   The government, according to a New York Times report, said Wolde
was a high-ranking official of his local kebele and also the head of
the local Revolutionary Guards. As such, the government said, it was
not unusual for Wolde to lead an armed unit that picked up
counter-revolutionaries under orders of the central government.</TE>
<TE>   Wolde denied being a member of the Revolutionary Guards, and said
that in 1978 he was working only as a track coach. Wolde's lawyer
objected to the prosecution's case, noting that no exact date was
presented for the crime. Nor were a weapon or any witnesses produced.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, an Ethiopian court found Wolde guilty in January and
sentenced him to six years in prison. The sentence was retroactive to
the date he was first detained and he was finally released.</TE>
<TE>   He was returned to his wife and three children in failing health.
To the end, he maintained his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Wolde was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery in Addis Ababa beside
Ethiopia's other Olympic champion, Bikila, who died in 1973.</TE>

<HD>Wildfire Near Ojai Is Slowed</HD>
<DH>Firefighting: The 22,000-acre blaze in the Sespe Wilderness
remains 65% contained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strong breezes fanned new hot spots across the Sespe Wilderness on
Tuesday, but the 22,000-acre wildfire in Los Padres National Forest
north of Ojai failed to gain much ground, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been quiet all day," said Jim Renshaw, an engineer with the
Ventura County Fire Department. "There are a few areas that have
acted up because it got drier and hotter again."</LD>
<LD>   Fire crews at Tuesday morning's planning session said two hand
crews cutting fire lines on both sides of the blaze made significant
progress overnight even as the small flare-ups continued to burn.</LD>
<TE>   The fire remains 65% contained, and officials expect to have it
under control by Friday evening. Several helicopters used to fight
the fire were unable to take off Tuesday morning because of dense fog
in Ojai but were airborne by noon, Renshaw said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the blaze, which began June 1, has not been
determined. So far, the fire has cost federal, state and local
agencies $11.9 million. About 1,000 firefighters are still on the
lines. The firefighters' base camp in Ojai's Soule Park will remain
at least through June 21, officials said. The park is temporarily
closed to the public.</TE>

<HD>Yosemite Fire Plan Criticized Over Logging</HD>
<DH>Timber: Activists are upset that the cutting of large trees
would be allowed. Officials say aggressive measures are needed to
prevent blazes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fire protection plan for Yosemite National Park is drawing
criticism from environmentalists who say it would allow the
equivalent of commercial logging in century-old groves of trees long
protected from the lumberjack's ax.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal would allow loggers hired by the park to cut trees up
to 31 1/2 inches in diameter--a size National Park officials concede
is bigger than ever before.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists said that is far too large, noting that in
surrounding national forests, which historically have allowed
commercial logging, the upper limit for eligible trees is 20 inches.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a dangerous precedent," said Jay Watson of the Wilderness
Society. "In the name of reducing fire, the Park Service is
essentially introducing commercial logging in a park. It's curious to
me why they would cross such a bright line."</TE>
<TE>   National Park officials said aggressive efforts are needed to
overcome nearly a century of intensive fire suppression that has
allowed stands of trees in the park--like other spots throughout the
Western United States--to grow too dense, choking meadows and oak
woodlands.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the timber removal would be restricted to about
3,500 to 4,000 acres rimming buildings on the valley floor and other
developed areas, which amounts to about half a percent of the park's
750,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, not every big tree in those areas would be cut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be a bunch of folks going around with blue
spray-paint cans marking every tree in sight," said Tom Nichols, the
National Park Service's regional fire management officer. "It's going
to be very surgical."</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which will be subjected to an exhaustive review in the
coming months and is slated for study in a workshop in the park late
this month, does not spell out what would become of any big trees
felled in the process. The point isn't "to make money or do
clear-cutting or anything else," Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   But he conceded that the fire plan calls for a tactical shift in
the aftermath of a series of catastrophic wildfires that have ravaged
the West in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Yosemite would allow the use of heavy
equipment that can grab mature trees, saw them off at the base and
stack them.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, most of the cutting would occur next to heavily
visited areas such as Yosemite Valley, Wawona and the towns of
Foresta and El Portal.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest change is the size of trees that can be removed.
In the past, the park typically would not cut conifers bigger than a
foot in diameter, relying instead on controlled burns to remove
undergrowth from the forest floor.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols said Yosemite's forest scientists concluded that trees
smaller than 31 1/2 inches grew in an era of aggressive fire
suppression, a well-intended effort that prevented smaller,
containable fires from thinning stands and reducing shrubby growth
that can fuel runaway, catastrophic fires.</TE>
<TE>   Only forests that are next to buildings and campgrounds would be
candidates for logging, Nichols said. Wild areas would be treated
with controlled burns as rangers have for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a euphemism for logging," said Scott Gediman, a
Yosemite spokesman. "It's going in and selectively taking down some
trees. It's certainly not going to look like clear-cuts."</TE>
<TE>   Many environmentalists remain concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Hansen, executive director of the John Muir Project, said the
plan features blanket language that provides no assurances that
logging could not spread to "tens of thousands of acres" throughout
the park, even in unsullied wild lands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clearly to open the door to logging old-growth trees in
Yosemite National Park," Hansen said. "It's a commercial logging plan
masquerading as ecosystem restoration and fire protection."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen said that aggressive fire suppression in the park dates
back to just after World War II, and that the big trees being
considered for the ax in some cases are 150 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the same sort of subterfuge we've seen from the Bush
administration in the national forests," said Hansen, who believes
that Yosemite should stick to controlled burns to reduce flammable
slash and debris.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen said the removal of the big trees will harm wildlife while
actually increasing the fire risk. Mature trees are more
fire-resistant, he said, and opening up the forest canopy allows more
sunlight that creates drier conditions on the ground and more rapid
growth of flammable shrubs.</TE>

<HD>President Tours Rebel Territory</HD>
<DH>Philippines: Leader pays respects to a slain hostage and
lauds troops for rescue in a visit to underscore government control
of the area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAMITAN, Philippines</DL>
<LD>President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo saluted troops who rescued a U.S.
missionary and mourned the deaths of two other hostages during a tour
Tuesday through southern islands terrorized by Muslim guerrillas.</LD>
<LD>   Scores of soldiers patrolled the streets, and two tanks guarded
the Roman Catholic school where the Philippine leader met with
military and local officials in this town on Basilan island, a base
for the Abu Sayyaf rebels.</LD>
<LD>   Arroyo's visit and her plans to spend the night in Lamitan, where
troops have battled rebels in the streets, were designed to show that
the government controls the area.</LD>
<TE>   Her trip came four days after Philippine troops freed U.S. hostage
Gracia Burnham, whom the rebels held for more than a year. Burnham's
husband, Martin, and Philippine hostage Deborah Yap were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Before flying to Basilan, Arroyo stopped at Mindanao island, where
Gracia Burnham was rescued and the others died. The president saluted
the elite forces involved in the mission and called on them to crush
the remnants of the group.</TE>
<TE>   "The Filipinos and the world are proud of you," she said. "All
eyes are on you so we can win this final phase."</TE>
<TE>   In Lamitan, Yap's hometown, Arroyo placed flowers on the hostage's
white coffin and embraced her relatives. The president planned to
raise the Philippine flag in the town today, the country's
Independence Day.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo was "100% safe" in Lamitan, said Maj. Gen. Ernesto
Carolina, who heads southern Philippine military forces.</TE>
<TE>   No major clashes have been reported since the military launched an
offensive over the weekend to wipe out the rebels on the islands of
Jolo, Basilan and Mindanao. The area is in the extreme southwest of
the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina said that troops were closing in on the guerrillas but
that chasing them was difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like looking for a needle in a haystack," Carolina said.
"The only difference is that this needle is moving. It is breathing,
and it shoots back."</TE>
<TE>   One abandoned guerrilla with leg wounds was found Tuesday about
four miles from the rescue site, said regional police director Simeon
Dizon.</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf rebels, who have been linked to the Al Qaeda
terrorist network, say they want to create a Muslim state in the
southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Their forces in Basilan are thought to number fewer than 100, down
from more than 1,200 a year ago, after a military offensive. About
140 more are scattered in Jolo and Zamboanga, Carolina said.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo also met with Air Force Brig. Gen. Donald Wurster,
commander of an American force training and advising Philippine
troops fighting the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Wurster told Arroyo that the troops should not be disheartened by
the two hostages' deaths because "in any gunfight, things can happen
bad."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: Palestinian prisoner describes scouting out
targets and evading Israeli forces as he drove would-be 'martyrs' to
their deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Armed with an Israeli ID card that eased his movement through
roadblocks, Ibrahim Sarachne became something of a chauffeur and
guide for suicide bombers.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian car thief and 33-year-old father of six described
in a jailhouse interview Tuesday how he drove or led four aspiring
suicide bombers on three separate missions to blow up Israelis.
Sarachne also said that he scouted out bombing sites for maximum
crowd size and provided maps to the bombers.</LD>
<LD>   Three of his charges were successful and killed five Israelis.
Sarachne, who lived in the Dahaisha refugee camp near Bethlehem,
seemed to take pride in his ability to skirt large-scale deployments
of Israeli security forces and to maneuver in Jerusalem and other
parts of Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Sarachne's account--given in Hebrew to a small group of reporters
in the presence of agents from Israel's domestic General Security
Service, known as the Shin Bet--offered a glimpse into the relatively
uncomplicated logistics of the attacks that have so terrorized
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not have legal counsel. He appeared interested in
talking to reporters so that he might be able to work out a deal that
would result in his going into exile instead of receiving a long
prison sentence, an unlikely prospect. He said he had been treated
"OK" during interrogation since his arrest in late May, but the Shin
Bet agents cut off further questions about his treatment.</TE>
<TE>   By his admission, Sarachne transported little-trained bombers from
Bethlehem to two sites in Jerusalem and a third in the town of Rishon
Le Zion, near Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   "From Bethlehem to Rishon, look at the distance," he boasted.
"Your closures don't help at all. Rishon, Tel Aviv, Haifa--it's not a
problem. No one will think twice."</TE>
<TE>   Shin Bet agents likewise said they were keen to demonstrate the
ease with which an Israeli ID permitted Sarachne to traverse the
area, despite rigorous restrictions, military barricades and
closures. Thousands of Palestinians who reside in Jerusalem or have
parents living there have such IDs; Sarachne holds one by virtue of
his father's residency in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Sarachne was seated on a chair in a spartan room in Jerusalem's
main police headquarters, known as the Russian Compound. Wiry and
balding, he wore sneakers without laces and frequently crossed his
arms over his chest. He professed to not be particularly political or
religious.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks after Sarachne got out of an Israeli jail where he
had been serving time for attempted car theft, he said, he was
approached by a militant from the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia
affiliated with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement. The gunman, whom he identified as Mohammed Iyad Said,
recruited Sarachne to help find targets and deliver bombers to them.</TE>
<TE>   On March 29, Sarachne said, he drove his red Toyota pickup with
yellow Israeli plates to a hilly road just outside Bethlehem. There
he retrieved Hayat Akhras, 18, then drove her to a suburban Jerusalem
supermarket where Israelis were shopping ahead of the Jewish Sabbath.
She killed herself, an Israeli woman her age and a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   On the way to the supermarket, a calm Akhras rode with the bomb in
a shoulder bag at her feet, Sarachne said. They made chitchat until
about five minutes before arriving. " 'If you want to back out,' " he
recalled telling her, " 'I'll throw that bomb out.' But she said
no.... She wasn't afraid. She said she wanted to kill people.... She
said she was ready to die."</TE>
<TE>   He dropped her off and, about five minutes later, heard the sirens
of ambulances and police cars. He turned on Israeli Army Radio and
learned of the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "I was happy that she had succeeded," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, and again on Said's instructions, Sarachne was
leading a two-car convoy through Arab villages and into Jerusalem.
The bomber was riding in the second car. Sarachne described him as a
youth in his late teens from the Dahaisha camp who had made a
farewell video and wanted to become a martyr.</TE>
<TE>   They came upon a surprise checkpoint at downtown Jerusalem's
Haneviim Street. Sarachne was showing his ID to a policewoman when
the bomber, apparently realizing he would be caught, sent his driver
away and blew himself up. One policeman was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Sarachne had the presence of mind--and criminal guile, say his
captors--to demand his ID back from the policewoman even amid the
chaos of the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   On May 22, Sarachne took his wife and 18-month-old daughter along
on his next mission. They drove in one car and were followed by a
pair of suicide bombers--a 20-year-old woman and a 16-year-old
boy--in a second stolen vehicle. They used hand-held radios to
communicate between the cars, speaking in a kind of code.</TE>
<TE>   The destination was Rishon Le Zion, where Sarachne had scouted a
target two days earlier: a crowded pedestrian mall "where you can
kill a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   He gave maps to the two aspiring bombers and instructed them when
to get out of the car and where to go. Fifteen minutes after the
three parted ways, the woman, Arina Ahmed, suddenly backed out. She
radioed to Sarachne to pick her up. "She was begging, pleading: 'I
want to go back home. Get me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sarachne called the handler in Bethlehem and asked what to do. The
handler instructed Sarachne to retrieve both bombers. Sarachne
thought that would be dangerous and hesitated. But soon he returned
to where the two were waiting, had them talk to the handler and gave
them cab fare to go home. The boy, Issa Badir, said he wanted to
proceed with the original plan; about four hours later, he did,
blowing himself up near a group of retirees playing chess. Two
Israelis were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Sarachne ended up driving Ahmed back to Bethlehem. He claims that
his wife realized what was going on only during the ride back. But
security agents have arrested her too; a native of Ukraine, she had
been using another woman's ID and was initially identified by
authorities as an Israeli Jew.</TE>
<TE>   Sarachne has another wife, a Muslim Palestinian, whom he married
first. They have five children.</TE>
<TE>   Said directed Sarachne in the first two missions. But when Israeli
troops invaded Bethlehem on April 2, Said was among several hundred
Palestinians who hid in the Church of the Nativity. In a deal to end
the monthlong siege that followed, Said and 12 other Palestinian
fighters were exiled to European countries.</TE>
<TE>   Sarachne would not identify the handler for the third mission.
That man has also been arrested by Israel, according to the Shin Bet,
along with what the agency has identified as a four-member cell based
in Dahaisha.</TE>
<TE>   In describing his motives, Sarachne said it was important for
Dahaisha to take a greater role in the current conflict. He recalled
the camp's activism in the first intifada, which ended in 1993, and
said he had wanted to recapture some of that fame.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives and Palestinian security sources in Dahaisha have
suggested that Sarachne was transporting bombers only for money, or
to dispel rumors that he had collaborated with Israel. But he said
Tuesday that he was not coerced and did what he did because he was
good at it.</TE>
<TE>   He did not show remorse for helping kill Jews, even though he said
he has had Israeli friends. He worked for years in West Jerusalem and
Israel, in kitchens at a yeshiva, or religious school, and other
ultra-Orthodox Jewish establishments. He came to know the lay of the
land well.</TE>
<TE>   If he has committed any crimes, he said, they are minor compared
with those of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his army.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to what Sharon and his people did, I'm zero," he said.</TE>

<LD>   New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark called a snap election for
July 27, betting on a commanding lead in polls and declaring a
gridlocked Parliament "farcical."</LD>
<LD>   The polls indicate that Clark's coalition would win a majority of
the 120 seats in the single-chamber Parliament, although the last
time an early election was called, in 1984, the government was dumped
at the polls.</LD>
<TE>   Clark said that it was time to "clear the air" and that Parliament
had become farcical after constant opposition attacks on the junior
party in her minority coalition, the left-wing Alliance, which split
into two factions in April.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Will Increase Food Aid</HD>
<DH>Africa: Contribution is to go to U.N. fight against hunger.
Zimbabwe is blamed for its problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>The United States said Tuesday that it will provide a third of the
1.2 million tons of food aid needed to stave off famine in southern
Africa, a crisis it said is being exacerbated by Zimbabwe's policies.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Natsios, the head of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, said the United States is contributing an extra 275,000
tons of wheat to the U.N. emergency relief effort for six African
countries, bringing its total to 400,000 tons.</LD>
<LD>   However, Natsios told a news conference on the sidelines of the
U.N. World Food Summit that the problem in Zimbabwe, one of the six
affected countries, isn't about food so much as food distribution.</LD>
<TE>   Natsios said he was concerned by reports that President Robert
Mugabe's government is preventing food aid from getting to opposition
strongholds.</TE>
<TE>   "We've even heard of children whose parents are suspected of
supporting the opposition being turned away from feeding lines at
schools," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The World Food Program says half of the estimated 12.8 million
people at risk of starvation in southern Africa are in Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe's government has denied the opposition's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the World Food Program, James Morris, said he had
raised the issue with Mugabe and had received assurances that aid
would get through.</TE>
<TE>   He said, however, that Zimbabwe's land redistribution program has
complicated relief efforts and contributed to the hunger problem. He
cited a 55% decrease in commercial agricultural productivity this
year over previous ones.</TE>

<HD>Soccer Devotees Cry 'Sacre Bleu!' Over Cruel Loss</HD>
<DH>France: Fans of the national team quietly swallow their
pride after its ouster from the World Cup. And they kick off a blame
game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Nobody rioted here Tuesday after France lost to Denmark in the World
Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike Russian fans who went berserk in Moscow last weekend,
nobody got brutally drunk, attacked foreigners or committed
soccer-induced homicide in France, despite a humiliating debacle that
caused the first elimination of a defending champion in the
tournament's opening round since 1966.</LD>
<LD>   It's just a game, the elaborate Parisian shrugs and
tighter-than-usual lips seemed to say. It's the end of the World Cup
for us, not the end of the world.</LD>
<TE>   But beneath the show of sang-froid, the French were crushed.</TE>
<TE>   You could tell from the tears streaking blue-painted faces
congregated at a giant screen showing the game outside City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   You could tell from the funereal gait of pedestrians on a sunny
Champs-Elysees plastered with suddenly forlorn ads, posters and
magazine covers glorifying the suddenly fallen champions, the
once-beloved national team known as "Les Bleus."</TE>
<TE>   You could tell from the epic sigh of the young counterman in a
cafe in the Rue de Passy shopping district across the river from the
Eiffel Tower. When a postgame customer had the nerve to ask how he
was doing, the clerk responded simply, morosely, accusingly: "So,
which team are you rooting for?"</TE>
<TE>   Les Bleus gave France the blues Tuesday. Forget Waterloo. The new
capital of the geography of grief was Inchon, South Korea. It was the
site of the game and the scene of the crime, where the Danes won 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Defeat tasted especially bitter because the French roster featured
some of the world's best-paid and most gifted players. This country
fell in love with the team, and the sport of soccer, after hosting
the World Cup in 1998 and winning it.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, millions of revelers celebrated their championship
in the streets. Politicians, pundits and other manufacturers of
instant symbols decided that the dashing multiethnic team was an
ideal banner of national pride and cross-cultural brotherhood.</TE>
<TE>   And this year, soccer-mania had generated more interest and
excitement than politics. One factor accounting for the record-low
turnout in Sunday's legislative elections was that many voters were
too busy watching the games to go to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   So it was hard to believe that the titans who brought down mighty
Brazil four years ago packed their bags and trudged toward the exit
without having won a game in World Cup 2002. The defenseless
defending champions did not manage to score a single goal in the
tourney--an embarrassing historical first.</TE>
<TE>   "Les Bleus, the champions of the world and the champions of
Europe, have left by the back door, and that's the least that can be
said even if we want to be gentle ... with this once-untouchable
team," wrote sports commentator Jean-Marc Mena. "Today, tomorrow,
each of us will use and abuse the guillotine. Perhaps it will be the
fault of [Coach] Roger Lemerre, the referees, the calendar, bad luck,
the goal posts."</TE>
<TE>   This being France, sidewalk philosophers were on hand to provide
theories and analyses. A common conclusion: The group that has won
several European championships along with the World Cup since 1996
has aged badly.</TE>
<TE>   "New blood!" chanted despondent viewers at a sports cafe in the
city of Lyon.</TE>
<TE>   Massive paychecks and inflated egos were also to blame, others
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm going to root for Tunisia and especially Senegal because
they aren't rolling in money," said a 62-year-old Parisian cabdriver
who gave his name as Hacine. "Maybe that's one of the explanations
for France: Too much money is not good."</TE>
<TE>   An undeniable weakness was the fateful injury to superstar
Zinedine Zidane, the midfielder who is considered the top player in
the sport today. The smooth, quietly spectacular Zidane, the
Marseille-born son of an Algerian immigrant, missed the first two
games. His absence hurt. But his return from the injured list Tuesday
had die-hards predicting that salvation was at hand, even though
France would have had to win by two goals to advance to the next
round.</TE>
<TE>   It was painful to watch an out-of-form Zidane hobble bravely
through the battle against Denmark with a heavily bandaged thigh. The
heralded savior failed his followers, but they said it wasn't all his
fault.</TE>
<TE>   "Zidane isn't the French team all by himself. The team has 11
players," said Adriano Ribero, a Frenchman of Portuguese descent who
was in the crowd of 5,000 watching the game in front of City Hall.
"They played badly--very, very badly. This wasn't worthy of a
national team."</TE>
<TE>   The French are into soccer, but the top league's fervor, pay scale
and quality do not quite match those of powerhouses such as Italy,
Spain and England.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 World Cup did give soccer a bigger audience, including
women and girls, such as three 15-year-olds at City Hall who had
painted the French flag and player David Trezeguet's name on their
faces. But the catastrophe left one fan with a serious case of the
doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've kind of lost interest," said Guillaume Fousse, 31, a
video technician. "Today it's over. I'll have to find another team to
support. But I'm not sure if my interest in soccer will continue."</TE>
<TE>   Political leaders who once basked in the champions' glory preached
restraint and loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Although President Jacques Chirac admitted to being "profoundly
disappointed," he urged the team to overcome the loss and preserve
France as a "global leader" in soccer. Prime Minister Jean-Pierre
Raffarin sent a message of sympathy to Les Bleus. He warned fickle
fans not to "burn today what we adored yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Talk of burning and guillotines can't have helped the mood of the
vanquished squad. The players will return to an already introspective
nation with a talent for melancholy and a strong new reason for some
world-class brooding.</TE>
<TE>   "Les Bleus have been eliminated, we have been eliminated," wrote
Mena, the commentator. "Condemned to rebuild, condemned to hang our
heads."</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Heads to S. Asia for Talks</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The Defense secretary will attempt to follow up
on diminished stresses between India and Pakistan when he meets with
their leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld began a peace mission to India
and Pakistan on Tuesday, aiming to build on an easing of tensions
that had brought the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of war over
the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, President Bush said American efforts to lower the
heat had made progress, but he cautioned that with 1 million troops
in place along the India-Pakistan border, the risk of war had not
passed. India did announce earlier that it was ordering warships back
to port, and it has reopened its airspace to Pakistani flights.</LD>
<LD>   "The situation is getting better, but so long as there's troops
amassed and people are still hostile, there's always a threat
something could happen," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said that although recent comments from the South Asian
neighbors had been positive, intelligence data appeared to suggest
that the situation on the ground had not improved as much as the
public statements implied.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot say that I see a trend line that is getting better or
worse. It feels to me like it's roughly level," he told reporters
traveling with him from Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   "What's important is what actually happens on the ground, as
opposed to words, but words are helpful," Rumsfeld added.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld was due to meet Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and
key Indian ministers today before heading to Islamabad, the Pakistani
capital, for talks with President Pervez Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary said he had come as a "friend" rather than a
mediator and not with a set remedy. "First of all, we're not going in
with a single proposal, and nor am I a mediator as such," Rumsfeld
said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian analysts said a key challenge for Rumsfeld would be to find
a way acceptable to both sides to verify a commitment from Musharraf
that he would stop Pakistan-based militants from infiltrating the
Indian-ruled portion of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf told a news conference in Abu Dhabi at the end of a
visit to the United Arab Emirates, "The real response that we are
looking for is initiation of a dialogue ... on the core Kashmir
dispute and all the other issues which bedevil relations between
India and Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   At least eight people, including four members of one Pakistani
family, were reported killed Tuesday in what has become a daily
exchange of artillery and mortar fire across the Line of Control that
divides the two nations in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 1998 and have
ballistic missiles. A special envoy of Musharraf, however, said in
Paris that there was a "zero percent" chance of nuclear conflict.</TE>

<HD>Suicide Bomber Kills Girl in Israeli Restaurant Attack</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Nine other diners are hurt. Meanwhile, scattered
deaths and injuries are reported by both Palestinians and Jews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The man with the beard and the big green shirt sauntered into a steak
restaurant in the coastal town of Herzliya on Tuesday, asked for a
bottle of water and blew himself up. Ten wounded diners were hurried
to the hospital as the sun set into the sea. A teenage girl survived
for a few hours, then died of her wounds.</LD>
<LD>   "It's horrible when innocent civilians--men, women and
children--just out to get a bite to eat are hurt," said Yael German,
mayor of the town near Tel Aviv. The dinner-time suicide attack
capped a day of scattered civilian deaths and injuries among both
Israelis and Palestinians, as low-level warfare simmered throughout
Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, three 15-year-old Israeli boys were injured when a bomb
exploded near the gate of an orchard in the West Bank. The high
school students had spent the morning picking cherries and were
waiting for a bus home when they stumbled across the bomb, apparently
planted by Palestinian militants. Many Palestinian radicals object
passionately to the growth of Israeli settlements on lands west of
the Jordan River.</LD>
<TE>   "We should remember that the Palestinians are trying to kill us
everywhere," local councilman Zvi Bar-Hai told Israeli radio. "We
should understand that this is war, and fight back."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian government immediately condemned the Herzliya
bombing. But Palestinians were grappling with deaths of their own. In
the tiny Gazan village of Al Mograka, 8-year-old Hussein Matwi died
when gunfire struck his family's home from the direction of a
neighboring settlement. A second boy, 13, was badly injured in the
shooting, Palestinian security officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In a hospital in Egypt, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy died of
wounds he suffered when he was shot last week near a Jewish
settlement in Gaza. The boy's family lived near the settlement, and
he was walking home when he was gunned down, Palestinians said.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, a 23-year-old man was blown up in a botched
attempt to plant a bomb near an Israeli border fence southeast of
Gaza City. Hamas, a radical Islamic organization, claimed that the
accidental suicide bomber was a member of its military wing. He died
just hours after another Hamas member was shot to death in the Gaza
Strip after he opened fire on a passing convoy of Jewish settlers.
Israeli soldiers guarding the procession of cars shot back, killing
the 22-year-old militant.</TE>
<TE>   On the main drag of East Jerusalem, a predominantly Arab area, an
Israeli border policeman was seriously wounded Tuesday when a man
slit his throat and disappeared into the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the flurry of attacks, Israeli soldiers kept up a relentless
siege of Ramallah, where Tuesday they arrested Abdul Rahim Mallouh,
deputy secretary of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   Mallouh is an assistant to Ahmed Saadat, who is in a Palestinian
jail for allegedly plotting the October assassination of Israeli
Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi. The militant Saadat has been locked
up for months even though he was never charged or tried. Last week, a
Palestinian court found that no evidence linked Saadat to the crime,
and it ordered him freed. But Israeli officials threatened to "bring
justice to him" if he walked free, and Palestinians kept Saadat
behind bars for his own protection.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty other activists were taken into custody in Ramallah, and
soldiers seized caches of bombs. The raid kept Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat locked down in the remains of his battered
compound for a second day. Israeli soldiers also clamped a curfew on
the city of Tulkarm and moved briefly into a refugee camp near
Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   In another West Bank city, Hebron, the bodies of two Palestinians
suspected of feeding intelligence information to Israel turned up.
Palestinian police found the pair of corpses in a field where an Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade leader, Marwan Zalloum, was gunned down by an
Israeli helicopter earlier this spring. The militant group, which is
associated with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement, claimed responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   As the unrest continued, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
appeared Tuesday on Capitol Hill, which has been a reliable source of
political and financial support for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon thanked Congress for its "solidarity and backing" after a
meeting with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The
committee's chairman, Joseph R. Biden (D-Del.), responded: "There is
no disagreement in this country on support for Israel. We support
Israel, period."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. aid to Israel totals about $2.8 billion annually, and a bill
pending in Congress would increase that amount by about $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Janet Hook and Robin Wright in Washington
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Crackdown Gives Rise to Doubts</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Curbing Islamic extremism is widely seen as key
to easing tensions over Kashmir. But to some, it borders on betrayal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANSEHRA, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>The first hint of a government crackdown against Muslim extremist
groups in this dusty market town came in January, local businessman
Jamil Ahmed recalls.</LD>
<LD>   That's when police told him to stop collecting money for the
militant Al Badr organization, which for nearly a decade ran a
training camp in the nearby hills. Locals say it was one of eight
such camps in the Mansehra area that turned young Pakistani
volunteers into Islamic warriors--known as jihadis--and then launched
them across the frontier to fight in the Indian-controlled portion of
disputed Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   By March, jihadi recruiting posters that had lined the streets of
this town in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province for years quietly
came down, as did billboards proclaiming Indian atrocities against
the predominantly Muslim Kashmiris. Then, Ahmed and other residents
say, the camps themselves were closed about two months ago and those
who ran them vanished.</LD>
<TE>   For political moderates here and in India, that's good news.</TE>
<TE>   Curtailing the jihadi groups is widely viewed as a vital first
step in scaling back a crisis that has led India and Pakistan to mass
about 1 million troops on their border and raised the frightening
prospect of the world's first war between two nuclear-armed states.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani officials say the crackdown in Mansehra is part of a
broader move against Islamic militant groups that began tentatively
this year and appears to have gradually gained greater purpose.
Leaders of many of the militant groups were detained last month,
according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there is little visible evidence in Mansehra of either the
jihadis or their cause.</TE>
<TE>   After initial skepticism, India appears to have accepted that
Pakistan has stopped militants from crossing the so-called Line of
Control that divides Kashmir, but the extent to which their
activities inside Pakistan have been halted remains unclear. India,
for example, says that at least three training camps still operate in
the area around Mansehra--a charge that Pakistan rejects.</TE>
<TE>   "I can say with authority there are no training camps operating
now," declared army Brig. Javed Iqbal Cheema, who is leading
Pakistan's efforts to shut down the extremist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Locals, however, refused to take a foreign reporter to visit the
camp locations, saying they were afraid of possible reprisals from
"the agencies"--a reference to Pakistani intelligence organizations,
including the Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, that for years
have been the jihadis' main backers within the country's military
establishment.</TE>
<TE>   The government's follow-up on the initial arrests of suspected
militant group members has also raised questions about the
crackdown's effectiveness. For example, 21 militants arrested here in
April under an anti-terrorism law were set free recently for lack of
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   For President Pervez Musharraf, shutting off support for the
jihadi groups means stepping back from a decade-old strategy: using
religiously motivated fighters to harass India with a persistent, but
effective, low-grade guerrilla campaign in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The mountainous, spectacularly beautiful territory, claimed by
India and Pakistan, has been the object of two of their three wars in
the last 55 years. After suffering defeat twice in conventional
conflicts at the hands of superior Indian forces in Kashmir, Pakistan
embraced the jihadis in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Although government support for the jihadis has always been denied
publicly, the groups for years recruited openly, published magazines,
solicited donations and operated sophisticated training camps.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Al Badr leader Bakht Zameen even brought a group of
Pakistani reporters based in Peshawar to the group's camp near here
to watch a colorful graduation ceremony for recruits who had
completed basic training before heading for Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of discipline was amazing," said one witness who
declined to be identified. "It was like watching an army."</TE>
<TE>   A 22-year-old volunteer jihadi from Peshawar who used the nom de
guerre Uqab said in an interview this week that his main training
camp instructors were retired Pakistani army members. He went through
a camp run by the Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen group two years ago near
Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistani-held portion of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Uqab said the camp offered three types of courses, including
three-week basic training and a special forces session that taught
recruits how to use a variety of weapons, including hand grenades and
rocket launchers. The third course lasted six months and was for
suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few people are selected for this course," Uqab said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, actions attributed to the jihadi groups,
including a daylight attack in December on the Indian Parliament in
New Delhi, have exacerbated political tensions between the two
nations.</TE>
<TE>   For Musharraf, moving against the Islamic militants carries
considerable domestic risks in a country where the struggle to break
India's grip over Kashmir is imbibed with mother's milk.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's vociferous fundamentalist Islamic minority already
resents Musharraf's decision to abandon Afghanistan's Taliban
government and side with America and the West in the war against
international terrorism after Sept. 11. Some now see Musharraf's
clampdown on the Kashmir militants as dangerously close to betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't happy about this," said Junus Khattak, a local
leader of Pakistan's largest religious-based party, Jamaat-i-Islami.
"Jihadi groups should be allowed to operate [in Kashmir]. Their fight
is on the side of good, on the side of the oppressed."</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest danger for Musharraf as he moves forward might not
be from an angry populace but from disgruntled elements within his
ruling establishment, including the ISI and senior ranks of the army.</TE>
<TE>   Some officers in both institutions see the guerrilla campaign not
just as an effective and low-cost response to India's huge military
superiority but also as part of a far larger global struggle to end
the oppression of Muslims. As such, these officers have developed
strong loyalties to the militants.</TE>
<TE>   "Pakistan had success diplomatically after Sept. 11 when it became
the centerpiece of an anti-terror campaign, but militarily, it has
suffered a huge setback in Kashmir," said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, a
regional specialist at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, the
capital. "The question now is if this really leads to a de-escalation
and genuine dialogue for a peaceful settlement of the issue."</TE>
<TE>   International diplomatic efforts, such as Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld's visit to the region this week, are expected to dwell on
measures to verify the frontier's stability and to coax both sides to
pull back military forces and, eventually, begin talks.</TE>
<TE>   Many Pakistanis worry that Musharraf has conceded too much. With
the jihadis cut off from Indian-controlled areas, they fear, India's
security forces are likely to move more freely against indigenous
Kashmiri separatist groups. Any such action from New Delhi would put

<HD>Afghan Delegates Question Assembly's Independence</HD>
<DH>Asia: Selection of Karzai as leader appears certain after
another candidate drops out. Some in the loya jirga claim process was
fixed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The last serious presidential challenger to interim leader Hamid
Karzai withdrew his candidacy Tuesday, enhancing the impression among
many delegates to this nation's grand assembly that the selection had
been fixed by foreign advisors and those already in power.</LD>
<LD>   Former President Burhanuddin Rabbani's announcement that he was
bowing out led to speculation among observers and delegates that he
had been promised a prestigious post.</LD>
<LD>   Rabbani, an ethnic Tajik who was president during the four-year
period of bloody terror that preceded the Taliban's rise to power in
1996, probably had little chance of being elected president because
the nation's largest ethnic group, the Pushtuns, appears to dominate
the council.</LD>
<TE>   Many delegates to the chaotic assembly, or loya jirga, that is
Afghanistan's traditional forum for choosing its leaders were still
smarting from the news a day earlier that Mohammad Zaher Shah, the
nation's former king, would not run for an executive position or seek
restoration of the monarchy.</TE>
<TE>   The loya jirga's planned Monday opening was delayed by more than a
day while President Bush's special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, lobbied
Zaher Shah to "clarify" that the former king was not a rival to
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech of less than five minutes that opened the loya jirga
in late afternoon, Zaher Shah urged Afghans to choose Karzai, the
nation's interim prime minister, as head of the transitional
government that will serve until elections planned for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to be of service after long years of being away," the
87-year-old former monarch told about 2,000 citizens assembled in an
air-conditioned tent erected on a soccer field. "By the will of God,
after 29 years of exile, I am back in my country with my nation."</TE>
<TE>   Saying his only wish was to help bring peace, reconciliation and
prosperity to his shattered country, Zaher Shah--seated and speaking
barely above a whisper--urged the delegates to cast their votes for
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   With his decision to step aside, only Dr. Massooda Jalal of the
World Food Program was expected to challenge Karzai for the post. She
was given little chance of success.</TE>
<TE>   The former king's decision apparently was made at the urging of
Western diplomats, who acknowledge that they warned Zaher Shah behind
closed doors that his election as head of state--even in a reduced
ceremonial role--would anger Tajik warlords. Karzai has maintained a
fragile power-sharing agreement with the Tajiks, giving them control
of the army, police and intelligence service.</TE>
<TE>   Some Western officials feared that Defense Minister Mohammed
Qassim Fahim might deploy tanks to the site to disrupt the loya
jirga. Intelligence chief Mohammed Arif had already dispatched
plainclothes gunmen to the tent in what delegates saw as an attempt
at intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Rabbani's withdrawal as a presidential candidate,
Interior Minister Younis Qanooni announced to the delegates that he
was offering to resign to allow the loya jirga a freer hand "to
determine our destination."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want this to be about posts and positions," the Tajik
warrior said on behalf of the Northern Alliance, the coalition of
regional armies that helped drive the Taliban from power last fall.
"As interior minister of the interim government, I am ready to leave
my position for the sake of peace and unity and so that the delegates
may choose whomever they see fit."</TE>
<TE>   Like the rest of the current ministers', Qanooni's position
expires this month with the conclusion of the weeklong loya jirga,
and it wasn't clear that his offer was accepted. But his voluntary
retreat signaled a willingness of the powerful Tajiks to compromise,
an apparent quid pro quo for the decision of the former king, who is
a Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a democracy. This is a rubber stamp," said a fuming
Sima Samar, Karzai's deputy and minister for women's affairs.
"Everything has already been decided by the powerful ones."</TE>
<TE>   Confusion and logistical glitches as well as the mounting signs of
orchestration have plagued the gathering. The chairman of the
organizing committee, Ismail Qasimyar, suggested that Karzai had
already been chosen as president by the round of applause that
greeted his nomination by Zaher Shah. Karzai added to the impression
that his new term as leader is a done deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It is finished. The assembly has voted for me," Karzai told
Reuters news agency, one of the few media outlets allowed inside the
tent, which is cordoned off by police and international peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   But Karzai's advisors and Western diplomats monitoring the loya
jirga said his election was pending a formal vote.</TE>
<TE>   "His majesty the former king has nominated Mr. Karzai to head the
transitional government. The nomination was received with wide
acclaim, but that doesn't constitute an election," said Ashref Ghani,
one of Karzai's closest advisors and a delegate at the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   No formal votes were taken on the first day. Organizers were still
sorting out who among those gathered in the tent were valid delegates
and who were guests and observers erroneously issued ballots upon
arrival.</TE>
<TE>   The assembly is supposed to include the former king, 1,050
delegates elected on the local level and an additional 450 people
chosen by the organizers to represent women, intellectuals, refugees
and other groups. However, at least 1,700 people were given voting
cards, loya jirga spokesman Abdul Salam Rahimi said.</TE>
<TE>   A Western diplomat among those observing the proceedings explained
that the issue of who could vote still hadn't been sorted out by the
opening time, so organizers decided to proceed only with those agenda
items that did not involve balloting. That is why there was no leader
of the loya jirga selected despite that having been listed as the
first order of business.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of management problems," said the diplomat,
who requested anonymity. "Organization is not a strong suit for this
group."</TE>
<TE>   But some delegates complained bitterly that the forum was a sham
and that the decisions about Afghanistan's future already had been
made.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no need to spend $7 million to bring these people
together. Everything has been prearranged," Homayoom Asefi, a
supporter of the former king, told journalists before the session got
underway.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the urging of some angry advocates of a role for the king,
Asefi said delegates would refrain from walking out because that
would destroy a historic opportunity to guide Afghanistan into a more
stable future.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai confidant Ghani insisted that the claims of political
rigging were exaggerated by "a very vocal minority."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the widest gathering of Afghans in a quarter-century, and
Afghans are not people who can be told what to do," he said. "We are
very independent-minded."</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah was bestowed with the affectionate title of "Baba," or
father of the nation, and Karzai said the former king should carry
out various ceremonial functions such as awarding medals and honors
and attending important legislative and constitutional sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's proposal--during one of three addresses he made to the
delegates--was thunderously applauded, which committee Chairman
Qasimyar and even official Radio Kabul reported was tantamount to the
loya jirga's formal approval.</TE>

<HD>Slowly Stalking an Afghan 'Lion'</HD>
<DH>The assassins of Northern Alliance chief faced weeks of
delays until finally he met with them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG PYES and WILLIAM C. REMPEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>When Sept. 11 dawned here, charismatic Northern Alliance leader Ahmed
Shah Masoud was stashed in a refrigerator at a Tajikistan
morgue--killed 48 hours earlier by Al Qaeda assassins. His death was
a desperate secret.</LD>
<LD>   A cadre of close aides and officers hid his body--and the
truth--while his outnumbered resistance fighters clung to tenuous
positions under relentless attack by Taliban and Al Qaeda forces.</LD>
<LD>   Fearing collapse of alliance defenses if word got out, the aides
manufactured a fog of disinformation. Hardly anyone was informed--not
the field commanders, not even the dead leader's family.</LD>
<TE>   He suffered an accident--only minor injuries, they said. And for
days, those lies kept the resistance intact.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard about the assassination, I was 100% sure that the
resistance would be over in a matter of days," recalled one of
Masoud's closest advisors, Foreign Minister Abdullah, in a recent
interview.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat of the Northern Alliance was much closer than
authorities have previously acknowledged. Had Masoud's forces been
dispersed, as Abdullah feared, the U.S. military would have lost a
surrogate ground force--even before its need was evident. And
American troops almost certainly would have been required sooner in
Afghanistan and would have been deployed at much greater risk.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda targeted Masoud to eliminate the last obstacle to Taliban
control of all of Afghanistan. Masoud was also an impediment to Osama
bin Laden's grand plan to create an Islamic empire beyond
Afghanistan's northern borders in Central Asia. Some American
officials believe that the killing was a personal gift to Taliban
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar from Bin Laden--in gratitude for the
sanctuary provided to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   A four-month Times investigation found that Masoud, 48, was
assassinated nearly three weeks later than planned. The killers posed
as journalists, living and traveling among Masoud's top aides,
including his intelligence and military chiefs--apparently without
raising serious suspicions. But they repeatedly failed to gain access
to him.</TE>
<TE>   The killers were welcomed into Northern Alliance territory by a
high-ranking resistance official with old ties to Bin Laden and
Taliban leaders who said that they came recommended by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   The plot was carried out by a Europe-based Tunisian terrorist
cell, likely as repayment to Al Qaeda for training at its Afghan
terrorist camps.</TE>
<TE>   CIA officials were among the handful of insiders informed of
Masoud's death. After Sept. 11, the CIA rushed to save the Northern
Alliance. Agents helped wire its shaken elements back together and
turned resistance fighters into an offensive force that helped sweep
the Taliban from power.</TE>
<TE>   The story behind Masoud's assassination is a tale of a patient and
calculated plot that nearly undermined America's first steps in its
new war on terrorism. It was pieced together from records and scores
of interviews on three continents with witnesses, law enforcement
officials, intelligence agents and military leaders.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The two men with Moroccan passports carried camera equipment
aboard the aging Russian-made helicopter, one of the few working
machines in what was then a pathetic little air force serving the
Northern Alliance. They braced for the usual rough ride that late
summer day in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   They carried letters of introduction. They were television
journalists from a London Islamic center concerned with "human rights
issues for Muslims all over the world." One was noted to be the
center's best journalist. The other hid explosives in his battery
pack.</TE>
<TE>   In his rear base camp, Masoud was eager to meet
journalists--especially from the Muslim world. He was frustrated by
perceptions in the Middle East that his resistance fighters were in
league with the Russians and other foreigners against the interests
of fellow Muslims. Masoud seized every opportunity to argue that the
Taliban was oppressing Afghanistan with the assistance of foreign
Arabs and Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   There were other journalists on board. During the flight, one of
them videotaped the helicopter passenger compartment. It was typical
B-roll material. Filler. Atmospherics.</TE>
<TE>   The Moroccans ducked their heads, tucking their faces into scarves
and sleeves. One of the other journalists says he wondered why the
two Moroccans seemed to be hiding.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The crisis facing Northern Alliance forces on Sept. 11 had been
months in the making.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the spring and summer of 2001, as many as 16,000
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters had massed in Takhar province in the
north, a particular menace to Masoud's stronghold in the Panjshir
Valley. Intelligence confirmed that the Taliban planned a "final
offensive" to wrest complete control of the country, then infiltrate
the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud dispatched Abdullah, his trusted aide, to Washington in
July. He had been there before as an emissary for Masoud, seldom
getting beyond low-level State Department employees and think-tank
analysts. He was frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "They were having debates about moderate and non-moderate
Taliban," Abdullah said. "It was ridiculous. There are those who can
speak softly, but they are not moderate people."</TE>
<TE>   This time, Abdullah carried maps and reports on Taliban and Al
Qaeda troop concentrations. A Northern Alliance defeat would be
harmful to regional security and to U.S. interests, he argued. He
pressed the U.S. to intervene in two areas: by pressuring Pakistan to
stop supporting the Taliban and by providing arms and money to the
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   He sensed a shift with the Bush White House. For a change, he met
with senior State Department and National Security Council officials,
and he was invited to return in September for more talks. Abdullah
was hoping for a possible breakthrough. As early as 1997, the State
Department had advised him that its Afghan policy was "under review."
It still was "under review" as Abdullah left Washington in summer
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Afghanistan, where the Northern Alliance held barely 5% of
the country, Abdullah said leaders calculated what little
international support they could count on. "But Masoud thought that
one day the whole world will come to us. One day this will change.
But he said, 'I hope it's not too late.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A phone call had cleared the Moroccan journalists to enter
Northern Alliance territory--a good word from an Egyptian friend of
senior alliance official Abdul Rasul Sayyaf.</TE>
<TE>   Sayyaf knew the caller as Dr. Hani, an old friend from the jihad
against the Russians years earlier. He claimed to be calling from
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The resistance leader agreed to extend his
hospitality to the journalists for a few days and help arrange a tour
of the front lines.</TE>
<TE>   Bismillah Khan, one of Masoud's most trusted generals, led the
tour after getting Masoud's approval for the journalists' visit. He
was eager to show them that no foreigners, only Afghans, were
fighting for the alliance. The journalists seemed uninterested in
what they saw.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't ask many questions like other journalists," the
general recalled later. "They were very reserved."</TE>
<TE>   But no one challenged their credentials. They were Sayyaf's
guests.</TE>
<TE>   And it would be months before anyone could check the origins of
the phone call that persuaded Sayyaf to invite them behind alliance
lines. Investigators later would trace the phone number to Taliban
country--the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The visitors were both in their 30s. The reporter was slightly
older. He was called Karim Touzani--well-fed, affable and relaxed.
The cameraman called himself Kacem Bakkali. He seldom spoke in front
of others.</TE>
<TE>   There was one exception, an older brother of Masoud later heard.
It was during a bumpy car ride. The otherwise quiet Bakkali urgently
insisted that the driver slow down. The severe jostling, he said,
could damage his camera.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That the Northern Alliance was still intact on the morning of
Sept. 11 was a tribute to Masoud's forceful leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Even after a devastating blow the previous year when his former
headquarters at Taloqan was overrun, Masoud single-handedly persuaded
commanders, ethnic leaders and tribal factions to rally against the
Taliban. He persuaded Iran to give more financial support and Russia
to keep providing materiel.</TE>
<TE>   None of the country's major warlords--Uzbek Gen. Abdul Rashid
Dostum, Hazara leader Karim Khalili and Tajik Gen. Ismail Khan--was
in the country at the start of 2001, but Masoud coaxed them all back
by spring. They started carrying out harassing actions against
Taliban positions.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud had spent most of his adult life as a rebel. "Ever since I
was 20, I've been in hiding," he told a journalist a year before his
death.</TE>
<TE>   He made his legend as the "Lion of Panjshir" fighting Soviet
occupation forces in the 1980s. During that time, personal, ethnic
and political rivalries developed in the anti-Russian moujahedeen
camp between Masoud, an ethnic Tajik, and the ethnic Pushtun leaders
favored by the Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   Friction also was evident between Masoud and religious
fundamentalists, including Sayyaf and Bin Laden, both favorites of
the Saudis. Bin Laden and other future founders of Al Qaeda were
among the many Arabs who fought alongside Sayyaf during the war with
the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   After the Soviet defeat, Masoud served in the government of
President Burhanuddin Rabbani as defense minister. Sayyaf served as a
presidential aide. But warlord factionalism and fierce infighting led
to thousands of civilian deaths during a period when the U.S. kept
its diplomatic distance. In September 1996, Taliban militias swept
into Kabul, the capital, and toppled the Rabbani administration.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud withdrew to the north. The Taliban immediately imposed a
severe Islamic system--and issued a death decree for the fugitive
defense minister. Once again, Masoud was a rebel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after touring the Northern Alliance battle front, the
Moroccan journalists were escorted to another resistance stronghold
in the Panjshir Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A gathering of resistance leaders was underway--a shura, or
council, convened in a heavily guarded building. Sentries blocked the
journalists from entering.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud was inside. So was most of the top echelon of the Northern
Alliance--at one moment in one room.</TE>
<TE>   The journalists insisted on access. The sentries were unmoved. The
journalists pressed for a brief visit--a few quick camera angles,
nothing intrusive. One of the guards disappeared inside to seek
permission. It was denied.</TE>
<TE>   "We just need one shot," one of them persisted.</TE>
<TE>   Again a guard trudged back inside to present the visitors' case.
Again, it was denied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in 1998, CIA agents met with Masoud in Tajikistan. They
sought intelligence support and help capturing or assassinating Bin
Laden, whom they blamed for the bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud listened thoughtfully, according to alliance sources
familiar with the secret sessions in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital. But
he considered the Americans shortsighted. The Clinton administration
had made catching Bin Laden and destroying Al Qaeda the centerpiece
of its Afghan policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The main issue for me is the Taliban," Masoud said at the time.
"Without the Taliban, Osama can't do anything." Furthermore, Masoud
regarded Al Qaeda, the Taliban and its main backer, Pakistan, as "an
evil triangle" and a common threat.</TE>
<TE>   But "all of our talking points were bringing down Osama," said one
U.S. diplomat, noting that American policy until Sept. 11 was
influenced by the Pakistani idea of reforming the Taliban and working
with the regime.</TE>
<TE>   Yet evidence mounted that Bin Laden was steadily increasing his
influence over Omar and the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept warning about the growing 'Arabization' of Afghanistan,"
said a senior U.S. diplomat in Pakistan. "But no one was listening."</TE>
<TE>   About a year after the Masoud-CIA meeting, a powerful truck bomb
exploded just outside Omar's compound in Kandahar. Masoud agents were
responsible, U.S. and alliance officials now acknowledge. The
explosion reportedly killed 10, including three of Omar's bodyguards.
It left a crater the size of a tennis court. Omar narrowly escaped
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance operatives also attacked other Taliban targets but were
unable to penetrate Al Qaeda's security to mount attacks against Bin
Laden. "There wasn't any possibility to find him," an Afghan
intelligence officer said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For much of their visit, the journalists stayed in a guesthouse of
the Northern Alliance in the Panjshir Valley. They rarely went on
interviews. They asked few questions. They took little video footage.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Masoud arrived unexpectedly at the journalists' door.</TE>
<TE>   By chance, the two men were away and returned too late. They
missed the commander and a chance for their on-camera interview.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud then invited the journalists to accompany him aboard his
helicopter back to Khodja Bahauddin, Masoud's isolated headquarters
on the Tajik border. The journalists packed camera and battery pack
for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   They were ready to depart when Masoud's bodyguards confronted
them.</TE>
<TE>   The rickety old Russian MI-17 was overloaded. They would have to
stay behind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Masoud may have inflamed animosities in spring 2001 when he
accepted an invitation to address the European Parliament in
Strasbourg, France, his first official trip to the West. Supporters
said it was part of a plan to transform his image from local military
hero to national opposition political leader--and to attract Western
support for the resistance.</TE>
<TE>   The high-profile visit caused friction within Masoud's alliance.
The old fundamentalist leaders such as Rabbani and Sayyaf were being
eclipsed by Masoud's rising international profile. Some Masoud
loyalists assert privately that seeds of betrayal might have sprung
from that April trip to France.</TE>
<TE>   French investigators believe that this is when the assassination
plot began as well. Evidence shows that fake documents for the
killers were prepared in the following weeks and that one of the
letters of introduction was composed on an IBM desktop computer,
later discovered in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   When Masoud held a news conference outside the European
Parliament, a reporter asked if he had a message for the White House.
According to published accounts, Masoud responded:</TE>
<TE>   "If President Bush doesn't help us, then these terrorists will
damage the United States and Europe very soon--and it will be too
late."</TE>
<TE>   The wife of one of Masoud's assassins later told European law
enforcement officials that Masoud's comments were taken as a threat
to the Taliban and Bin Laden supporters. In a recent book, she told
Belgian author-journalist Marie-Rose Armesto:</TE>
<TE>   Masoud "went to ask for help against us. He wanted weapons to kill
us. He had to be stopped."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The two journalists bumped from Masoud's helicopter ended up stuck
in Panjshir for several days. A second helicopter never arrived. Bad
weather.</TE>
<TE>   The number of near-misses was beginning to pile up--almost getting
into the shura, almost getting Masoud alone at the guesthouse, almost
getting aboard the resistance leader's helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the skies cleared. Another helicopter arrived to ferry
the men to Khodja Bahauddin. They were introduced as journalist
guests of Sayyaf.</TE>
<TE>   But, again, the promised interview was delayed. The
long-anticipated Taliban-Al Qaeda offensive had begun. Masoud was
preoccupied. The journalists had to wait.</TE>
<TE>   They were given a room next door to Gen. Mohammed Arif. They were
neighbors of Masoud's chief of internal security.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1999, European investigators detected increased Al
Qaeda recruiting among Tunisian emigres in the West.</TE>
<TE>   By fall 2000, Abdelsattar Dahmane, 39--a Tunisian residing in
Belgium--was one of the scores of Arab and North African Muslims from
Europe studying terrorism in one of Al Qaeda's Afghan camps. He lived
in a house near the camps with his Moroccan wife, Malika, surrounded
by elite Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime in spring or early summer 2001, Dahmane was selected for
a suicide mission. He had studied journalism in Tunisia and Belgium
and would pose as a television interviewer. His faux cameraman would
be another Tunisian, Rachid Bourawi Alwaer--an illegal immigrant to
Belgium who worked odd jobs in construction.</TE>
<TE>   European investigators tracking the histories of Masoud's killers
found that Dahmane had been active in Brussels and London with the
Tunisian Fighting Group, a terrorist affiliate of Al Qaeda.
Authorities believe that the contract to kill Masoud was a classic
exchange of services. The Tunisian Fighting Group wanted its recruits
trained in Afghan terrorist camps and agreed to take on the Masoud
hit "to pay the rent," officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tunisians have attained a high level of operational importance
and influence" within Al Qaeda, said a French law enforcement
official, particularly since Sept. 11. They have been active in
recent plots to bomb American embassies in Paris and Rome,
investigative documents also show.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, security officers said that Masoud had been a
target of assassination attempts by Bin Laden and the Taliban for
more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Previous plans to blow up his helicopter were thwarted. The
Taliban once called in an airstrike on Masoud's office. In 2000,
security officials intercepted three infiltrators carrying powerful
C-4 plastic explosives. Masoud's security chief said people working
close to the resistance leader had been paid to sabotage him.</TE>
<TE>   "Osama was actively trying to recruit spies inside the Panjshir
Valley," said Arif, now head of intelligence for the interim Afghan
government.</TE>
<TE>   But no one saw the Tunisians coming. Their identities were buried
in stolen passports, false Pakistani visas and misleading letters of
introduction--a plot with Bin Laden's personal fingerprints all over
it, according to Arif and European investigators.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The journalists wandered through the village of Khodja Bahauddin,
killing time awaiting their audience with Masoud. Days passed.</TE>
<TE>   They became familiar figures to Masoud's bodyguards, made up of
his elite commando troops. The guards were never alerted to any
special threats.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud's younger brother, Ahmad Wali, would later report that "a
source in Pakistan" warned him about Al Qaeda sending killers
"disguised as journalists." He says he passed it along.</TE>
<TE>   But reports of assassination intrigues were common. So were
foreign journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "They had lots of plans to kill Commander Masoud. Which report was
good?" said Arif, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Arif would later claim that he too was growing
suspicious. He says he even tried to stop the interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Commander Masoud, 'Please don't meet these two Arabs. Let
me arrest them.' "</TE>
<TE>   By Arif's account, Masoud thought about it for two minutes, then
said:</TE>
<TE>   "Forget it. These people are just journalists."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of a renewed Taliban attack Saturday evening, Sept.
8, caught alliance forces by surprise. Gen. Bismillah Khan feared
that his troops might not survive to daylight. At the height of
battle, he called Masoud by satellite phone.</TE>
<TE>   Bismillah Khan--a stocky, blue-eyed, workaholic warlord--had
fought alongside Masoud for 22 years. He was especially distressed to
advise his friend and commander that a Taliban breakthrough seemed
imminent. A Masoud aide later said Bismillah Khan was near panic that
night.</TE>
<TE>   Over the phone, Masoud offered encouragement and cool advice on
troop deployments. Later, Masoud retired to his quarters with a
visiting friend--Masood Khalili, the Northern Alliance's ambassador
to India. The two men sat cross-legged on floor cushions "talking
about many things--poetry, politics, the situation in Afghanistan,"
recalled Khalili.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud had an ornately bound volume of the works of 14th century
Persian Sufi poet Hafiz. He asked Khalili to recite over and over
again a favorite verse about friends sitting, talking, enjoying a
night like many nights to come, though this night "will never be
repeated."</TE>
<TE>   The two friends gazed out at the village of Khodja Bahauddin, the
stars, the Amu Darya River--until about 4 a.m. Masoud was barely
asleep when his personal secretary delivered news that Bismillah
Khan's front line had held.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud made his morning prayer, then slept until daylight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The two journalists learned early the morning of Sept. 9 that
finally they would have their audience with Masoud. It was a sunny
day in Khodja Bahauddin as they prepared their equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The interview would be conducted next door, in the bungalow of
security chief Arif.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, though the two Arab men had lived among Masoud's
closest and most cautious advisors for more than 20 days, no one knew
their real names, ethnic origins or ominous associations.</TE>
<TE>   Affable Touzani was really Dahmane, whose wife still lived with
the families of other Al Qaeda agents near Jalalabad. Bakkali was
really Alwaer, the taciturn construction worker from Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   The cameraman strapped on his battery pack. He cinched it around
his waist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Over his usual breakfast of tea with bread, cheese, almonds and
cream, Masoud received more encouraging reports from his field
commanders. He was eager to meet the journalists, to make his case
that the Taliban was relying on foreigners--Pakistanis and Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud made a radio call to Bismillah Khan at the front in Jabal
os Saraj. He asked the general's communications officer if they
"could send up some bodies of dead Arabs by helicopter to show the
journalists."</TE>
<TE>   At Arif's bungalow, Masoud was on the phone again when an aide
escorted the journalists into the room. Holding the phone to his ear
with one hand, Masoud reached out to shake hands.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the two he still knew as the Moroccans, a third
journalist joined them. Fahim Dashty, a Panjshiri, was producing a
documentary on the guerrilla hero. He set up his own camera and audio
gear in the back of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud apologized that this day had been so long in coming.
Dahmane and Alwaer said they were pleased to meet the legendary
leader. They presented their letters of introduction from the Islamic
Observation Center in London and its Arabic News International
affiliate--the letters ending with: "May Allah reward you" for any
cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Before the questioning began, Masoud asked Arif to try again to
get Bismillah Khan, still hoping to fly some Arab bodies to his camp.</TE>
<TE>   Under any circumstance, such a request would have been difficult.
Masoud commanders said one of their fellow officers had set up a
lucrative trade in selling bodies back to the enemy. It helped
finance their war effort. And Arabs, the commanders said in
interviews, fetched higher prices than the Talibs because Bin Laden
was willing to pay dearly for the corpses of his men.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud sat in a large stuffed chair. Smiling, he slipped off his
trademark pakul, a sort of Afghan beret, and ordered green tea for
everyone. They made small talk. What had the men found coming through
Taliban territory?</TE>
<TE>   The people are unhappy, Dahmane responded, chatting easily. Arab
and Pakistani military men roam Kabul. Omar refused them an interview
because television "is haram"--forbidden under Islamic law. And
Taliban ministers were not forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud was amused.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw for the last time Mr. Masoud's smile," said Ahmad Jamshid,
Masoud's personal secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Cameraman Alwaer calmly set up his equipment in the middle of the
room. He seemed impassive, uninvolved with the conversation around
him. He adjusted his tripod, set to its lowest level so the camera
lens was chest-high opposite Masoud. He asked to remove a small table
between them.</TE>
<TE>   Ambassador Khalili, seated on a couch to Masoud's right to help
translate, recalled trying to loosen up the commander before the
questions started.</TE>
<TE>   "The cameraman was quite burly," Khalili said, "and to get the
commander in the mood for the interview, I quipped in Persian, 'Is he
a wrestler or a photographer?' "</TE>
<TE>   Masoud asked to see the interview questions--a list that Khalili
then translated for the commander from English into Persian. With
that, the Lion of Panjshir turned to the camera and said: "You can
start filming now."</TE>
<TE>   Jamshid, the secretary, stepped out of the room to avoid being in
the frame. Dashty, the documentary maker, still was adjusting his
camera, trying to compensate for back-lighting from a window behind
Masoud.</TE>
<TE>   Dahmane started to ask the first question. Alwaer switched on the
camera.</TE>
<TE>   Khalili said "blue, thick fire" rushed at him--and he heard a
"poof." His teeth clenched.</TE>
<TE>   He said he heard a voice inside telling him that this was his
final moment. "Then I started screaming, 'God is great!' " And he
lost consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Dashty jumped in surprise at the flash of light, thinking that his
camera had malfunctioned. "Then I felt a burning all over my hands,
legs and face. I rushed out of the room," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jamshid ran up, wide-eyed. What happened to Commander Masoud? he
gasped.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Dashty looked back at the room for the first time. He
saw fire, smoke, dust, smashed windows, broken furniture. The room
was destroyed. He smelled gunpowder.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb in the battery pack had blown the body of cameraman
Alwaer in half. But Dahmane had only minor cuts from flying glass. He
tried to run from the scene, muttering that he didn't know what
happened. Security officers locked him in a room. When he escaped
through a window, he was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Haji Mohammad Omar, Masoud's bodyguard for 12 years, rushed
inside. Everything was on fire. He found Masoud still seated in the
armchair, surrounded by devastation, his face and body covered in
blood.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud whispered: "Pick me up."</TE>
<TE>   At Jabal os Saraj, the resistance fighters of Bismillah Khan had
prepared a large meal for Masoud and his entourage. They were
expected for lunch after the interview. No one arrived. No one called
to explain. The general picked up his satellite phone and called
Khodja Bahauddin. No one answered.</TE>
<TE>   At Masoud's camp, it was a four-minute drive from the bungalow to
the airstrip. Omar, the bodyguard, held Masoud in the backseat, the
commander's head on his lap. He was still breathing as they bounced
toward the helicopter pad, but blood poured from his thigh. And as
they pulled up to the aircraft, the bodyguard knew that it was
hopeless.</TE>
<TE>   "Amir Sahib had stopped breathing," he said, a familiar reference
to "the big boss."</TE>
<TE>   Ambassador Khalili faded in and out of consciousness. Once
airborne, he revived briefly, he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw my commander's face and thought to myself, 'He's dying and
I'm dying.' "</TE>
<TE>   The injured Dashty remembered that "everyone was quiet." The only
sound was the helicopter rotors.</TE>
<TE>   They reached a Tajikistan medical clinic within 10 minutes. Masoud
needed no medical treatment. Two pieces of shrapnel had pierced his
heart. His body was moved to an operating room and laid on a table,
covered with a sheet of white paper.</TE>
<TE>   Jamshid called the inner circle of advisors to the clinic, telling
them that Masoud was slightly injured. One by one they arrived,
waiting outside the operating room. A doctor appeared. "It's too
late," he said. "We can't do anything. He's already martyred."</TE>
<TE>   Jamshid fainted. He awoke later with IVs in his arms, surrounded
by doctors. Another young Masoud assistant arrived to find the bloody
white paper sheet draped over the body on the operating table. In a
fury, he tore away the sheet and burst into tears.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the lowest point in the history of our movement," said
one resistance official. "We felt lost."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there were seven aides gathered at the clinic. They
agreed to a pact of secrecy and lies.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest fear was that once news of Masoud's death was known,
their troops would lose heart and Taliban troops would quickly
overrun them.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed time," said a member of that group. "Masoud was head of
a cause. He was heading a nation. We did not want that cause, that
nation, to collapse--so, we had to lie."</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Mohammed Qassim Fahim was picked to succeed the fallen
leader. Today, he is defense minister of the interim government and
one of the most powerful political figures in the country. That
afternoon, he was a reluctant successor, accepting only after the
others insisted.</TE>
<TE>   When night fell, Masoud's body was spirited to a nearby town. It
was hidden in a refrigerated vault at the local morgue.</TE>
<TE>   Back out on the battlefields in Takhar province and in the
Panjshir Valley, Taliban and Al Qaeda forces unleashed wave after
wave of new assaults. Three heavy offensives were repulsed Sept. 9 to
11.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Ghani, who was commanding the forces holding the front
line north of Kabul, said many of his troops were killed or wounded.
"They expected to sweep through our lines," he said. "They thought
this would be the final battle for Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors that Masoud was dead swept the Taliban side of the front.
In lulls between battles, the fighters used satellite phones and
walkie-talkies to call their resistance counterparts to taunt and
threaten. Despite the battlefield standoff, their messages brimmed
with confidence.</TE>
<TE>   They demanded: Surrender or die.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Masoud's body still was refrigerated, his death still
unconfirmed. Fighters of the Northern Alliance still clung to their
defensive positions--from the Panjshir to the Tajik border. But the
rest of the world had changed.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Sept. 11, leaders of the resistance began to
realize that they might have a new ally in a vengeful United States.
And the Taliban fighters must have realized the same. They acted
confused. Their offensive abruptly stopped. Their forces dug into
defensive positions.</TE>
<TE>   In the days that followed, the messages over Taliban satellite
phones and walkie-talkies changed too. Taliban commanders started
calling on their resistance counterparts to unite against the threat
of foreign invasion.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after Sept. 11, in the skies over the Panjshir Valley,
a dark green helicopter appeared out of the north.</TE>
<TE>   The MI-17 had a familiar look. It was the same aircraft making up
that pathetic little Northern Alliance fleet. But this one was
new--freshly painted, a handsome machine.</TE>
<TE>   Observed a wistful alliance official at the sight: "We never
managed to acquire even one new helicopter from the Americans to take
Commander Masoud back and forth."</TE>
<TE>   The Russian helicopter landed outside a compound where alliance
leaders waited. It carried CIA officers with a proposal.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Masoud had urged the U.S. to take on the Taliban in
order to stop Bin Laden. Now, the U.S. was seeking alliance help to
take on the Taliban in order to stop Bin Laden. For years, Masoud had
thrown his forces against the Taliban, vainly asking the West for
guns, money and supplies. Now, the U.S. promised guns, money and
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the CIA team said he was disappointed at having missed
so many previous opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   For the alliance, there remained internal rivalries and lingering
concerns about a pact with foreigners. "For us this was a whole new
thing," acknowledged an Afghan official close to the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   But in a matter of days, the resistance had gone from the brink of
collapse to rejuvenation. It was as if "suddenly something fell out
of the sky," said alliance leaders. In the secret meeting, Fahim,
Arif and Abdullah agreed to full cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Masoud's body had been moved from its secret refrigerated
vault. Today, he is buried on an Afghan mountaintop.</TE>

Drogin, Doyle McManus and Robin Wright in Washington; and Times

<DH>War: A suspected Al Qaeda training camp is among sites.
Searchers also blow up caves.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. troops searched a suspected Al Qaeda training camp and blew up
caves where weapons were found in southeastern Afghanistan, a U.S.
military spokesman said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers discovered a stash of munitions and weapons,
including four boxes of heavy machine-gun ammunition and three
rocket-propelled grenades, Col. Roger King told reporters at Bagram
air base north of Kabul, the Afghan capital.</LD>
<LD>   No documents were found in the caves or at the suspected training
site near Suleiman Khel, about 10 miles from the Pakistani border,
during the Monday search, King said. Several caves were then sealed
using explosives, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The troops returned to the U.S. base at the southern city of
Kandahar on Tuesday after the operation, carried out amid
temperatures of more than 120 degrees. U.S. officials have said there
are a number of suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban sites near the
Pakistani border that they are searching for intelligence or weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Most Al Qaeda or Taliban fighters are thought to have either taken
refuge in neighboring Pakistan or gone into hiding in small numbers
in eastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 U.S. troops, mostly Special Forces, searching in the
border region for months have found weapons caches but few fighters.</TE>
<TE>   King said the new finds did not necessarily suggest that
additional terrorists or Taliban members were in the area. The
weapons could have been "placed there a while ago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, France announced that it will pull back its aircraft
carrier Charles de Gaulle and nuclear submarine Saphir from the
Arabian Sea after the Afghan loya jirga tribal assembly, now underway
in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Two French frigates will remain in the region, and France will
keep about 500 soldiers in an international peacekeeping force in
Kabul for an additional six months, the government said.</TE>

<DL>PROKUPLJE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>A former Yugoslav soldier went on trial Tuesday on charges of killing
two ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, in the first war crimes case to be
tried in a Yugoslav court.</LD>
<LD>   Ivan Nikolic, 30, is charged with gunning down the two civilians
in the village of Peduh in May 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The district court in Prokuplje, a Serbian town near Kosovo
province, charged Nikolic with murder last year. This year, his
indictment was changed to "war crimes against the civilian
population."</LD>
<TE>   The current authorities, who ousted Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in October 2000, are eager to start war crimes trials in
domestic courts.</TE>
<TE>   They hope to ease international pressure on them to extradite
suspects to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   The new authorities have reluctantly handed over several Serbian
suspects to the U.N. tribunal, including Milosevic.</TE>

<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe</DL>
<LD>A U.S. journalist accused of publishing a false story was scheduled
to go on trial today in a test of Zimbabwe's tough new media law.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Meldrum, the Zimbabwe correspondent for Britain's Guardian
newspaper, would be the first to go on trial on charges of publishing
falsehoods, a crime that carries a heavy fine or a two-year jail
term.</LD>
<LD>   Meldrum, 50, from Hudson, Ohio, is charged over a story alleging
that supporters of President Robert Mugabe beheaded a female
opposition activist in a rural district while her two young children
watched.</LD>
<TE>   The story was published by Zimbabwe's privately owned Daily News,
which later said that the story was false and apologized.</TE>

<HD>Net Music That's a Steal--but Not Stolen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acknowledging that online piracy is forcing dramatic changes in the
music industry, the world's two largest record companies are poised
to make it easy and cheap for fans to buy--rather than steal--songs
off the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The moves by Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment
accelerate the industry's transition to an era in which music is
distributed electronically. Other major labels are likely to follow
as the record business grapples with the rise of online music copying
through unauthorized services such as Napster, Kazaa and Morpheus and
potentially billions of dollars in lost sales.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than trying to force consumers to buy music on the labels'
terms, the services signal that record companies are slowly adapting
to Internet-fueled changes in the marketplace.</LD>
<TE>   This summer, Universal plans to sell tens of thousands of
high-quality digital singles for 99 cents or less and albums for
$9.99 through online retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy and Sam
Goody, according to sources and company executives. Universal plans
to make new releases available for downloading as well as older ones,
and possibly offer downloads before the music is available on CD.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, the company plans to let consumers download songs
and record them freely onto CDs --a major shift from the company's
practice of limiting what users could do with downloaded music.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether consumers accustomed to getting music for
free will pay even 99 cents. Executives hope that, at some point,
consumers will elect to pay a modest fee rather than steal.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty-nine cents seems like the appropriate amount," said Ron
Stone, president of Gold Mountain Entertainment, an artist management
firm. "If you can get kids to spend 49 cents, consider it a gift.
Make it 99 cents, you won't sell any, particularly if the singles
market is a kids market."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers have flocked to digital formats that let them build
custom collections and transfer music freely between their computer,
portable players and CDs. But most of the music industry services
offer relatively small selections and restrict how the music is used.
As a result, they are considerably less popular than free pirate
services.</TE>
<TE>   The new services suggest that Universal and Sony no longer will
handicap their online music business for fear of eating into CD
sales, which have been the industry's lifeblood. Billions of song
files have been copied for free through the Net, and consumers have
no legitimate source for the vast majority of those songs.</TE>
<TE>   Sony also has quietly changed its policy on downloads to allow CD
burning--a change that should go into effect any day, according to
company executives. That is expected to increase the number of
downloadable songs dramatically this summer, and a spokeswoman said
prices would drop to $1.49 a song as soon as Sony's vendors could
make the change.</TE>
<TE>   Although some music retailers and analysts applauded the moves
Tuesday, they said it would be a challenge to wean consumers from the
steady diet of free downloads they have enjoyed for more than two
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the consumers ultimately are going to decide if it's too
late to come back to the market," said Matt Durgin, director of
retail merchandising for BeMusic, a Bertelsmann unit that owns online
music retailer CDNow. "The only thing you can do is put the product
out there ... and hopefully the consumers will come back."</TE>
<TE>   The efforts by Universal and Sony mark a reversal on three key
issues for the record industry.</TE>
<TE>   By discounting the songs, the labels acknowledge that music
delivered through the Net should be sold for less than a packaged
good. By allowing the songs to be recorded on CD, they are
sacrificing security for the sake of consumer acceptance. And by
working through independent retailers, they are relinquishing some
control over online music distribution.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the downloadable songs will compete with the subscription
music service from Pressplay, a fledgling joint venture by Universal
and Sony.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Horovitz, president of the National Assn. of Recording
Merchandisers, praised the Universal initiative as "a great first
step in the right direction" because it provides a legitimate source
of singles at entry-level prices. The association has criticized the
labels for abandoning the singles market, leaving consumers no
alternative to the unauthorized free services.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Kenswil, president of Universal ELabs, the record
company's new-media arm, said Universal planned to offer downloadable
versions of every song to which it holds the digital rights. That's
tens of thousands of tracks from a total of 10,000 to 11,000 albums.</TE>
<TE>   The songs will be distributed first by Liquid Audio of Redwood
City, Calif., whose audio format provides better sound quality than
MP3 files. Liquid Audio delivers music to dozens of online retailers,
including CDNow, Amazon.com, Best Buy and Sam Goody.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid Audio files are scrambled so they can't be freely copied
from computer to computer. But Universal has decided to let buyers
burn the files onto conventional CDs in unscrambled formats, meaning
they could be copied or moved freely from that point.</TE>
<TE>   The major labels have resisted the idea of letting consumers burn
downloadable songs because they believe it would encourage piracy.
But Kenswil noted that songs are widely being pirated, so "you're not
keeping anything from being open [to piracy] by copy-protecting the
download."</TE>
<TE>   The Liquid Audio files are designed to help labels enforce their
copyrights, though, by helping them trace the source of pirated
copies.</TE>
<TE>   The downloads contain watermarks that are designed to stay with
any digital copies made of the song, enabling authorities to identify
the original buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Sony initially offered downloadable singles only through its Web
site, using a special player, and with stiff restrictions on copying.
The company cut the price to about $2, and it expanded availability
by striking a deal with online distributor RioPort Inc. of San Jose,
whose partners include MTV.com and Best Buy.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Long, chief executive of RioPort, said, "I expect to have
70,000 to 100,000 total downloads for sale before the end of the
year."</TE>
<TE>   One key to success, he said, is removing the restriction on
recording songs onto CDs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to sell downloads, they've got to be burnable.... You
can't change the way people use music. You try to do that, sales will
plummet."</TE>

<HD>Bishops Confront Pressure to Give More Power to Laity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER and TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For six months, apologetic Roman Catholic bishops have been
describing the church's sexual abuse crisis in near-apocalyptic terms
as "a time of purification."</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops prepares to
convene Thursday in Dallas for the first time since the scandal
erupted, the bishops face a day of judgment.</LD>
<LD>   The immediate decision before them is whether to approve an
unprecedented policy that would cast a cleric out of the priesthood
forever if he sexually abused minors, with a narrow but highly
controversial exception for a one-time past offense.</LD>
<TE>   Yet far more is at stake. The sex scandal is not simply about sex,
but a more fundamental issue: control. A growing number of Catholic
scholars and lay members are concluding that the scandal happened
because of a lack of rank-and-file participation in the church. They
are suggesting that the church's all-powerful bishops and priests
share authority with the laity, as is the case in many other
Christian denominations. Ideas such as letting parish members make
decisions on how contributions are spent and how priests are hired
are spreading.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of accountability will be the real subtext at the Dallas
meeting, which will draw nearly 300 bishops from the 194 American
dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   There are efforts underway for victims of priestly abuse to
address the bishops. But by and large, the bishops are expected to
limit their debate to the immediate issue of sexual abuse policy.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Dallas Fairmont Hotel, however, the conference might
more closely resemble the convention of a troubled political party
searching for its soul.</TE>
<TE>   A large number of Catholic and victims-rights organizations,
picket signs in hand, see the conference as a rare chance for
visibility. They include liberals who want to see married and women
priests, conservatives who want to purge the priesthood of
homosexuals and activists who demand a church that is far more
participatory. The bishops conference has issued about 700 press
credentials--a sharp increase from the 100 or so usually handed out
to reporters who attend the twice-a-year gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   Many say the sexual abuse scandal has awakened rank-and-file
Catholics not only to the moral double standard of some bishops, but
to the laity's own powerlessness to effect change. That combination
puts tremendous pressure on bishops to act decisively.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the bishops who have scandalized the church," said M.
Therese Lysaught, an expert in theological ethics and associate
professor of religious studies at the University of Dayton, a
Catholic institution in Ohio. "Laypeople and the U.S. public have
known for 20 years that priests have abused minors. It was not until
the role of the bishops was revealed that people became morally
outraged."</TE>
<TE>   Since January, almost every week has brought new allegations of
priests having sexually abused minors, along with more troubling
reports that some bishops allowed them to minister and molest after
they were informed of the problem. At least 225 of the nation's
46,000 Catholic priests have either quit or been forced to resign
following recent allegations that they sexually abused children. Some
bishops have admitted that in years past they, too, molested minors.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal has angered and embarrassed Catholic laypeople as well
as the vast majority of good priests, and led Pope John Paul II in
April to summon U.S. cardinals to Rome for an extraordinary
conference on the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Bishops are poised to enact the toughest policy against sexual
abuse since they first took up the issue at a closed meeting in 1985.
Since then, there have been additional steps, all of them
incremental--ranging from a public acknowledgment of the problem in
1988 to winning Vatican approval in 1994 for extending the church's
own statute of limitations for bringing charges against abusive
priests.</TE>
<TE>   The flare-up of the scandal again this year forced bishops to
respond with uncharacteristic speed. Last week, their ad hoc sexual
abuse committee unveiled a compact that calls for safeguards that
would far eclipse anything the American church has ever attempted.</TE>
<TE>   The key proposal: If a priest were to commit even one act of
sexual abuse of a minor in the future, his bishop would move to
defrock him. The final decision in this process, known as
"laicization," would be up to the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   But in a move certain to provoke debate, the committee created a
narrow exception to this so-called "zero-tolerance" policy, intended
to cover "good" priests with a lone flaw in their past: If a priest
committed only a single act of sexual abuse against a single child
before the new rules took effect, and had undergone psychological
treatment that determined he was not a pedophile, he could minister
again.</TE>
<TE>   This priest would have to be assigned to a ministry that did not
involve minors, and would need a favorable recommendation from a
lay-dominated sexual abuse review committee in his diocese. The
committee would have to hear testimony from both the priest and his
victim. Finally, if the priest were granted a new ministry, those to
whom he ministered would be fully informed of his record in advance.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals before the bishops this week include creating a
national Office of Child and Youth Protection, headquartered in
Washington, D.C., to assist the dioceses in creating or improving
sexual abuse prevention policies. The new office would issue annual
public reports tracking bishops' compliance with the standards.</TE>
<TE>   Bishops are expected to overwhelmingly approve the new proposal,
although final details await amendments and floor debate before the
showdown vote.</TE>
<TE>   There have been mixed signals from Rome about whether the Vatican
will approve any changes in canon law to put some of the reforms into
effect. Some influential figures in Rome have called the American
approach too harsh. Given the depth of public outrage, however, the
exception to the "zero-tolerance" proposal--some disparage it as "two
strikes and you're out"--might not survive a floor vote.</TE>
<TE>   Some bishops who have given a molesting priest another chance
after psychological treatment have lived to rue the day--among them
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, like Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston and other bishops, has
come under severe criticism for transferring priests in past years to
new assignments after being informed that they had sexually abused
minors. Embarrassed by adverse publicity as well as millions of
dollars in settlements, Mahony said he has drafted amendments to the
ad hoc committee's proposal that would strike down any exception.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many dioceses have come to learn later on that there is no
guarantee that a cleric has 'successfully undergone treatment' for
the abuse of minors," Mahony's proposed amendment states. "No one can
guarantee that there has been only one act of the sexual abuse of a
minor. There is recidivism among clerics who have abused minors, and
the church cannot risk its children and young people to such a
possibility."</TE>
<TE>   As a practical matter, there may be very few priests who have
committed only a single act of sexual abuse, Father Tom Reese, editor
of the Jesuit magazine America said in an interview. But media
exposure, lawsuits and pressure from outraged parishioners have
created a symbolic importance easily grasped by bishops, who at times
must be as much politico as pastor.</TE>
<TE>   "If the bishops don't handle this moment very well, they're going
to find an increasingly vociferous demand for wider involvement [by
the laity]," said Paul Lakeland, a professor of religious studies at
Fairfield University, a Jesuit institution in Connecticut, who is an
expert on the role of the laity. "What's become apparent is, the
structure is in some serious ways dysfunctional."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the outrage, said Dayton professor Lysaught, "comes from
what is perceived to be a double standard. There is a sense among
laypeople that if you commit certain kinds of sin you can be
effectively excommunicated. Now we find there have been priests
engaging in sins of much greater gravity who were protected, who
weren't excommunicated, who kept their jobs--and were allowed to
celebrate the Eucharist!"</TE>
<TE>   Father Peter Phan, president of the Catholic Theological Society
of America, said it is time for bishops to grapple with how to
empower the laity--for example, by transforming parish councils into
"venues for true lay influence and decision-making." Among their
interests, he said, is parish financial spending priorities.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, 14 unofficial Catholic reform groups, at least half of
them backers of women's issues, announced that during the conference
they will demand far greater lay involvement in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our children, our faith and our resources that are at
stake," they said in a joint statement.</TE>
<TE>   Signatories include Catholics for a Free Choice; Celibacy Is the
Issue; Women's Ordination Conference; Dignity/USA, a gay and lesbian
group; and CORPUS, the National Assn. for an Inclusive Priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   In reacting to such demands, the bishops are following a practice
steeped in the history of governance: When radical change threatens,
widen the power base. A number of the bishops have already placed lay
members in the majority on their local sexual abuse advisory
committees. And the draft compact pays brief homage to the laity by
saying: "We do wish to affirm our concern especially with regard to
issues related to effective consultation of the laity and the
participation of God's people in decision-making that affects their
well-being."</TE>
<TE>   Some observers suggest the resignation of bishops who mishandled
the crisis by protecting errant priests. Lysaught said such bishops
should declare, "I was shepherd and I let the wolf into the sheepfold
and I didn't do anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of reaction flows predictably from veteran church
watchers. The real evidence of grass-roots ferment is found in the
heartfelt observations of everyday Catholics like Fran Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   "I really love the church," said Ruth, a graduate student at the
Jesuit-owned Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As she searches for a resolution to the church's wounds, she
offers this suggestion: All Catholics would write down their
grievances on slips of paper and place them in a bowl, where they
would be burned. The ashes would be imposed on the foreheads of the
faithful--and the bishops--on Ash Wednesday, the beginning of the
Christian penitential season of Lent.</TE>
<TE>   "What I want [the bishops] to truly do is to recognize they are
responsible, just as responsible as the perpetrators, for all of
what's going on in this scandal," Ruth said. "This is a pivotal point
in church history. It's time to open the doors to all the
baptized--meaning the laypeople. We're all 'priests,' and we should
be seen as equal, regardless of sex or marital status."</TE>

<HD>Monastery Mourns Gunman's Victims; Questions Persist</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: Inquiries reveal no clue to why the gunman shot
four monks, killing two.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CONCEPTION, Mo.</DL>
<LD>A monk in black robes tolled the chapel bell 51 times Tuesday
morning. There was a pause. Conception Abbey was quiet under thick
thunderclouds. The monk resumed pulling. The bell tolled 32. It began
to rain.</LD>
<LD>   Workers scrubbed bloodstains from the polished wooden floor.</LD>
<LD>   A day after an elderly loner walked through the Roman Catholic
monastery shooting a replica AK-47, there was ritual, there was
mourning, there was prayer.</LD>
<TE>   But there were very few answers.</TE>
<TE>   As the bells tolled in memory of two slain monks, investigators
could come up with only sparse clues about the gunman. Lloyd
Jeffress, 71, had also wounded two other monks with the assault rifle
before turning a second gun on himself.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities knew from his estranged daughter, who had seen him
just once in the last 40 years, that Jeffress was a devout Catholic
as a boy. They knew he had attended several Methodist services in the
last year while living in a senior citizen complex in Kearney, Mo.,
an hour's drive away.</TE>
<TE>   They found a card in Jeffress' wallet detailing years of Army
service, including his bronze star earned in Korea. They tracked down
his employment history: a steel factory, a post office. In his
austere, barely decorated apartment, they found medication for
depression. And the deed to a prepaid burial, purchased in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The picture that emerged was suggestive but patchy. Too patchy to
satisfy a community in shock.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's asking the same thing: Why did he do it?" said Sgt.
Sheldon Lyon of the Missouri Highway Patrol. "It would be easy to
answer that, normally. But this guy was so private."</TE>
<TE>   Checking Jeffress' name against a database of 20,000 people linked
to the monastery--including donors, pilgrims, employees, and seminary
students and their relatives--Abbey staff could find no connection
between the gunman and the Benedictine community he targeted.</TE>
<TE>   They were still scouring old visitor logs to see whether Jeffress
might have made a private pilgrimage to the abbey without being noted
in the computerized database. But those familiar with the records
said that seemed unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "We have absolutely no connection with this man," said Abbot
Gregory Polan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complete mystery," added Dan Madden, the monastery's
communication director.</TE>
<TE>   Polan said it was possible the gunman might have lashed out
against the monastery in outrage at the sexual abuse scandal roiling
the Roman Catholic Church. But Jeffress left no note suggesting such
a motive. And witnesses said he made no statements as he stalked the
abbey.</TE>
<TE>   The only words anyone in the monastery heard as the horrible
minutes ticked by came from Brother Damian Larson, who groaned "no,
no" as he lay bleeding on the floor. Jeffress returned and shot him
twice more. He then shot Father Philip Schuster in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Funerals for both monks are scheduled for Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep thinking there will be answers," Madden said. "We'd like
to know so we can put some sense to it."</TE>
<TE>   Through the fog of uncertainty and the fatigue of grief, the 30
monks living at Conception Abbey tried their best to return to
routine.</TE>
<TE>   There was some good news to buoy them: The two monks gravely
wounded in the rampage, Fathers Kenneth Reichert and Norbert
Schappler, had pulled through surgeries and were listed in stable
condition.</TE>
<TE>   And there was routine to comfort them: They were able to ring the
chapel bell at 8:35 a.m., exactly 24 hours after the violence
shattered their peace.</TE>
<TE>   The bell normally tolls within minutes of a monk's death. But in
the chaos of the carnage Monday, that was impossible. So Abbot Polan
ordered the bell rung a day late.</TE>
<TE>   The first set of peals honored Schuster's 51 years of service with
the Benedictine community. The second set memorialized Larson's 32
years at the abbey.</TE>
<TE>   As the last echo died, Abbot Polan put his hand to his heart.</TE>

<HD>Pilot Errors Cited in 2001 Aspen Crash</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Report points to 'numerous' mistakes in landing of
the charter jet in which 18 were killed last year. Improved training
of crews urged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The pilots of a charter jet from Los Angeles that crashed last year
in Aspen, Colo., made "numerous" errors as they rushed to make an
instrument landing at dusk in snowy weather, federal investigators
concluded Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board's final report on the
March 29 crash that killed 18 people also called for improved
training of charter crews on the management of complex, rapidly
evolving situations. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, charters
have become increasingly popular with well-heeled travelers who want
to avoid airlines and the long security lines at airports.</LD>
<LD>   Dealing with the spreading darkness, swirling snow showers and
looming slopes, the pilots of the jet that crashed also had other
pressures that evening, NTSB investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   The flight had left Los Angeles International Airport about 40
minutes late, and Robert Frisbie, the pilot in command, and co-pilot
Peter Kowalczyk knew that they would only have one try to land before
an Aspen airport curfew took effect.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers who had hired the jet for a ski weekend were
adamant about landing at the town's airport. The plane's cockpit
recorder picked up the voice of an unidentified male passenger in the
cockpit jump seat, and NTSB investigators said his questions added to
the pressures on the captain.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, if they made a missed approach, they would not have been
able to land at Aspen that night," said NTSB chair Marion Blakey.</TE>
<TE>   Frisbie was at the controls as the plane began its final approach.
The voice recorder showed that he and Kowalczyk skipped over required
pre-landing discussions that would have covered such topics as what
to do if they couldn't see the runway and had to go around.</TE>
<TE>   It was the beginning of a series of mistakes that would quickly
prove fatal.</TE>
<TE>   "The captain felt ... that he would get below whatever low clouds
were in the area and would have no difficulty finding the airport,"
said NTSB investigator Dave Kirchgessner. "If they had made a
go-around ... we would not be sitting here talking about it today."</TE>
<TE>   The plane came in too steeply, according to the radar data. At
10,200 feet, it crossed an imaginary line--the "minimum descent
altitude"--above the Aspen airport. Pilots making an instrument
approach to Aspen are not supposed to go below that line unless they
can see the runway. The line is there to keep planes well above any
obstacle in the mountainous region.</TE>
<TE>   But at 8,400 feet, Frisbie was still not sure if he could see the
runway. "Where's it at?" he asked Kowalczyk. To the right, came the
answer. But the runway was actually to the left. It's not clear what
Kowalczyk saw, but it may have been a road near the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "For an experienced crew, there were a number of surprising
issues," said Kirchgessner. "What I feel happened is that the captain
was very fixated on making a visual approach."</TE>
<TE>   At the last moment, the plane made a steep banking turn to the
left in an effort to get back on course, but it was too late. The
plane crashed into sloping terrain about 2,400 feet short of the
runway and exploded in a fireball.</TE>
<TE>   The twin-engine Gulfstream III was operated by Avjet Corp. of
Burbank. Ken Seals, the company's director of operations, said
Tuesday that he did not dispute the NTSB findings.</TE>
<TE>   Avjet has changed its landing procedures to require pilots to
discuss the risk of crashing into terrain, Seals said. The firm has
also taken steps to prevent pilots from being distracted by
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The plane had been chartered by Robert Neu, a financier connected
to the entertainment industry. Aboard were 14 of his friends. A
flight attendant was the third member of the crew.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Les Dorr said the agency
would take a close look at the NTSB recommendation for improved
training of charter crews. The simulator-based training would teach
techniques routinely used by airline crews to ensure attention to
detail and effective communication.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB also criticized the FAA over the handling and wording of
a safety directive issued two days before the crash, citing it as a
contributing factor.</TE>
<TE>   That directive prohibited nighttime instrument landings at Aspen.
The Avjet plane was trying to land a few minutes after the official
nightfall, 6:58.</TE>
<TE>   The safety advisory never reached FAA flight controllers at the
Aspen tower because the agency's regional center in Denver did not
forward it to them.</TE>
<TE>   The Avjet pilots were aware of the restriction, the NTSB said. But
it may not have been worded explicitly enough to register. It
referred to a "circling" approach, a type of instrument landing.</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The head of the Southern Baptists condemned homosexuality from the
podium Tuesday as gay rights protesters shouting slogans marched
through the convention hall and into the arms of police.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve protesters were arrested inside the hall, and 38 more were
taken into custody outside, where riot police stood near the main
doorway.</LD>
<LD>   The protesters who infiltrated the annual meeting of the nation's
largest Protestant denomination were charged with intimidation and
trespassing.</LD>
<TE>   "Stop killing us! Stop the spiritual violence!" one man shouted as
police dragged him behind the curtains at America's Center. A woman
from the group Soulforce, which claims Southern Baptist teachings
lead to violence against gays, shouted: "God loves his gay children!"</TE>
<TE>   "You need Jesus!" shouted back the Rev. Robert Smith, a pastor
from Cedar Bluff, Ala. Others hissed as protesters were led away.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters tried to disrupt Southern Baptist President James
Merritt's keynote address to nearly 9,000 delegates and their
families.</TE>
<TE>   Merritt took aim at the media and Hollywood, citing surveys that
show nearly unanimous acceptance in those groups of homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more we're being told sit down, shut up, go along, get
along, be inclusive, be tolerant, be nice and be quiet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We now face the fact that there are certain groups that are going
to protest us every year," he said. "They have let me know in their
correspondence, 'We are not going away.' Well, I've got news for the
pornographer, the adulterer, the homosexual, the pedophile, the
abortionist: We are not going away either."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, President Bush railed against human cloning and
celebrated the Baptists' refusal to separate religious faith from
politics.</TE>
<TE>   "True faith is never isolated from the rest of life, and faith
without works is dead," Bush said in a speech broadcast live from the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Baptists claim more than 16 million members.</TE>

<HD>2 More Bishops Resign Over Sexual Accusations</HD>
<DH>Religion: As a meeting over the scandal nears, Catholic
officials quit in New York and Kentucky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As U.S. Roman Catholic bishops prepare for a critical meeting in
Dallas this week to adopt a national policy on sexual abuse of minors
by priests, two more of their members resigned Tuesday as a result of
charges of sexual misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, 59, resigned as
bishop and pastor of a suburban parish after admitting to having had
"a number of affairs with women over the course of several years,"
officials of the Archdiocese of New York announced.</LD>
<LD>   In Lexington, Ky., Bishop Kendrick Williams, 65, who has been
accused of molesting three boys, ages 12 to 18, announced that Pope
John Paul II had accepted his resignation. Williams, who earlier had
relinquished his pastoral duties pending the outcome of a church
investigation, denied the charges.</LD>
<TE>   The Vatican said the pope had accepted Williams' resignation
because of "illness or some other grave reason." The Vatican made no
mention of an interim or permanent successor.</TE>
<TE>   The resignations brought to four the number of bishops who have
resigned this year amid sexual misconduct charges. They're likely to
deepen the sense of urgency surrounding what the bishops themselves
have described as "a crisis without precedent in our times." That
description opens a draft document that the bishops will consider at
their meeting as the church's response to the sex abuse scandal that
has shaken the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal has centered on the sexual abuse of minors by
pedophile priests, but as it has gained momentum it has also ensnared
others, such as McCarthy, who have been accused of other forms of
sexual misconduct. New York archdiocese officials said their
information indicated that none of the women involved with McCarthy
was a minor at the time of the affair.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the New York archdiocese, said
church officials first learned of the allegations against McCarthy in
a letter they received Saturday. Zwilling wouldn't say who sent the
letter, but he said McCarthy later confirmed the charges.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the archdiocese said, "It is not known if the
affairs raise any legal issues, but the archdiocese will cooperate
with the district attorney if there is an investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Edward Egan in New York also issued a statement
expressing his "personal care and concern for all involved in this
situation, in particular any women and their families who may have
been hurt, and Bishop McCarthy as well." Referring to the Dallas
meeting, Egan asked for prayers "that we will see a return to
holiness and sanctity on the part of all clergy and that we might
begin to heal the wounds that have been inflicted."</TE>
<TE>   Zwilling said McCarthy's resignation as auxiliary bishop, a post
he's held since 1999, will be effective when it's accepted by the
pope. He said McCarthy also resigned as pastor of St. Elizabeth Ann
Seton Parish in Shrub Oak, N.Y., and had been instructed by Egan not
to function as a priest.</TE>
<TE>   "I have grievously sinned and long ago asked for the Lord's
forgiveness," said McCarthy, who also begged absolution of his
parishioners, his fellow clergy and his family.</TE>
<TE>   Williams became the first bishop of the newly created Lexington
diocese in 1988. The charges against him involved an alleged
molestation in 1969 and two other alleged molestations in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Williams announced May 23 that he was temporarily stepping aside
pending the outcome of an investigation into the first of the
allegations against him, which he denied. But in a statement Tuesday,
the Lexington diocese said Williams submitted his resignation to the
Vatican on May 31.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not want my resignation to give any credence to the
allegations made against me," Williams said in a statement. "I
offered my resignation to the Holy Father, stating that I believe
that by my stepping down, the diocese can rid itself of the cloud
which hangs over it and me at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee resigned
after the disclosure of a $450,000 settlement the archdiocese made in
1998 with a man who had accused Weakland of sexually abusing him as
an adult more than 20 years ago. In March, Bishop Anthony O'Connell
of Palm Beach, Fla., resigned after admitting he abused an underage
student when he was the rector of a Missouri seminary.</TE>

<HD>Colleges Could Yield 'Dirty' Bomb Materials</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Medical labs and nuclear reactors produce the
needed radioactive substances. And some say their security can be
lax.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- At UCLA, nearly 11,000 parcels containing radioactive
materials arrive on campus each year, and 4,700 people are authorized
to use the potentially hazardous substances. At UC Davis, UC Irvine
and more than 20 other universities nationwide, staff members run
nuclear reactors for research purposes.</LD>
<LD>   From medicine to archeology to training nuclear engineers,
radioactive material long has played an important role on campus. On
Tuesday, the potential dangers were highlighted when the Pentagon's
second-ranking official suggested that Jose Padilla, the alleged
"dirty" bomb plotter, had his eyes on college sources for his planned
bomb.</LD>
<LD>   "This man actually thought he could get [radioactive substances]
from places like university labs," said Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy
secretary of Defense, on the NBC program "Today." "I have no idea how
difficult that would be, but there is nuclear material around a lot
of places."</LD>
<TE>   In recent years, several universities have been cited for lax
handling of radioactive materials--tossing them in the trash, leaving
them in unlocked rooms or allowing workers to be exposed at
unacceptable levels.</TE>
<TE>   But the schools involved have said they have improved procedures.
And since Sept. 11, tougher security measures have been required by
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees radioactive
materials, in some cases in tandem with state officials.</TE>
<TE>   Radioactive substances are used mainly in three areas on campuses:
in medical treatment at hospitals, in research labs and at the 28
university nuclear reactors used for research. "Just about every
major research university has research that involves radioactive
materials," said Alexander Adams, an NRC staff member.</TE>
<TE>   University officials say spent fuel from research reactors is only
occasionally stored on campus, is heavily secured and is so toxic
that it would take special procedures to transport it. But several
officials said they could not rule out that a determined person could
find less-toxic types of waste from biology laboratories or
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's always the potential for someone to do that,"
said Rick Greenwood, who is in charge of environmental health at
UCLA. "Security on university campuses is not always the best."</TE>
<TE>   "If someone were trying to find radioactive materials to scare
people with, a vulnerable area would be medical schools," said Allen
Sessoms, a physicist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government and a member of an Energy Department advisory board on
nuclear research policy.</TE>
<TE>   These materials include a radioactive form of iodine, used to
control thyroid tumors, as well as technesium-99m, which doctors use
in scanning and imaging body parts, said Ara Tahmassian, assistant
vice chancellor for research services at UC San Francisco. Biologists
use other materials to tag molecules and track their movement through
a cell or organism.</TE>
<TE>   Less common are materials such as cesium 137, which is more toxic
and used to suppress the immune systems of research animals or to
cause mutations in cells, Tahmassian said.</TE>
<TE>   Most such research materials have a short half-life, meaning that
they lose their toxicity quickly, sometimes within hours. When used
in medical treatments, they are usually ordered specifically for each
patient because their potency fades so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   At UC San Francisco, all radioactive materials arrive at a central
place on campus, where they are logged in and then distributed to
labs or hospital offices. Under state and federal rules, all projects
that require radioactive materials need a license. Workers must be
trained to handle the materials.</TE>
<TE>   Waste materials are collected and stored at a central facility on
campus, and most is held until it decays and is no longer
radioactive, Tahmassian said. Most campuses hold waste for 90 to 120
days before shipping it to a commercial storage facility, including
one in Utah and one in South Carolina, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at MIT, UCLA and other universities described similar
procedures for receiving and handling radioactive materials.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear reactors were once more common on campuses. There were 64
in 1980, but a falloff in student interest and other factors has
reduced the number to 28 today.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a traditional nuclear plant, which aims to generate energy,
a research reactor produces energy as waste and radioactive material
as the useful product. The plants are used to train nuclear engineers
but also to make radioactive materials used in a wide variety of
other fields.</TE>
<TE>   To determine whether two pieces of ancient pottery come from the
same source, for example, an archeologist might bombard the pottery
fragments with neutrons from a reactor. The pottery would then emit
gamma rays. The ray patterns would reveal what tiny amounts of
various elements are inside the clay, allowing comparisons between
the pottery samples.</TE>
<TE>   Similar techniques can be used to determine what pollutants are in
an air sample or whether an old painting is really a forgery made
with modern paints. UC Irvine says its reactor has been used to
measure the lead content of the bullet that killed President Kennedy,
mercury levels in ancient specimens of swordfish and materials in
meteors, moon rocks and ancient bones.</TE>
<TE>   The NRC licenses research reactors and their operators. The
Department of Energy takes responsibility for transporting spent fuel
from research reactors and stores it at one of several of its sites,
a department spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   At MIT, the research reactor has been staffed by campus police
around the clock since Sept. 11, said Mitchell Galanek, the
university's radiation protection officer. Waste material from other
sources, such as biology labs, is collected and stored in a facility
adjacent to the reactor, which is locked but not continually guarded
by campus police, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The NRC has oversight responsibility for radioactive materials,
but about 28 states have signed agreements to share responsibility.
They include California and Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   According to press reports, universities have been cited by the
NRC several times in recent years for lax handling of radioactive
materials.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Scripps Howard News Service reported on several
university violations of NRC rules, including two "unplanned
radiation field events"--radiation leaks--at the University of
Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   The university said it made staff changes and hired new managers
after the incidents, the news service reported.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Associated Press reported that an NRC inspector
complained of a "cavalier" attitude toward the handling and disposal
of radioactive materials by personnel at several Massachusetts
universities.</TE>

<LD>   Marine mammal experts will capture a sick, orphaned young killer
whale near Seattle on Thursday in an unprecedented and daring attempt
to reunite the 1-ton mammal with its family in Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Emaciated, covered with lesions and having foul breath hinting at
digestive problems, the black-and-white female has captivated
residents by sidling up to ferries and other boats in Puget Sound.</TE>

decision to snare her, treat her ailments in an aquatic cage and then

<LD>   The Salt Lake City police chief said detectives have refocused
their investigation into the disappearance of Elizabeth Smart on
those who knew the 14-year-old girl and vowed to the unidentified
suspect: "We are going to get you."</LD>
<LD>   Despite looking into hundreds of tips, police have not yet focused
on a suspect and have not ruled out a stranger abduction. But Police
Chief Rick Dinse indicated at a Salt Lake City news conference that
the investigation had narrowed.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe that it is possible that we have already talked to, or
will soon talk to, the suspect that is responsible for this crime,"
the chief said. Investigators spent several hours in the Smart home
early Tuesday, searching for clues to the girl's June 5
disappearance. Police said they have ruled out the possibility that
the girl staged her own abduction and is a runaway.</TE>

<HD>Closing Arguments in Mayor's Trial</HD>
<DH>Crime: Scoundrel or visionary? Fate of Rhode Island's
Cianci is in jurors' hands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</DL>
<LD>The Renaissance City was for sale, a federal prosecutor said here
Tuesday--with proceeds going to the man who takes full credit for
revitalizing this onetime backwater, Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr.</LD>
<LD>   But in closing arguments at Cianci's trial on racketeering,
corruption and extortion charges, his own lawyer spent nearly the
full hour allotted to him painting his client as "a visionary" and
government witnesses as liars, scoundrels and, in one memorable
depiction, "a pig."</LD>
<LD>   Cianci--who bills himself both as the longest-serving mayor in the
city's history and as the longest-serving big-city mayor in modern
America--is charged with 12 counts of racketeering, extortion and
fraud. Along with co-defendants Frank Corrente--formerly a top Cianci
aide--and auto body shop owner Richard Autiello, he is accused of
taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks, often disguised
as campaign contributions.</LD>
<TE>   Cianci also is alleged to have strong-armed a prestigious downtown
club that had shunned him into giving him a free lifetime membership.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Cianci carry up to 210 years in prison and
$3.75 million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   The government maintains that the pattern of corruption at City
Hall stretched from 1991 to 1998; the Justice Department
investigation was dubbed Operation Plunder Dome. Over the course of
an eight-week trial, there were government informants, scratchy
surveillance videotapes and a parade of 55 witnesses ranging from tow
truck drivers to a former governor to a mother who just wanted to get
her son a spot at the Police Academy.</TE>
<TE>   Yet through it all, the 61-year-old Cianci has remained a popular
figure here. A poll released Tuesday by Brown University gave him a
59% approval rating. In the same poll, 52% of those surveyed said
they thought the mayor was guilty of corruption--but only 15% said
they thought the jury would convict him.</TE>
<TE>   Barred by a gag order from discussing his trial, the mayor--first
elected in 1974--often stopped to mug for photographers and to chat
outside the courthouse about his leisure activities.</TE>
<TE>   Outspoken and flamboyant, Cianci survived a scandal in which he
pleaded no contest in 1984 to ordering his bodyguard to attack his
estranged wife's boyfriend with a fireplace log. First elected as a
Republican, the mayor left office after that incident and was elected
again in 1990 as an independent.</TE>
<TE>   Cianci, who sports an assortment of well-maintained toupees,
markets pasta sauce bearing his name. His high living, quick wit and
avid promotion of his hometown have turned him into a local
celebrity. Like a rock star, he is known widely by a single name--his
childhood diminutive, Buddy.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutor Richard Rose, however, Cianci would better
be known as the head of "a corrupt, criminal enterprise"
headquartered at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of the enterprise was to enrich Cianci personally and
politically through bribes, extortion and mail fraud," Rose said,
describing "the average price of admission" as $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Want a job with the city? $5,000," the prosecutor said. "Want to
grease the chairman of the tax board? $5,000. Anything for a price."</TE>
<TE>   Pacing before the jury, gesturing dramatically and embellishing
his presentation with exclamations of "Oh, no!" Rose argued Tuesday
that a conspiracy was in place because "something was given, and
something was demanded. Ladies and gentlemen, there was a quid pro
quo."</TE>
<TE>   He also played a segment of an FBI videotape showing a Cianci
co-defendant warning an informant: "There are no free lunches. It's
the money that counts. Capisce? Understand?"</TE>
<TE>   For his part, defense attorney Richard M. Egbert began his
summation by describing a predawn walk Tuesday around Providence. He
talked about recent urban landmarks, such as a shopping mall called
Providence Place, a new convention center and a fancy downtown hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Renaissance City," Egbert said. "Did Buddy do it
alone? Of course not. But he was the leader. He was the backbone. He
was the visionary."</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Egbert continued, Cianci made the mistake of trusting two
former city officials who are now in prison on corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they're bums," Egbert said. "We know they're thieves. We
know they're liars. We know David Ead and Joseph Pannone would take
50 bucks to lower your taxes. I mean, how low can you go? How much
closer to the underbelly of a snake can you get?"</TE>
<TE>   For emphasis, he called Ead "a pig."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides concluded their arguments by addressing the matter of
Cianci's membership in the exclusive University Club of Rhode Island.
While Judge Ernest Torres threw out several corruption counts against
the mayor, the question of how the club happened to give Cianci an
unpaid lifetime membership remained before the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Egbert, who tried repeatedly to have the University Club issue
tried separately, called it "absurd" to think that Cianci "set off to
extort" a membership from the staid old social organization.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, said Egbert, what Cianci actually got was "an honorary
membership. An honor--an honor that the University Club elected to
convey on him."</TE>
<TE>   But on the charge where the mayor appears to be the most
vulnerable, Rose asserted: "He wanted a membership from the
University Club, and when they wouldn't give it to him, he took it."</TE>
<TE>   The jury is expected to begin deliberations today.</TE>

<HD>President Pitches Homeland Security</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The U.S. is vulnerable, says Bush, as he opens a
drive to get public backing for department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>President Bush, using the commonplace to focus attention on the
extraordinary, toured a water treatment plant here Tuesday to drive
home his warning that, from the shoreline to the heartland, the
United States is vulnerable to new and frightening modes of terrorist
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Both his visit to the water facility and his speech at a nearby
high school reflected the single-minded attention that the White
House is devoting to win public support for a new Cabinet-level
Department of Homeland Security.</LD>
<LD>   Given new ammunition by the disclosure that an American, Jose
Padilla, was in military custody in connection with an alleged plot
to explode a radioactive ''dirty'' bomb, possibly in Washington, Bush
is launching a campaign much like the earlier ones he focused on
overhauling federal education programs and getting Congress to cut
taxes.</LD>
<TE>   He plans to keep up a steady drumbeat in coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Today he signs a bioterrorism bill at the White House and meets
with his newly named homeland security advisory committee, when he
will also make remarks about the urgency of the counter-terrorism
effort. William H. Webster, the former FBI and CIA director, was
among those named to the panel Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   It is part of what presidential aides predict will be a common
theme, both at the White House and on the road, as Bush carries that
message to audiences around the country and tries to build pressure
on Congress to complete work on his proposed government
reorganization as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Before flying here, Bush met with congressional leaders at the
White House, pressuring them to move swiftly on his plan to create
the department.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're in for a long struggle in this war on terror,'' the
president said during a photo session in the Cabinet Room. ''There
are people that still want to harm America.''</TE>
<TE>   Speaking later in the day to an audience in the Oak Park High
School gymnasium, Bush said the new department is needed to
effectively coordinate the federal government's anti-terrorism work,
which is now being done by about 100 agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that one person--''me''--would be held accountable
for success or failure in the anti-terrorism campaign, the president
noted:</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm the kind of fellow who likes to pick up the phone and say,
'How we doing?' ... I don't like the idea of calling 100 different
agencies; I like to call one and say, 'Here is the strategy, and what
are you doing about it?' ''</TE>
<TE>   Bush asked the audience to put pressure on Congress, which he
warned could stumble in an intramural fight over which committees
would gain responsibility for monitoring the new department and its
169,000 employees:</TE>
<TE>   ''I need the help of the American people to remind the turf
fighters not to be nervous, because we're talking about doing what's
right for America.''</TE>
<TE>   In explaining his reorganization plan to the audience, made up of
local residents--not all of them Bush supporters--the president
reduced it to its basics: Protecting the nation's borders (''We need
to know who's coming in and why they're not going out''), supporting
emergency response personnel, developing greater capacity to detect
impending attacks and weapons of mass destruction, and making better
use of information developed by the CIA, the FBI and other
intelligence operations.</TE>
<TE>   Illustrating the need to realign government agencies, Bush cited
the Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   ''Guess who they report to? The Transportation Department. The
Transportation Department is worried about highways and airplanes and
railroads,'' the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush went out of his way to praise the FBI, which has been sharply
criticized in recent weeks as details of missed cues and other lapses
have emerged in examinations of how government agencies functioned
before the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Singling out its director, he said: ''The FBI man running it now,
a guy named Robert Mueller, came on one week before September the
11th. That's when he started his job. He's had his hands full. But
he's a good man. He knows what to do.''</TE>
<TE>   The White House has shown itself adept at focusing almost
exclusively on one issue and thus largely controlling the public
agenda. Such was the case when the administration fought for
congressional approval of its tax cut and its education proposals,
gearing nearly all of the president's travels to audiences to which
he could drive home his political arguments.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment plant, which provides water to 800,000 residents of
Missouri and Kansas, offered just such an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the plant has increased its security to provide
protection 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which was not the case
before the attacks. It has also increased its monitoring of intake

<HD>Clinton Transition Left $15,000 Damage, GAO Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A yearlong investigation into whether Clinton
administration aides left the White House in fraternity-party
disarray as they vacated the presidential premises has turned up
about $15,000 in damage, according to a government report released
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) asked the General Accounting Office last
June to look into allegations that Clinton staffers had ripped phone
cords from walls, left obscene voicemail messages, defaced bathrooms
and vandalized computer keyboards by removing the ''W'' keys when
they left the White House. A number of items, including a 12-inch
presidential seal and several antique doorknobs, were assumed stolen.</LD>
<LD>   ''The Clinton administration treated the White House worse than
college freshmen checking out of their dorm rooms,'' Barr said
Tuesday. ''They disgraced not just themselves but the institution and
the office of the presidency as well.''</LD>
<TE>   The GAO concluded that ''damage, theft, vandalism, and pranks did
occur in the White House during the 2001 presidential transition.''
The report stated that some incidents, such as removing keyboard
keys, placing glue on desk drawers and leaving obscene voicemail
messages ''clearly were intentional,'' and intentional damage would
constitute a criminal act under federal law. No prosecutions are
planned, though.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton supporters countered that the amount of trash was typical
of any presidential turnover and that there was little money to
replace chair backs, desk locks, mirrors and other items broken
before the transition due to ordinary use. Items that Bush
administration officials replaced, including two cameras and 26
cellular phones, were left in the presidential offices, Clinton
staffers told investigators.</TE>
<TE>   ''The work on this that Mr. Barr did and the White House did cost
more than the people moving out of the office,'' said Jake Siewert, a
member of Clinton's White House press office who was working during
the transition. "The White House was in pretty good shape, but
obviously you have some damage from 500 people transiting in and out
of it.''</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers characterized the investigation as a witch
hunt and a waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars. "The
GAO's report confirms what many of us have long known to be true:
Claims made by Bush administration officials of widespread vandalism
at the White House during the transition just weren't true,'' said
Rep. Anthony D. Weiner (D-N.Y.). "The Bush administration owes them a
long-overdue apology.''</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the GAO comptroller, White House counsel Alberto R.
Gonzales criticized the report for minimizing the number of
pranks--which the GAO put at two dozen--and for failing to detail
them. Notes in desks or affixed to filing cabinets allegedly left by
Clinton staffers reading ''GET OUT,'' ''Hail to the thief'' and ''W
happens'' were shown to investigators but were not included in the
report, the letter said. Other pranks included stickers in the West
Wing depicting President Bush as a chimpanzee and a photograph in an
Executive Office Building safe showing a blank election ballot with
the word ''chad'' spelled out in punch holes.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO interviewed 78 Bush and 72 Clinton aides. Bernard Ungar,
who was in charge of the investigation, said one GAO employee worked
on it full-time for about nine months.</TE>

<HD>Opponent of Human Cloning Might Modify Plan for Ban</HD>
<DH>Science: Kansas senator raises the possibility of a
two-year moratorium instead of complete halt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The leading Senate opponent of human cloning said Tuesday that he
might seek a two-year moratorium on the technique instead of a total
ban, a move that would be a significant victory for scientific and
patient-advocacy groups that want human cloning to remain a legal
tool in the hunt for cures for disease.</LD>
<LD>   While there is wide support for a ban on reproductive cloning,
which would produce children, Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) has
introduced legislation to bar the technique for medical research as
well. The House has already passed a ban on human cloning for any
purpose, and President Bush has said that he would sign such
legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of cloning for medical research, often called
therapeutic cloning, say it is immoral because it requires the
creation and then destruction of human embryos.</LD>
<TE>   Bush on Tuesday restated his opposition to human cloning in any
form. ''We believe that a life is a creation, not a commodity, and
that our children are gifts to be loved and protected, not products
to be designed and manufactured by human cloning,'' the president
said by satellite to a convention of Southern Baptists in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Two Senate aides said that Brownback, during a meeting of Senate
Republicans, had stated his intention to abandon a total ban and
instead seek a two-year moratorium. A third Senate aide cautioned
that Brownback was only considering various options.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Brownback's comments suggested that he had not garnered the
60 votes that, under the rules of the Senate, would likely be
required for victory. ''He stated he needed to go to a lesser
standard'' in hopes of gaining more support, said Sen. Arlen Specter
(R-Pa.), according to Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Specter supports legislation, co-sponsored by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others, that would allow scientists to
create cloned embryos for research but bar transfer of a cloned
embryo to a woman's womb to produce a child.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who also favors
therapeutic cloning, said he is ''increasingly confident'' that a
measure barring only reproductive cloning will win the required 60
votes.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is unlikely that Bush or the House would accept a
measure that puts a ban on reproductive cloning while preserving it
for research.</TE>
<TE>   The issue could come to the Senate floor as early as Friday, said
Daschle, who controls the Senate calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of therapeutic cloning denounced the idea of a
moratorium and said they believe that it will not pass the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   ''A moratorium is a ban,'' said Sean Tipton, spokesman for the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ''What is attractive to
opponents of cloning is that this would put a stop to the research,
and so they could argue forever that it is an unproven technique.''</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said: ''A moratorium of a year or
two may not seem like much to you and me, but it could mean the
difference between life and death for a patient with Parkinson's
disease, diabetes, cancer or many other serious disorders.''</TE>
<TE>   The use of cloning techniques to cure disease has not been proved
and at best is years away.</TE>
<TE>   The vision is that a patient with faulty heart, brain or other
cells could donate a single cell that through cloning could be
transformed into millions of the healthy cells that the patient
needs.</TE>
<TE>   That transformation would require merging the patient's donated
cell with an egg cell to produce an embryo, which would be dissected
at age five days for its stem cells. Stem cells, in theory, can be
grown into any cell or tissue of the body.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning has created unusual political alliances. Most abortion
opponents and social conservatives favor a total ban on cloning. They
have been joined by several feminist and progressive groups, which
argue that cloning is a step toward creating ''designer children''
with made-to-order traits and would exploit women by creating a
market for human eggs.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a leading abortion opponent, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch
(R-Utah), favors therapeutic cloning. He argues that a cloned embryo
in a laboratory dish is not equivalent to a human embryo in the womb,
and it is ethical to destroy laboratory embryos for research.</TE>

<HD>Padilla Didn't Convert to Islam While in Jail, Ex-Employer
Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It was not in his jail cell but while working at a Taco Bell with his
girlfriend that suspected Islamic terrorist Jose Padilla embraced his
new faith, his former manager said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Both Jose and Cherie were interested in Islam," remembered
Mohammed Javed, 49, a Pakistani immigrant who managed the fast-food
Mexican restaurant in Davie, a town west of here. "As employer, I
couldn't go into religion. I told him: 'Check the Yellow Pages, and
you'll find where to go. Any mosque, any imam will help you.' "</LD>
<LD>   Javed recalled a hard-working young man, but one he said might
have been particularly vulnerable to manipulation. "He was very
poor," Javed said. "The way to get recruits is to lure them with
money.</LD>
<TE>   "He fell into the wrong hands."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, the former Chicago youth gang member and a woman he would
eventually marry, Cherie Maria Stultz, showed up at Javed's
restaurant looking for work, and both were hired. That October,
Padilla was released from jail after serving a 10-month sentence for
shooting at another motorist during a road rage incident, Broward
County Sheriff Ken Jenne said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, there were 20 Islamic centers or mosques in the
area, and they could have gone to any one of them," said Javed,
co-founder of the Broward School of Islamic Studies, a school and
mosque. "They could have gone to any mosque. All it takes [to
convert] is to say: 'I believe in one God, and Muhammad is the last
prophet, and I bear witness to that.' "</TE>
<TE>   After becoming a Muslim, Padilla started calling himself Ibrahim,
and Stultz changed her first name to Marwa, Javed said. Padilla
worked at the Taco Bell for two years, then disappeared. His
relations with his manager never went beyond those of
employer-employee, Javed said.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of them were very ... hard-working, no problem whatsoever,"
Javed said.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a call to the local FBI office last night and told them I
knew this man, and if there's anything I can do ... ," said Javed,
who came to the United States in 1971. He said he and other Muslim
activists in South Florida still were trying to pin down when and
where the conversions took place.</TE>
<TE>   "What's scary is that we didn't pay any attention," he said. "We
don't question if people are Muslims by birth or conversion. Mosques
and centers will have to be more careful.</TE>
<TE>   "We must remind everyone that we must defend America first."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, now 31, has told government interrogators that he first
became interested in Islam while serving time in Broward County,
according to law enforcement officials in Washington. At a news
conference at sheriff's headquarters here, Jenne said he had
unearthed no evidence that Padilla, also known now as Abdullah al
Muhajir, had become a Muslim while incarcerated following his Oct. 8,
1991, arrest for the road rage episode.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not have any documents that support that this conversion
took place in the jail," Jenne said. "We do not have any
documents--and we do have documentation for that period of time--that
shows that he requested to speak to an imam, that he asked to attend
any Islamic classes or services, and we do not have any request that
he changed his name while at the jail."</TE>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Alarmed by the slayings of 12 children so far this year, Detroit
officials announced a plan Tuesday to raze thousands of abandoned
homes and put more police on the streets.</LD>
<LD>   At least two of the children slain this year had been caught in
the cross-fire of drug-related shootings, and drug dealers routinely
operate out of some of Detroit's 10,000 or so abandoned homes.</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Jerry Oliver said the department will also reorganize
itself to put more officers on the street. And the Wayne County
prosecutor's office will more closely monitor people on probation who
have committed gun crimes.</LD>

<HD>Blaze Near Denver Area Homes Slows but Evacuations Proceed</HD>
<DH>Fires: Shifting winds bring mixed news. Biggest outbreak
grows to about 87,000 acres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The capricious fire burning on the edge of Denver's southern suburbs
slowed on Tuesday, but the evacuation of nervous residents continued
as fire officials warned that late afternoon winds could push the
blaze toward homes.</LD>
<LD>   The Hayman Fire grew to about 87,000 acres and Tuesday's shifting
winds brought mixed news. The fire's southern edge exploded, breaking
though fire lines during the day. Fifteen subdivisions were evacuated
near Lake George, about 120 miles south of Denver.</LD>
<LD>   The northern end of the fire--which caused the evacuation of 6,000
homes and the potential displacement of 40,000 residents near
Denver--slowed its movement toward densely populated subdivisions,
although thousands remained poised to leave.</LD>
<TE>   The fire was believed to have started from an illegal campfire.
Authorities said Tuesday they were looking for a motorist who was
spotted by a forest ranger driving quickly away from the campground
where the fire began on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Open fires are banned throughout the state. On Tuesday Wyoming
joined Colorado in banning fires and fireworks on all state land.</TE>
<TE>   There are seven major fires burning in Colorado, which is
experiencing its worst drought on record.</TE>
<TE>   A fire in Glenwood Springs west of Denver was still only 5%
contained and had burned 10,500 acres. That fire, which began
Saturday, destroyed 25 homes and caused the evacuation of more than
2,000 people. Authorities allowed some residents back in their homes
to recover personal items, but said if they remained there, it would
be at their own risk.</TE>
<TE>   Another fire near Trinidad, on the New Mexico state line, grew to
29,000 acres. A nearby fire that consumed 5,700 acres was nearly
under control. Officials were also concerned about a fire near
Durango, in the southwest, which covered 8,300 acres and was a
quarter-mile from a subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters were gaining the upper hand on a 2,200-acre fire near
Grand Junction, in western Colorado, that caused some evacuations.</TE>
<TE>   The state's fires drew the attention of federal officials, who
toured fire sites and pledged assistance. Joe Allbaugh, head of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, joined Interior Secretary Gale
A. Norton on a tour of the Hayman Fire, led by Gov. Bill Owens.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a serious crisis right now," Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor noted that the state has requested federal fire
assistance eight times in the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Nine requests have already been made this year.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriffs in four counties issued evacuation orders to residents in
the path of the Hayman Fire, but the shifting winds made definitive
plans difficult.</TE>
<TE>   That was also the case for firefighters, who for a second day were
not placed in front of the fire, which was deemed too dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "The tactic is to attack the flanks and get some [firefighters] at
the southern end," said Randy Welch of the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   Four air tankers and 11 helicopters were fighting the blaze, which
was still out of control.</TE>

<DL>ROSEAU, Minn.</DL>
<LD>The rain-swollen Roseau River broke through a sandbag dike Tuesday in
this northwestern Minnesota town, spilling into yards and streets.</LD>
<LD>   Police ordered a handful of people living close to the floodwaters
to leave; others who heeded voluntary evacuation orders were bused to
Red Cross stations in a nearby town.</LD>
<LD>   "We're having the flood of our lives here," Mayor Jeff Pelowski
said.</LD>
<TE>   Members of the Salvation Army, Army Reserve and volunteers in
waders and baseball caps stacked sandbags along the river banks and
around homes in this community of 2,500 people, about 10 miles south
of the Canadian border.</TE>
<TE>   While the river wasn't expected to crest until today, the forecast
called for more rain following the 5 to 12 inches that has fallen
since the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Flood stage is 16 feet in Roseau, which set its old record of 21.1
feet in 1996. The water was at 22.26 feet Tuesday, and the National
Weather Service projected a crest of 23 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Lundgren stood in ankle-deep water that was fast filling the
yard around his one-story home, where he vowed to stay until it crept
inside.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get any more rain, I don't know what I can do. Let it take
its toll, I guess," Lundgren said.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Jesse Ventura ordered assistance to the nine surrounding
counties in Minnesota's northwest corner from the National Guard,
which responded with two helicopters to shuttle empty sandbags and
other supplies. The Army Corps of Engineers sent water pumps,
engineers and 80,000 sandbags.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, an army of dump trucks and more than 500 sandbaggers
worked feverishly to protect a snowmobile plant from the rushing
water.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the economic engine for Roseau County," said Tom Tiller,
chief executive and president of Polaris Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though a lot of people have lost their homes, the idea is at
least they'll have a job."</TE>
<TE>   The situation was better in Warroad, where the Warroad River went
over its banks Monday but started receding early Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 households were evacuated Monday afternoon. Some
businesses remained closed Tuesday, but more than half had reopened.</TE>

<HD>GOP Senators Block Legislation to Expand the Scope of Hate
Crimes</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans blocked action on a hate crime
measure Tuesday, refusing to cut off debate on a bill that would make
a federal crime of violent attacks prompted by victims' sexual
orientation or disabilities.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats, pushing the measure in an election year, said they
would try again.</LD>
<LD>   "Senate Republicans made clear that they will not take action to
fight terrorism at home," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a
longtime champion of the bill. "Today's vote is a clear sign of the
lack of commitment by Senate Republicans on this basic civil rights
issue."</LD>
<TE>   The bill would add crimes motivated by sex, sexual orientation and
disability to the list of offenses already covered under a 1968 hate
crime law that prohibits attacks based on race, religion or national
origin. It would allow federal prosecutors to pursue a hate crime
case if local authorities refuse to press charges.</TE>
<TE>   The 54-43 vote derailed efforts to win a speedy vote on the
legislation and send it to the House, which has rejected it twice in
recent years. While it takes only a simple majority to pass a bill, a
motion to end debate to allow consideration of the bill itself
requires 60 votes.</TE>

<HD>Roles of FBI, CIA in Security Debated</HD>
<DH>Government: Lawmakers question agencies' ability to fight
terrorism from outside new security group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Whether the FBI and CIA should be included in the proposed Department
of Homeland Security emerged Tuesday as a potentially central issue
in the congressional debate over President Bush's plan for the
massive new Cabinet-level department.</LD>
<LD>   Several Democratic and Republican lawmakers expressed concern
about the Bush administration's exclusion of the FBI and CIA from its
plans for the department, asserting that it could undermine the
agencies' ability to combat terrorist attacks on America.</LD>
<LD>   "In this kind of war, information is even more your critical
currency," said House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas). "We may
have to pull these agencies more formally into the structure."</LD>
<TE>   As Congress conducted its first hearing on Bush's proposal,
several lawmakers said they were eager to act quickly on what would
be the most sweeping reorganization of the federal government in more
than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   But they also pelted the plan's proponents with questions. For
example: What would happen to the non-defense duties of agencies that
would be part of the new department, including the Coast Guard's
charge of stopping foreign vessels from poaching in U.S. waters and
the Agriculture Department's work to prevent crop-eating medflies
from entering the country.</TE>
<TE>   The questions underscore the turf battles expected to complicate
congressional action on the reorganization plan. While House Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) suggested finishing work on the
bill by Sept. 11--the anniversary of the terrorist attacks on
America--other leaders were skeptical about that timing. "That will
be hard to achieve, but it's a worthwhile goal," said Senate Minority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.). "This is a very large reorganization.
Congress needs to make sure we do it in the right way."</TE>
<TE>   Some congressional experts have wondered whether lawmakers will be
able to send Bush a bill before they adjourn for the year in October.</TE>
<TE>   But former Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), an expert on national
security issues, predicted in an interview Tuesday that the pressure
of the November elections will prod lawmakers to act. "This is too
important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Bush unveiled his plan for the department, which some
in Congress had already suggested. The department would include the
Coast Guard, Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and the newly created Transportation Security Administration,
among other agencies. It would have almost 170,000 employees and a
budget of more than $37 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The new department would analyze intelligence from the FBI and the
CIA, and would not gather information itself. "We need to find out
how the new secretary of Homeland Security will obtain key
information from other agencies like the FBI, like the CIA," said
Rep. James Gibbons (R-Nev.).</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said he was worried that under
Bush's proposal, the new department would be a "passive customer of
whatever the CIA or FBI sends them."</TE>
<TE>   Some in Congress have argued that the FBI should remain separate
because it is a law enforcement agency with many responsibilities
unrelated to homeland defense. Others said that prohibitions on
domestic spying by the CIA also would make it difficult to make that
agency part of a Department of Homeland Defense.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters: "My
initial inclination is to be skeptical about taking actions where law
enforcement would fall under homeland defense."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. William "Mac" Thornberry (R-Texas) suggested that Congress
approve a bill creating the new department and deal later with the
questions about its interaction with the FBI and CIA. "Everybody
agrees we've got to make changes," he said. "You cannot pass one bill
that solves everything.... Delay in passing this bill helps the
terrorists because it means we are unprepared that much longer."</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's hearing before two House Government Reform
subcommittees, an array of senior officials from agencies that would
become part of the new department defended the Bush plan without
exception.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all leaning forward in the saddle to make this work," said
Michael Becraft, acting deputy commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. "This is the smart thing to do, and we need
to get on with it."</TE>
<TE>   However, the officials fielded pointed questions about whether
non-terrorism programs would be given short shrift.</TE>
<TE>   Adm. Thomas H. Collins, commandant of the Coast Guard, assured
lawmakers that the service would still come to the rescue of boaters
in distress. And Bobby R. Acord, head of the Agriculture Department's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said his agency would
continue to fight pests and diseases that threaten the food supply.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Adam Putnam (R-Fla.) remained unconvinced. "I wouldn't want
the Department of Homeland Security distracted by [the crop disease]
citrus canker in Florida," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Walnut Creek) wondered aloud why the
entire Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in her Northern
California district would become part of the new agency, "even though
only a small fraction of the work they do is relevant to homeland
security."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, "we can't get bogged down in these issues,
because we need to galvanize the support of Congress in order to move
forward."</TE>

<HD>Jewish Group Cites Growth in Anti-Semitism</HD>
<DH>Bias: Hostility has been stoked by Mideast violence and the
Sept. 11 attacks, the ADL says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Anti-Semitic sentiment in the United States has risen
since the Sept. 11 attacks and the upsurge in Palestinian-Israeli
violence, reversing a decade-long decline in anti-Jewish sentiment, a
prominent Jewish organization said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Anti-Defamation League said a survey of 1,000 Americans 18 or
older conducted early this year showed that 17% of Americans were
strongly anti-Semitic, up from the 12% seen in the previous survey
four years earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The survey said 48% of Americans hold no prejudices against Jews,
down from 53% in 1998. It had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe that Sept. 11 and the Mideast conflict have clearly
had an impact," said Abraham Foxman, the league's national director.
"As these life-altering events have transformed us as a nation, they
have also triggered the anti-Semitism that was already there but
buried beneath the surface."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Jewish attacks, mostly harassment and intimidation, rose in
2002, the ADL said. From January to May, the ADL reported 626
incidents, compared with 564 in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   The survey showed a slight increase in anti-Jewish sentiment, to
12% among white Americans, up from the 9% seen in 1998. The number of
blacks with strong anti-Semitic beliefs remained steady at 35%.</TE>
<TE>   Foxman said the survey showed what he called a distressing
increase in anti-Semitism from America's fastest-growing ethnic
group, Latinos. The survey showed that 44% of foreign-born Latinos
hold strongly anti-Semitic views, while 20% of Latinos born in the
United States were strongly anti-Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   The ADL was founded in 1913 to fight anti-Semitism and other forms
of religious, ethnic and racial discrimination.</TE>

<HD>Detention of a Citizen Questioned</HD>
<DH>Law: 'Dirty' bomb plot suspect was secretly held and hasn't
been charged. Denial of rights alleged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The case of Jose Padilla, the Brooklyn native now known as Abdullah
al Muhajir and the accused "dirty" bomb plotter, poses one of the
great unanswered questions in the law: Can the government arrest and
hold indefinitely an American citizen without charging him with a
crime?</LD>
<LD>   Typically, if the government arrests someone, it must bring
criminal charges against him and give him a lawyer and a public
trial.</LD>
<LD>   But wartime is different. Captured soldiers can be held until the
war ends. There are no charges or trials.</LD>
<TE>   Bush administration lawyers want to import the law of war into the
homeland fight against terrorism. And they want to hold Padilla
indefinitely as an "enemy belligerent," not as an accused criminal.
They plan to do so even though he is a U.S. citizen who was arrested
in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, this has set off considerable controversy among
lawyers and legal scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them dispute whether the Constitution gives the president
and his agents the power to hold a citizen in secret.</TE>
<TE>   "This seems to me the classic case for habeas corpus. They don't
get to say, 'This is a bad guy, and we can do with him what we want,'
" said Georgetown University law professor Mark Tushnet, referring to
administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   The right to habeas corpus--the Latin phrase for "you have the
body"--came from old English law. The doctrine gave people who were
thrown into the king's dungeons a right to be brought before a judge.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Constitution incorporated this idea, saying the right to
habeas corpus "shall not be suspended," except in cases of rebellion
or an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Tushnet said the principle of habeas corpus means that every
person has a right to his day in court.</TE>
<TE>   "It means, for example, the Army can't come to your house, take
you away and lock you up. That's the issue this case raises. The
point of habeas corpus is that it tests the legality of the
detention," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Administration lawyers agree that Padilla enjoys the right to
habeas corpus because he is a U.S. citizen being detained by the
government</TE>
<TE>   But the White House and Justice Department also believe that in
such a hearing, the federal courts will uphold the government's power
to hold Padilla as an enemy combatant. Prosecutors must show he was
actively working with Al Qaeda terrorists and against the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Under this theory, the government need not charge Padilla with a
specific crime or convict him in a trial. Its prosecutors need only
convince a judge that Padilla was acting as an enemy soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Goldsmith, an international law expert at the University of
Chicago, agrees with the administration's argument.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they can do this, and they are right to do it. Under
international law, if a nation captures an enemy belligerent, it can
hold him until the end of the war, and without a trial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Padilla is not a regular soldier, wasn't wearing a uniform
and wasn't part of an organized army, he has no right to the
protections afforded a prisoner of war, Goldsmith said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush legal team relies on the famous World War II case of
eight Nazi saboteurs who were captured shortly after they landed on
the Atlantic shores of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   They were subjected to a military trial held at the Justice
Department, sentenced to death and executed.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court took up their legal claims through a writ of
habeas corpus. But the justices ruled for the government and upheld
their executions. Two of the Germans were born in the United States,
but their claims of citizenship did not spare them.</TE>
<TE>   But critics have noted that this case clearly came in a declared
war, unlike today's fight against terrorism. Ultimately, the federal
courts will have to decide whether the administration can invoke
wartime law against a citizen arrested at home.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla is now being held without charge in a brig in Charleston,
S.C.</TE>
<TE>   A defense lawyer can file a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf to
bring his case before a federal judge there.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Donna R. Newman of New York, who represented Padilla after
his arrest on May 8, accused the government Tuesday of making up the
law and ignoring the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "My client is a citizen. The last time I looked at the
Constitution, he still has constitutional rights: the right to
counsel, the right to be charged by a grand jury," Newman told
reporters after a federal court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the administration may well fight her claims that
Padilla has a right to a lawyer and a right to be charged.</TE>
<TE>   The 6th Amendment guarantee of the right to a lawyer and to be
told of specific charges against a citizen applies only to criminal
prosecutions. Because no charges have been filed against Padilla,
"this is not a criminal case," another government lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators want to question Padilla at length, and they
do not want interference from a defense lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, the administration may resist allowing a lawyer
to consult privately with the accused dirty bomb plotter.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Newman complained that her client was whisked away
from New York on Sunday evening without her knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   When she presented papers charging the government with holding her
client illegally, the prosecutor replied he did not have the
authority to accept her papers on behalf of the Defense Department.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is breaking new ground," Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer John J. Goldman in New York contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>9 Months Later, Pentagon Marks End of Repairs</HD>
<DH>Ceremony: Building's facade, damaged in the Sept. 11
attack, is fitted with its last stone. Officials hope to finish
interior rehabilitation by the anniversary.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Workers fitted a blackened slab of limestone into place
at the Pentagon on Tuesday, marking nine months since the Sept. 11
attack by completing repair of the building's damaged facade.</LD>
<LD>   "You've healed this wall, and in doing so, you're helping to heal
this nation," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told a crowd
of construction workers at the site. He said the reconstruction
"honors those who died here and defies those who seek not to build
but to kill and destroy."</LD>
<LD>   The stone placed Tuesday was engraved with the infamous date it
was damaged when hijackers flew an American Airlines jet into the
Pentagon, killing themselves and 184 others.</LD>
<TE>   Behind it, Walker Lee Evey, head of the Pentagon renovation
program, placed a bronze "dedication capsule" containing names of the
victims and mementos of the terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Workers have rebuilt the portions of three outer rings of the
Pentagon that had to be torn down after the attack. The rebuilt
sections have to be finished with walls, wiring, fixtures and the
like before furniture, and then workers, can be moved back in.</TE>
<TE>   The project is on target to have people working in the outer ring,
where the plane hit, on the first anniversary of the attack, Evey
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials now estimate the reconstruction will cost $501 million,
Evey said, down from a $740-million estimate several months ago. He
said the Defense Department is considering spending the leftover $239
million on measures to further protect the Pentagon from future
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The rebuilt section has several protective features, including
more reinforced concrete, cloth lining the walls to prevent masonry
from turning into shrapnel, and more standpipes to reinforce the
sprinkler system.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers on Tuesday opened the
design competition for a Pentagon attack memorial.</TE>
<TE>   The competition is open to anyone. Carol Anderson-Austra, the
memorial project manager, said she expects to get hundreds, if not
thousands, of entries.</TE>
<TE>   Precise guidelines are not yet available, but the memorial will
have to fit in front of the spot where the Pentagon was hit and not
be so tall as to interfere with helicopter and airplane flights in
the area.</TE>
<TE>   Deadline for entries is Sept. 11. Anderson-Austra said they will
be judged by a nine-member team, including a relative of one of the
victims.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to have five or more finalists chosen in October
and the winning design picked by mid-December, Anderson-Austra said.</TE>

<HD>S.C. GOP Governor Primary in Runoff</HD>
<DH>Vote: On key privacy issue, N. Dakotans decide banks need
OK to sell customers' financial data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former congressman and South Carolina's lieutenant governor
advanced to a runoff for the state's Republican gubernatorial
nomination Tuesday, while North Dakota residents rejected a landmark
ballot issue on financial privacy.</LD>
<LD>   Congressional primaries were also decided in Maine and South
Carolina, as was the GOP gubernatorial primary in Maine.</LD>
<LD>   Former Rep. Mark Sanford and Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler were the top two
vote-getters in a seven-candidate field in South Carolina, but
neither received more than half the vote to avoid the June 25 runoff.</LD>
<TE>   The winner will challenge Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges, whose
promise of a state lottery to aid education helped him topple a
three-term GOP incumbent in 1998. Republicans hope to oust Hodges
this fall by tying him to South Carolina's rocky economy, increased
unemployment and deep cuts at state agencies.</TE>
<TE>   A runoff was also expected in South Carolina's 3rd Congressional
District, where six Republicans battled to succeed GOP Rep. Lindsey
O. Graham, who is seeking the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Strom
Thurmond.</TE>
<TE>   With about two-thirds of the vote reported, state Rep. Gresham
Barrett led the field with 44%. State Rep. Jim Klauber and former
prosecutor George Ducworth were neck-and-neck with about 20%. The top
two vote-getters will advance to a runoff. The GOP nominee in the
House race will face Democrat George Brightharp.</TE>
<TE>   In Maine, Republicans chose businessman Peter Cianchette over
educator Jim Libby in the gubernatorial primary.</TE>
<TE>   Cianchette will be the fifth candidate in the crowded race to
succeed independent Gov. Angus King, who is barred by law from
seeking a third consecutive term.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested in their Maine gubernatorial primaries were Democratic
Rep. John Elias Baldacci, who is leaving the House after four terms,
and Jonathan Carter, the Green Party candidate.</TE>
<TE>   In North Dakota, residents decided that banks must get written
permission to sell customer information to other businesses.</TE>

<HD>Judge Tosses Out One Charge in Shoe Bomb Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: An airplane is not a vehicle as defined in new
anti-terrorism law, he declares. Ruling backs contention of suspect
Richard C. Reid's lawyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A judge threw out one of nine charges against a man accused of trying
to blow up a jetliner with explosives in his shoes, ruling Tuesday
that an airplane is not a vehicle under a new anti-terrorism law.</LD>
<LD>   The charge, attempting to wreck a mass transportation vehicle, was
filed under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed by Congress after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge William Young said that although an airplane
can be engaged in mass transportation it is not a vehicle as defined
by the new law.</LD>
<TE>   Richard C. Reid still faces eight charges, including attempted
murder and attempted destruction of an aircraft. He allegedly tried
to light the explosives hidden in his shoes while aboard American
Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami three days before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha Martin, a spokeswoman for U.S. Atty. Michael Sullivan,
declined to comment on the ruling. She said no decision had been made
on whether to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Reid's lawyer, Owen Walker, did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said he looked to a legal definition of vehicle drafted
by Congress in an earlier law known as the Dictionary Act. That
defines a vehicle as something used as a means of transportation on
land.</TE>
<TE>   The USA Patriot Act was signed into law Oct. 26, giving the
government broad powers to fight terrorism. Among other things, it
expands the FBI's wiretapping and electronic surveillance authority
and gives police wide-ranging powers to search people's homes and
business records.</TE>
<TE>   The law punishes anyone who "willfully wrecks, sets fire to, or
disables a mass transportation vehicle or ferry."</TE>
<TE>   Reid's attorneys had argued at a hearing last month that there was
a defect in the law because it does not clearly define an airplane as
a vehicle of mass transportation.</TE>
<TE>   At that hearing, prosecutor Michael Keegan said Congress clearly
intended the act to cover violence or terrorism on airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came the same day Reid appeared for a hearing on a
motion to suppress a confession he made after he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyers say the statement was made after he was injected with
sedatives, which interfered with his ability to make a voluntary
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors claim the sedatives had little or no effect on Reid by
the time he had a formal interview with police later that day.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing on the confession was scheduled to continue today.</TE>
<TE>   Reid has been held without bail since his arrest Dec. 22. His
trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 4.</TE>

<HD>In Revealing Deep Throat, One Minor Technicality</HD>
<DH>History: John Dean was to publish his theory about the
Watergate informer online next week. But his subject is denying it
persuasively.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the latest round in Washington's greatest guessing game builds to
a crescendo on Monday's 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in,
the award-winning online magazine Salon plans to enter the Deep
Throat fray with a definitive 40,000-word accusation by scandal
veteran John W. Dean III.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe not.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect fingered in Dean's electronic book as Bob Woodward's
secret source not only denies the charge but has provided San
Francisco-based Salon with some pretty good evidence to the contrary.</LD>
<TE>   As Dean tries to sort through the arguments, Salon has warned some
business partners that it might miss the June 17 publication date it
announced in April. The Web site's main page had no mention of the
book Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything can happen, but right now we're still planning to
publish on 6/17 as planned," said Salon Managing Editor Scott
Rosenberg. "This has certainly been a complex story." Dean, who has
made two previous guesses about Deep Throat, acknowledged that his
book may miss the anniversary date.</TE>
<TE>   "It may or may not," he said in an interview Tuesday from his
Beverly Hills office. "If we don't make it by the 17th, we'll make it
one day."</TE>
<TE>   Dean is far from alone in the Deep Throat parlor game.</TE>
<TE>   Several books pushing one theory or another have been published
since President Nixon's resignation in 1974. Two years ago, former
Nixon White House Counsel Leonard Garment wrote a book naming
Republican strategist John Sears as Deep Throat. Sears denied it.</TE>
<TE>   And Former Chicago Tribune investigative reporter William Gaines
has said he will publish a list of half a dozen candidates and the
evidence for each this month. Woodward and his Washington Post
colleague Carl Bernstein have kept mum. Woodward has said he will
spill the beans after Deep Throat dies.</TE>
<TE>   Dean said two months ago that he had spent 20 years researching
his theory, evidently supplanting his 1982 guess of Alexander M. Haig
Jr., an aide to Henry A. Kissinger when the break-in occurred, and
his 1975 statement identifying Watergate prosecutor Earl J. Silbert
as the culprit. Both denied it.</TE>
<TE>   Like Garment a former White House counsel to Nixon, Dean's 1973
congressional testimony helped lead to the president's resignation.
He served six months in jail for his role in the cover-up.</TE>
<TE>   Dean has written for Salon in the past, and the struggling
Internet media company has staked its credibility on the book
project.</TE>
<TE>   "On the 30th anniversary of the June 17, 1972 Watergate break-in,
John Dean and Salon.com will unmask the real Deep Throat," magazine
editor-in-chief David Talbot wrote to the Web site's readers on May
2.</TE>
<TE>   Dean said that may still prove true. "I'm still on top of it. It's
not over till the fat lady sings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Salon hasn't said how much it will charge for Dean's electronic
book. It has been trying a variety of ways to turn a profit, cutting
staff and salaries and selling subscriptions for access to premium
articles on its site. Salon has published at least three books in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a liquidity squeeze, the company in March raised a badly
needed $500,000 investment from Adobe Systems Inc., which makes
programs for reading electronic books and other documents.</TE>
<TE>   But shares in Salon Media Group Inc. traded Tuesday at just 11
cents on the Nasdaq Small Cap Market. If the stock stays below $1, it
may be forced to move to over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Janet Hook contributed to this report.</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>A man charged with abducting, torturing and strangling two
prostitutes hanged himself in jail while under suicide watch,
possibly taking to the grave secrets about unsolved slayings of other
women.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators found Maury Troy Travis, 36, dead in his jail cell
Monday night. His death came as investigators continued an
investigation into the killings of 10 black women whose bodies were
found in the St. Louis area since April 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Police Capt. Harry Hegger said Tuesday that the case remains
active, with investigators still hoping to link Travis to several
victims.</LD>
<TE>   "Whether he's alive or dead, we have to bring some resolution to
these cases," Hegger said. "We're pretty sure he's responsible for a
large number of bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Travis, arrested Friday, surfaced after investigators traced to
him a letter and map sent last month to a newspaper, which led
authorities to a woman's corpse, according to a federal complaint
filed Friday.</TE>

<HD>'Dirty' Bomb Probe Widens</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: A suspect is interrogated in Pakistan. Officials
say plot may have involved an effort to steal nuclear material from a
university lab.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN, ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities overseas have interrogated a second suspect in the
alleged Al Qaeda plot to detonate a radioactive bomb in America,
officials said Tuesday, as investigators scrambled to determine if
other accomplices are in the United States, Switzerland, Egypt or
elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials also said the so-called "dirty" bomb plan
apparently called for stealing radioactive material from a U.S.
university laboratory or other American facility. Low-level nuclear
isotopes are widely used in medicine, research and industry.</LD>
<LD>   The plot, which was in its early stages, was foiled when CIA, FBI,
Customs and State Department agents identified and tracked Jose
Padilla--a Brooklyn-born Muslim convert who adopted the name Abdullah
al Muhajir--in Cairo and Zurich, authorities said. He was arrested
May 8 when he flew from Switzerland to Chicago on what officials
called a scouting mission for a terrorist attack.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush said Padilla was one of many "would-be killers"
that the U.S. has captured, and that it is looking for many more.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy Padilla's one of many who we've arrested," Bush said in
a meeting in his Cabinet Room. "The coalition we've put together has
hauled in 2,400 people. And you can call it 2,401 now. There's just a
full-scale manhunt on.... We will run down every lead, every hint.
This guy Padilla's a bad guy and he is where he needs to be:
detained."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Padilla has refused to cooperate since his arrest.
After President Bush decided Sunday that Padilla should be held as an
"enemy combatant" against the United States, rather than as a
criminal defendant, he was flown in a military C-130 to a
high-security Navy brig outside Charleston, S.C., where he has been
isolated from other inmates and is under heavy military guard.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Padilla's lawyer said at a federal court hearing in
New York that Padilla's continued detention is a violation of the
Constitution because he has not been charged and is being denied
access to legal counsel. "My client is a citizen," attorney Donna R.
Newman told reporters. "He still has constitutional rights."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee were given a
closed-door briefing on the case Tuesday as part of their
wide-ranging review into Sept. 11 intelligence failures. But some
members came away with more questions than answers, a congressional
source said.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern we'd like to pursue is, what's the substance of this?
Not many people were satisfied that we had a whole hell of a lot" on
Padilla in terms of hard evidence, the source said. "We're all for
sticking bad guys in the hole, but you've got to have evidence."</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. intelligence official said Pakistan had detained a
second suspect in the plot last month. The official said the man, who
has not been publicly identified but is from an Arab country, is
being interrogated by U.S. authorities at an undisclosed location.
There were conflicting reports as to whether Pakistan had handed the
suspect over to U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The second suspect traveled with Padilla to eastern Afghanistan
last fall to meet Abu Zubeida, Al Qaeda's operations chief, and later
accompanied Padilla to secret meetings with other senior Al Qaeda
leaders inside Pakistan to discuss the dirty-bomb proposal as well as
potential attacks against hotels, gas stations and other targets, the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Search for Accomplices</TE>
<TE>   One of the most urgent aspects of the investigation is whether
Padilla had other accomplices, particularly in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities do not believe Padilla acted alone or planned to
carry out a major attack in the United States without help from
others.</TE>
<TE>   "He clearly had associates, and one of the things we want to ask
him about is who those associates were and how we can track them
down," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said on CBS' "Early
Show."</TE>
<TE>   With evidence indicating that the FBI and CIA missed early clues
to the Sept. 11 attacks, members of Congress also pressed for
assurances that Padilla had no other U.S. accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the big questions," a congressional investigator
said.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said an
aggressive investigation had yet to find any American accomplices but
that the probe is continuing. Investigators also are checking to see
if possible accomplices may have entered and left the country.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how they operate, so there is good reason to assume that
may be the case here," the FBI official said.</TE>
<TE>   But a senior government official said investigators have found no
co-conspirators despite pursuing a number of investigative leads.
"I'm not picking up any sense that [investigators] believe anyone's
out there," the official said. "They're satisfied that there was no
one else here."</TE>
<TE>   A Pattern Emerges</TE>
<TE>   In other Al Qaeda plots, those actually carrying out the attacks
often are met in a target city by other Al Qaeda operatives. They may
provide safe houses, money, transportation, false documents and other
logistical help, said the FBI official.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case with Ahmed Ressam, who was convicted of plotting
a millennium bombing with Al Qaeda. Ressam was supposed to drive a
car laden with explosives from Canada into Washington state in
December 1999 and ultimately plant a bomb at Los Angeles
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   According to wiretaps and other evidence introduced at his trial
last year, Ressam was to be met by another operative who had flown in
from New York, as well as perhaps other co-conspirators in the
Seattle area. After Ressam testified that several accomplices had
helped him, two men were convicted in the case.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence officials said they had not determined if
Padilla was a seasoned Al Qaeda operative who had escaped detection
until recently or a vagabond freelance agent who somehow made contact
with senior Al Qaeda leaders last fall and was embraced by the group.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla got his new passport in March, but the local consular
official was concerned that Padilla might be involved in a case of
identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   "It was after the passport was issued [in March] that the consular
officer just felt there was something odd about the case and raised
it to the attention of the regional security officer, who looked into
it and then reported to the other elements of the consulate,
including the FBI," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery that Padilla had a long criminal record in Florida
and Illinois led to questions about why he was in Pakistan. The
information was forwarded to joint terrorism task forces, led by the
FBI, in Miami and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation picked up steam after FBI and CIA agents,
working with Pakistani authorities, captured Zubeida, the alleged
operations chief for Al Qaeda, in a raid in the Pakistani city of
Faisalabad on March 28.</TE>
<TE>   During an interrogation in late April, Zubeida told U.S.
authorities he was approached late last year at his hide-out in
Khowst, in eastern Afghanistan, by an American and another man who
proposed building a dirty bomb for use in the United States,
according to intelligence officials.</TE>
<TE>   ''He didn't identify him, or give a name, just a generic
description of him,'' one official said. ''It was fairly sketchy
information.''</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear how Padilla was able to find and meet Zubeida,
a fugitive who was the focus of an intense manhunt by U.S. and allied
forces at the height of the Afghan war last winter.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida may have escaped Afghanistan with Padilla at that point,
the official said. Padilla is known to have traveled with Zubeida
inside Pakistan early this year and spent time at an Al Qaeda site in
Lahore, in eastern Pakistan, to learn how to wire explosives and to
study radiological dispersal devices on the Internet. In March,
Padilla met with other Al Qaeda leaders in Karachi to further discuss
his plan.</TE>
<TE>   Interrogations Pay Off</TE>
<TE>   After interrogating other Al Qaeda prisoners detained at the U.S.
Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and checking immigration and other
documents, the CIA and other agencies quickly identified Padilla and
the second suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Agents then took passport photos of the two men back to Zubeida
for confirmation. ''He was surprised, but he said, 'Yes, that's
them,' '' an intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   By then, however, Padilla was gone. Pakistan had briefly detained
him and his accomplice for using false travel documents this spring.
But he was released after several days and left Karachi for Zurich in
early April.</TE>
<TE>   ''He wasn't known as Al Qaeda,'' the intelligence official said.
''He was just allowed to go.''</TE>
<TE>   Padilla subsequently flew to Egypt, where authorities believe he
has a wife and several children. U.S. intelligence caught up with him
there and are still seeking to determine if he had contacts with
Egyptian supporters of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   ''At some point, in the middle of this process, we pick him up in
Cairo,'' the intelligence official said. ''After that he was under
constant surveillance.''</TE>
<TE>   FBI and other agents trailed him in Cairo and then back to Zurich,
where they made sure Swiss authorities closely checked his baggage
and shoes--in case he sought to emulate accused ''shoe bomber''
Richard C. Reid--before he boarded a Swissair flight from Zurich to
Chicago on May 8.</TE>
<TE>   About six FBI agents, and an equal number of Swiss law enforcement
officers, secretly watched Padilla on the flight home, monitoring his
every move.</TE>
<TE>   ''There were an awful lot of people on that flight who could have
prevented'' anything from going wrong, said a U.S. law enforcement
official. ''We knew everything about the guy on that flight--where he
was going to sit and everything else. I don't think there was ever
anybody in danger on that flight.''</TE>
<TE>   Padilla told the FBI agents who arrested him at O'Hare that he had
come to ''see his son,'' a source said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking No More Risks</TE>
<TE>   A senior government official said the FBI considered letting
Padilla leave the airport and trailing him to see who he met, but
decided it was not worth the chance of losing him.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that on one of his Switzerland trips, Padilla
received some $10,000 in cash. The money was confiscated in Chicago,
but authorities are trying to determine who gave it to him and where
the money came from.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials had faced months of resistance from Swiss officials
who rejected the idea that terrorists were using their financial
institutions. But they quickly came on board in the Padilla
operation, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. official said the arrest, which involved the
combined efforts of at least four U.S. agencies, reflects the
''convergence of investigative strengths'' developed since Sept. 11.
Padilla's life remains a focus of intense scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Now 31, he and his family moved to Chicago when he was 4. His
first arrest, for the brutal stabbing death of a local man, came when
he was 14. At least four other arrests and two convictions for armed
robbery and battery followed. He worked at restaurants and hotels
when he wasn't in jail.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 1991, he jumped bail on a weapon charge and moved
to South Florida.</TE>
<TE>   He soon found himself in trouble again, charged with aggravated
assault and carrying a concealed weapon. It was after serving 10
months in the Broward County Jail that the man raised as a Roman
Catholic converted to radical Islam along with his future wife,
Cherie Maria Stultz.</TE>
<TE>   They both worked at a Taco Bell restaurant in Davie, near Fort
Lauderdale, close to about 20 Islamic centers or mosques. Padilla
disappeared after two years and the couple later divorced.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials now say Padilla had moved to Egypt by 1998. His
goal, they said, was to further explore Muslim teachings and
traditions. He stayed about two years, taking up with illegal
underground mosques that preach extremist forms of Islam, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities now are keen to find out who he met in Egypt, which
has battled Islamic extremists for years, and how he ultimately
gravitated toward a terrorist faction that vows to kill millions of
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official said Padilla ''definitely seemed to
be seeking out over time a more radical view.''</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, even the underground mosques did not satisfy him, and
teachers he met in Egypt pointed him to still more extreme factions
in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   ''Once he was there [in Egypt], he didn't feel like it was going
far enough, so he went to Pakistan and Afghanistan,'' the official
said. ''There was this progression with his growing radical
extremism.''</TE>

<HD>Packing Life and Love Into an Old Ford</HD>
<DH>Fire: Holdouts in Colorado scramble to choose what to save
from burning. Watercolors and photos are salvaged. So is half a cow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROXBOROUGH VILLAGE, Colo.</DL>
<LD>She packed the towels while he packed the tools. She ran downstairs,
then upstairs, then downstairs, stuffing toothbrushes and books and
bars of soap into pillowcases, while he stayed downstairs, hauling
the pillowcases out to their old black Ford.</LD>
<LD>   Their next-door neighbor had already cleaned out and gone. Their
neighbor across the street was just now peeling away in his Jeep.
They waved, sadly. Then they went back to packing and tried not to
panic, though they could taste the smoke and feel the air turning
thick in their throats.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday was evacuation day for Tony and Joyce Martinez, along with
14,000 other residents of Roxborough Village, a middle-class
neighborhood just 20 miles southwest of downtown Denver but directly
in the path of the biggest wildfire ever measured in Colorado. It was
a day of mass exodus. But first came a thousand small, wrenching,
decisions. What to take, and what to leave? How to distill the
contents of a life into a cardboard box, and how to forsake the rest
to fire?</LD>
<TE>   For days, while officials gave explicit orders to residents of
other towns along the fire line, they only encouraged the residents
of Roxborough to leave. So most Roxborough residents stayed put. They
couldn't bear to leave their tidy, sturdy houses, or their idyllic
horse pastures, or their notch in the blue-black shadow of the Rocky
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they waited to see what the fire might do, and waited for
officials to call and give them a clear command. And each hour that
passed without the dreaded call, each night without tongues of flame
licking the sandstone hogback that rims the neighborhood, gave them
hope.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was 10 miles away, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Tuesday morning, and the winds shifted, and the fire was
roaring on a northeastern slant, setting a course for Roxborough.
Evacuation seemed inevitable. Although the official phone calls still
hadn't come, residents gave in to their fears. They gathered in their
streets and driveways, said goodbye to each other and to their
houses, and perhaps to a whole way of life they had come to love.</TE>
<TE>   Tony and Joyce Martinez told themselves they were packing "just in
case." But they knew they would probably be gone long before
nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Joyce called out, "I seriously think it's time to
go." Tony didn't hear.</TE>
<TE>   She shoved a few more things into a sack and carefully scanned the
master bedroom, her breath coming fast, as if the house were already
on fire. She studied every object--washcloth, computer, shoe,
Bible--and imagined life without it. "I've got a feeling we might not
be coming back to this house," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly she stumbled upon a photo of her and Tony as love-struck
teens, hugging in front of Lake Michigan. She stopped, gazing at the
photo, as if she had all week to contemplate the past. Yes, she
decided, yes, that photo must come with us. She placed it carefully
in a box--after showing it to Tony, with a smile--then moved quickly
to the next thing: Keep or not keep? Throw it in the back of the
truck, or onto a possible pyre of their possessions?</TE>
<TE>   Before retiring to this outlying suburb of Denver two years ago,
Tony and Joyce spent 42 years of marriage roaming the United States,
following their children, and everywhere they went the forces of
nature seemed bent on spoiling things. "Always the elements drove us
away," said Tony, 65. "It was hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Snow
blizzards in Chicago. Earthquakes in Laurel Canyon."</TE>
<TE>   Now fire. The primal element.</TE>
<TE>   The Martinezes never gave fire a second thought when they moved
here. Few of their neighbors did either. In fact, no one believed a
fire could grow so big and fast by feeding on the forests south of
town.</TE>
<TE>   Tony and Joyce paid roughly $300,000 for their house, Tony said,
and the insurance company told them Tuesday that they would get a
check for $530,000 if it burned to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a check like that," Tony said, standing in the garage,
looking around, "I'm going to Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Joyce, meanwhile, was upstairs, keeping her focus on the task at
hand. She stood before a closet of blouses and dresses that belonged
to her daughter, a flight attendant, and frowned.</TE>
<TE>   "She'll never forgive me if I let all this burn," she said of her
daughter. "I've got to take all this."</TE>
<TE>   She wheeled and looked at the bedding, the bureau, the piles of
clothes everywhere. How was it all going to fit in that Ford?</TE>
<TE>   "I want to take my whole house," she moaned, spreading her arms
wide, cupping her palms, miming the gesture of ripping the house off
its footings.</TE>
<TE>   Each time she raced down the stairs with another load of stuff,
Joyce shot a glance at the American flag across the street--her
weathervane. "As long as it blows that way we're fine," she said.
"When it turns around, we're gone."</TE>
<TE>   When the wind turned around, she explained, the fire would be
right behind it.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a few streets away, Jay Smith and Steve Zablocki were
standing on the sidewalk, alternating between watching the wind and
watching a neighbor's son go back and forth on a motorized scooter.</TE>
<TE>   "I packed all my IRS stuff," Zablocki said, chuckling. "They
wouldn't believe me if I told them my house burned up."</TE>
<TE>   Besides important documents, Smith said, he and his wife were
taking some watercolors painted by her grandfather, and some
sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's wife and children had already fled the neighborhood, he
said. He decided to move them Monday when he saw his son playing
outside and noticed that his face and mouth were covered with soot
and ash.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife's crying every 30 minutes," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Zablocki and his wife, however, were waiting for the official
order to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, Julie Moore was running back and forth between
her truck and her house, her cheeks flushed.</TE>
<TE>   "I just bought half a cow," she said. "And I didn't want it to go
bad [in the freezer]. So I came back for it."</TE>
<TE>   Monday, she'd packed her important valuables. But Tuesday, she'd
come back for the cow, and a few other things she hated to lose. Like
her husband's leather tool belt. And two solid silver floor lamps
from the 1920s. And her teddy bear, Theodore, which she'd had since
she was 5 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Before driving away, she walked through her house, trying to
reassure it.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept telling it: 'I'll see you tomorrow. I'll be back
tomorrow.' "</TE>
<TE>   At the Martinez house, Joyce wasn't comforting the walls, but she
was muttering to the garden.</TE>
<TE>   "I put so much work into this yard," she said, standing in the
smoky sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   It showed. The yard was a full palette of colors. Everywhere were
blooming roses, big as apples. Some were scarlet red, others were the
color of fresh cream, and a few were a pale shade of peach. One
purple rose, her favorite, smelled like grape juice.</TE>
<TE>   Here and there was a bright green dwarf pine, surrounded by rocks
Joyce and Tony had scavenged from the mountains. He liked the gray
ones; she preferred the pink.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, along the borders of the garden, Joyce had planted red,
white and blue flower seeds, hoping for a thriving, patriotic garden
in time for the Fourth of July. She looked at the garden, memorizing
every detail, or else imagining it all black.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to clip some roses and bring them inside," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she couldn't get to everything. Now it was time to go.</TE>

<HD>INS Reportedly Begins Inspecting Yemenis' Baggage More
Closely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service has told agents to inspect
baggage belonging to Yemeni citizens for large sums of money, thermos
bottles and night-vision goggles, a government official said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Agents were instructed to thoroughly search baggage belonging to
Yemenis entering and leaving the U.S., the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   A recent raid on an apartment in the Northeast where a number of
Yemenis lived netted thermos bottles outfitted with wires and
batteries, the official said.</LD>
<TE>   An INS spokesman declined to say whether Yemenis were being
subjected to more thorough searches, though he confirmed such
searches take place.</TE>
<TE>   "We do at times conduct these heightened levels of inspection
activities when provided intelligence or investigative information
either that we've developed ourselves or that has been provided to
us," said Russell Bergeron, the spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Yemenis carrying diplomatic passports were exempt from the INS
searches, CBS News said.</TE>

<HD>Water Spigots for Yucca Mountain Will Remain Closed, Judge
Orders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>A federal judge refused Tuesday to turn on the water at the proposed
Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository site, saying the U.S.
government has enough water to last until Congress makes a decision
on the project.</LD>
<LD>   The state, which is trying to block the repository, has shut off
water to the facility, and the U.S. asked the judge to intervene.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. District Judge Roger Hunt chided the government for
seeking what federal lawyer Stephen Bartell called an "anticipatory
injunction" in case water runs low at the arid site 90 miles
northwest of Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Bartell told the judge the site has 114,850 gallons of drinking
water stored but added: "We don't feel we should have to wait until
the very last drop of water is used to seek relief from the courts."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt said that if the Yucca Mountain project runs low, the U.S.
can return to court and he will hear the case immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt noted that the government has water in a 1-million-gallon
tank at the site and can draw from tanks storing up to 400,000
gallons at the surrounding Nevada Test Site. The water is sufficient
to last "well beyond July," Hunt said, a reference to the July 26
deadline for the Senate to vote to override the state's veto of the
proposed repository.</TE>

<HD>Sea Route to Rival Silk Road Found</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Spices, textiles and remains of ships show that
Egyptian port of Berenike was a key link between India and the Middle
East.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New excavations at the Egyptian Red Sea port of Berenike show that an
extensive sea trade existed between India and the Middle East from
the 3rd century BC to the 7th century AD, supplementing the much more
widely known Silk Road.</LD>
<LD>   Large quantities of spices, textiles and other exotic materials
were offloaded at Berenike, carried by camel train across the Arabian
Desert to the Nile and then shipped by boat to the Mediterranean port
of Alexandria and throughout the Roman Empire, according to
researchers from UCLA and the University of Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   "The sea route between India and Egypt appears to be more
productive than we ever imagined," said UCLA archeologist Willeke
Wendrich, who co-led the expedition.</LD>
<TE>   Ship remains found at the site, furthermore, indicate that the
vessels were built in India and most likely crewed by Indians.</TE>
<TE>   "This turns around our way of viewing the world at that time,"
Wendrich said. "We are used to looking at it from the point of view
of the Roman Empire, but clearly a lot of the initiative was on the
Indian side. It was not a one-way trade initiated by Rome."</TE>
<TE>   Berenike "is one of those really productive finds," said
archeologist Stanley Burstein of Cal State LA, who was not involved
in the research. "Most of the [artifacts] are not spectacular, but
they are revolutionary in improving our understanding of how this
trade worked."</TE>
<TE>   Berenike--sometimes also called Berenice--was founded in 275 BC by
Pharaoh Ptolemy II, who named it after his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Its original purpose was for the importation of war elephants from
Africa, but its uses rapidly expanded.</TE>
<TE>   It was a natural harbor, protected from the prevailing northern
winds by the Ras Banas peninsula and far from the pirates operating
from the Arabian Peninsula. Its chief drawback was the lack of
locally produced food and water. Food had to be imported from the
Nile Valley, about 200 miles away, and water from wells five miles
outside town.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the city flourished for nearly 900 years before being
abandoned for reasons that are not yet clear. Fortunately for
archeologists, no other settlements were built on the ruins, and the
city's remote location protected it from looting. The site is also
strategically located in a military district near the Sudanese
border, and access was strictly limited until recently.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a part of the world that was isolated and about which
very little was known," said archeologist Donald White of the
University of Pennsylvania's University Museum. The Berenike
excavations "have been able to open our eyes about the nature of
trade between the Far East and the classical world."</TE>
<TE>   Wendrich and Steven Sidebotham of Delaware have been working at
the site since they were given permission by Egypt's Supreme Council
on Antiquities in 1994, and their most recent findings are in a
report to be published today in the journal Sahara.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised by the sheer quantity of things," Wendrich
said. One notable finding involved peppercorns, a valuable Indian
spice widely used in the Roman Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Excavations at other sites have often yielded small quantities of
peppercorns, she noted--five at one site, 14 at another and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   Through 1999, the team had found about 1,600 peppercorns at
Berenike. Then they found a pot containing 16 pounds of the spice.
"If you find it in the trash, and large quantities are stored there,
then the amount transported through the town must have been
mind-boggling," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The discarded peppercorns indicate the prosperity of the
community, Wendrich noted. That prosperity was also reflected in the
discovery of lavish tapestries, imported marble and "very nice"
glassware from Alexandria.</TE>
<TE>   The team also found substantial quantities of teak, which grows in
India and is not indigenous to Egypt. "You'd expect to find woods
native to Egypt, like mangrove and acacia, but the largest amount of
wood we found at Berenike was teak," Sidebotham said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the teak was clearly recycled material from ships that had
worn out or been damaged beyond repair. The team also found materials
consistent with ship-patching, including copper nails and metal
sheeting.</TE>
<TE>   The region's dry climate preserved organic material from India,
including sailcloth dated to AD 30 to 70, basketry and matting. In a
dump from Roman times, the team found Indian coconuts and batik cloth
from the 1st century, as well as an array of exotic gems, including
sapphires, as well as glass beads that appear to have come from Sri
Lanka and carnelian beads from India.</TE>
<TE>   They also found the remains of cereal and animals indigenous to
sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting the possibility of a three-point trade
route that took goods from southern Africa to India and then back
across the Indian Ocean to Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Berenike was long thought to have been abandoned in the 3rd or 4th
centuries, primarily because Greek and Latin texts did not mention it
after that.</TE>
<TE>   "But we found that, in the 4th century, there was an enormous boom
in activity," Wendrich said. "The town was completely rebuilt and
expanded," probably by the Byzantine Empire.</TE>

<HD>Harrington Claims Agent Was Negligent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Colorado Rockies' No. 1 pick in the 2000 draft is suing his
former agent for negligence in California State Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Pitcher Matt Harrington, selected seventh overall out of Palmdale
High, alleges that agent Tommy Tanzer advised him to hold out for a
$4.95-million bonus because the Rockies would never withdraw their
original offer of $4 million.</LD>
<LD>   When the Rockies removed their offer, Harrington re-entered the
draft in 2001. After turning down $1.2 million from the San Diego
Padres in May, he was selected by Tampa Bay in the 13th round of the
2002 draft last week.</LD>
<TE>   Harrington, who fired Tanzer last year and replaced him with agent
Scott Boras, has pitched in independent leagues the last two seasons.
His stock among baseball scouts fell considerably because of a drop
off in his fastball and a lack of competition.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington's suit claims that Tanzer's advice to reject Colorado's
$4-million offer was "negligent and reckless" in light of the market
for draft picks at the time. He seeks unspecified damages.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody had a crystal ball, but an 18-year-old kid has every right
to rely on the advice of his representative," said Jeffrey Metzger,
Harrington's attorney. "Mr. Tanzer provided advice. The Harringtons
relied on it, and it was terribly inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Tanzer's attorney, Alan Milstein, said the complaint is without
merit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so bare-bones and vague, it's almost incomprehensible to
anyone who knows this business," Milstein said. "We're going to
vigorously defend Tommy's reputation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay Devil Ray left-hander Nick Bierbrodt, a former Millikan
High standout, was upgraded to good condition and moved out of
intensive care at the Medical University of South Carolina four days
after being shot in his right arm and chest in Charleston, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   "He's improved significantly the last 24 hours," Dr. David Cole
said. "It seems like everything is moving rapidly in the right
direction. He's in good spirits."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Met second baseman Roberto Alomar was not in the starting
lineup Tuesday against the Chicago White Sox because of a sprained
left knee. Alomar might be back in the lineup today, although Met
Manager Bobby Valentine said he could be tempted to give him another
day to rest.... Struggling reliever Keith Foulke has lost his
closer's job with the Chicago White Sox and will do some setup work
in an effort to regain his form. Foulke, one of the AL's top closers
the last two years, is 0-4 with only eight saves this season, the
last on May 25. After saving a career-high 42 games and blowing only
three chances all of last year, he's already failed in two save
situations this season.... The Minnesota Twins traded minor league
second baseman Warren Morris to the St. Louis Cardinals for a player
to be named. Morris was batting .261 for triple-A Edmonton in the
Pacific Coast League and will be assigned to the Cardinals' Memphis
triple-A affiliate.</TE>

<HD>Glavine Wins 11th for Braves</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Tom Glavine and the Atlanta Braves got something different at the
Metrodome--a victory.</LD>
<LD>   Glavine became the second 11-game winner in the majors Tuesday
night, giving up two hits over seven scoreless innings to lead the
Braves past the Minnesota Twins, 11-0.</LD>
<LD>   "Glavine was Glavine," Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said. "To pitch a
two-hit shutout in this park is saying something."</LD>
<TE>   Andruw Jones, Vinny Castilla and Matt Franco hit consecutive home
runs in a seven-run fifth inning and Keith Lockhart and Javy Lopez
also homered for the Braves, who have won 13 of 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we finally won a game in this darn place," Glavine said.</TE>
<TE>   He and John Smoltz are the only holdovers from Atlanta's 1991
team, which lost a thrilling seven-game World Series to the Twins
that year.</TE>
<TE>   A game in June can't make up for an October disappointment, but
Glavine was pleased with his performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are nice memories for me," Glavine said. "That was a fun
series to be a part of, but with me and Smoltz being the only two
guys left from that team, it's lost some of its luster."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota won all four of its home games in the '91 series and
then defeated the Braves, 6-5, in 15 innings Monday night--the first
regular season meeting between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   But Glavine (11-2), having one of the best seasons of his 16-year
career, gave Atlanta its first-ever victory in Minneapolis. He struck
out two, walked one, won his sixth consecutive start and trails
Arizona's Curt Schilling, who leads the majors with 12 wins.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine's earned-run average on the road is an astounding 0.71.</TE>

<TE>   Beggar man: Tyson's polite request for a rematch reveals that he

the ridiculous national sundae we've been pigging out on for weeks.

<TE>   Media darling: A writer from the New York Post was frustrated that
her credential for Game 3 of the NBA Finals couldn't be found.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's responsible?" she wanted to know. "Because there will be
repercussions."</TE>
<TE>   Chilling words, considering the source. The writer is Victoria

<TE>   Not so classic: Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News
doesn't think much of baseball's interleague play:</TE>
<TE>   "Colorado-Toronto sounds great if it's hockey, and it might have
been. But it's baseball, so it's a marketing stunt, and a dumb one.</TE>
<TE>   "As I study my Rockies' schedule, I notice that the impending
Cleveland and New York Yankee visits to Coors Field already have been
designated as 'Classic Games,' not only a premature judgment but a
shameless scam.</TE>
<TE>   "There might be a Fall Classic, maybe even at Coors one of these

<HD>Course Credit Not a Black or White Matter</HD>
<DH>Controversy: Golf Digest Now Says Burbeck, Not Tillinghast,
Designed Open Site</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARYANN HUDSON HARVEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The golf purists of America, not an official organization but
nonetheless a serious group of hackers in their own right, were set
on edge recently when a popular golf magazine declared that one of
the finest courses in the country was designed by an ordinary guy
named Joe.</LD>
<LD>   The Black Course at Bethpage in Farmingdale, N.Y., site of this
week's U.S. Open, has always been credited to Albert Warren "A.W."
Tillinghast, a pre-World War II visionary whose masterpieces include
Winged Foot in New York, Baltusrol in New Jersey and the San
Francisco Golf Club. No one is disputing that Tillinghast designed
those, or any of the other 70-plus courses for which he is credited.</LD>
<LD>   The evolvement of the Black Course, though, was a bit more
complicated. The Black is one of four courses at Bethpage State Park
on Long Island that were built by hundreds of workers during the
Depression as a Works Relief project. A fifth course was built later.
You would think there would be an abundance of bureaucratic paperwork
somewhere, but apparently, there isn't. What we do know is that
Joseph H. Burbeck, longtime superintendent of Bethpage State Park,
oversaw this massive project under Robert Moses, who, as New York
State Parks commissioner, built many of the highways, dams and parks
in the state.</LD>
<TE>   It is Burbeck's son, Joe Burbeck, who brought forth the claim that
his father designed all four Depression-era courses at Bethpage--the
Black, Blue, Red and Green courses. "You did not mention the name of
A.W. Tillinghast in our house," Joe Burbeck, now 71, said last week
from his home near Rye, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "They said Tillinghast designed all four courses, but my family
knew that was not the case. My mother [Elizabeth] would not have lied
to her only son about this."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Burbeck Sr. never claimed credit for the courses, nor did he
ever tell his son that he designed them, his son says. Mindful of his
parent's memory, though, son Joe wrote to Golf Digest with the claim.
After researching the matter, Golf Digest agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We always deal with who was the architect of record, and, in the
official 'The History of the Long Island State Parks' it states that
the courses were designed and constructed by Joseph H. Burbeck with
A.W. Tillinghast as consultant," said Ron Whitten, who wrote the May
article for Golf Digest. "I'm surprised at the turmoil this has
caused. I've been taken to task through e-mails and calls. The
implication to some is that I'm diminishing the course or
Tillinghast, but I'm not. It doesn't change the quality of the
course."</TE>
<TE>   The news stunned Philip Young, who recently published, "Golf for
the People, Bethpage and the Black."</TE>
<TE>   "My whole life is the Tillinghast course and, in my research, I
came across the name Burbeck only three times," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Young, the 1959 history of Long Island state parks
that Whitten cited was a reprint from an article originally published
in the Long Island Forum magazine in June 1942, written by Chester
Blakelock, then executive secretary of the Long Island State Park
Commission. "Whitten bases his conclusion on one very tenuous mention
in an article written in 1942," Young said. "I don't see how they can
say that, from now on, Golf Digest will give credit to Burbeck."</TE>
<TE>   Few were more surprised at Whitten's conclusion than golf
architect Rees Jones, who prepared the Black for this week's
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Every golf course has a combination of people, and I'm sure that
some of Burbeck's ideas are in there too," Jones said by telephone
last week. "But Tillinghast was the architect. The layout is so
spectacular, and so natural and so well done, I can't believe an
amateur could do it."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Burbeck wrote to Jones before writing to Golf Digest, asking
him to check the Black Course blueprints for his father's name. But
there are no blueprints, no sketchbook, no record of the design,
Jones says. There's no one to ask. Joe Burbeck Sr. died in 1987.
Tillinghast died in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf course architecture is a craft, and you need someone with
experience to tell you what to do and how to do it," Jones said.
"Plus there are so many Tillinghast characteristics, some very much
like Pine Valley, which Tillinghast worked on," he added, referring
to the great course in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Whitten produced other circumstantial evidence showing Burbeck as
the designer, but nearly all of it is open to interpretation. He
found that Tillinghast's contract to design the courses was for a
period of 15 days at $50 a day, which, Whitten concluded, was not
enough time to design four golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   Jones disagrees. "There were a lot of courses Donald Ross never
saw, but he sent his people," Jones said of one of the nation's
premier course architects and a contemporary of Tillinghast.</TE>
<TE>   Young, and other researchers of all-things-Tillinghast have their
own circumstantial evidence--again subject to interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   The Tillinghast Assn. offers writings about Bethpage by
Tillinghast that appeared in Golf Illustrated, for which Tillinghast
was editor for one year.</TE>
<TE>   "Tillinghast even wrote that he was pleased with the enthusiasm
and support he got from Burbeck," said Rick Wolffe, who has helped
publish some of Tillinghast's writings.</TE>
<TE>   Young says he will peruse the files of the Robert Moses archives
after the Open, looking for correspondence between Tillinghast and
Moses--searching for Tillinghast's precise role. Said Jones, son of
renowned architect Robert Trent Jones: "I think the reason
Tillinghast was called a consultant is at that time in the
Depression, it was a make-work program, and you couldn't hire a
big-time designer. I know that during that time my dad did work and
didn't get paid."</TE>
<TE>   Burbeck has his own views on why Tillinghast was hired. "My dad
thought Robert Moses walked on water and if Robert Moses was going to
say that Tillinghast was the designer, then my father would go with
that," Burbeck said. "His name was there because Robert Moses needed
a major golf complex and here he had an inside guy, a park
superintendent doing the work, and what if it didn't work out and was
a fiasco? So he attached a famous golf course architect to its name."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Bethpage remain steadfast that Tillinghast is the
designer and say they have no reason to remove Tillinghast's name as
Black Course architect.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, Burbeck will take his daughter and her husband to
the Open, where they will walk the Black. Joe Burbeck says he has a
few stories about the place he wants to tell them. "I'm sure some
minds won't be changed," Burbeck said. "You don't mess with Mr.
Tillinghast. But I'm satisfied I've done everything I can do. I'm
satisfied the evidence is there."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brown Status Up in the Air After Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The doctor who performed surgery on a herniated disk in Kevin Brown's
lower back said Tuesday he was "guarded" about the chances of the
Dodger ace pitching again this season.</LD>
<LD>   During a two-hour procedure at USC Medical Center, Robert Watkins
removed a large herniation--they are classified as small, medium or
large--and "a large number of fragments [that were] compressing the
nerve."</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who was already on the disabled list because of
inflammation in his surgically repaired right elbow, will begin a
five-step rehabilitation program to stabilize the trunk area in about
two weeks. He will not be allowed to pick up a baseball until his
rehab is complete.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no reason to think he won't return at 100%," Watkins
said. "[But] I would be guarded in any recommendation that he can
return this year. I'm going to take it one week at a time.... His
response to the program will determine how rapidly he comes back."</TE>
<TE>   Recovery time varies from patient to patient, but Brown, in the
fourth year of a seven-year, $105-million contract, will be sidelined
for at least another month and probably more. Though it might not
have any bearing on his recovery, Tuesday's procedure was not
considered routine.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little out of the ordinary because it was a foramenal
herniation, meaning [it was located] in the window, the tunnel, that
the nerve goes out of," Watkins said. "That's not as common as a
typical herniation into the spinal cord. To take it out, we came
through the window of the spine, which isn't normal."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who said he suffered the injury while playfully wrestling
with his son May 29, will remain hospitalized until tonight or
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   There could be one benefit to Brown's back surgery--the down time
could allow his elbow to further heal. Some speculated that Brown
rushed his return from Sept. 27 surgery to repair a torn tendon,
possibly leading to his two elbow setbacks this season. If that's the
case, the Dodgers seem determined not to let that happen again.</TE>
<TE>   "When the time is right [for Brown to return] it will be right;
we'll be very patient, very conservative," General Manager Dan Evans
said. "Independent of any needs we have as a club, we need to have
him back at 100%."</TE>
<TE>   The words "patient" and "conservative" do not jibe with Brown's
aggressive approach, but Evans said he has had numerous conversations
with Brown, stressing the importance of letting the rehabilitation
run its course.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said the Dodgers had no plans to pursue starting pitching
any more vigorously before the July 31 trading deadline, but that was
before Omar Daal, Brown's replacement, gave up nine runs in 4 1/3
innings Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to make decisions like that today," Evans said. "We
know we're not going to have [Brown] for a while, but the depth of
our pitching staff gives us a chance to win every day. We'll get him
back when he's ready. We're not gonna worry about time frame."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are close to an agreement with James Loney on a
signing bonus that is expected to pay the Texas high school first
baseman $1.4-$1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are also close to signing Anaheim Esperanza High
pitcher Greg Miller, a supplemental pick between the first and second
rounds. Miller, the 31st overall pick, is expected to sign for about
$1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Third-round pick Michael Nixon, a high school catcher from Phoenix
who was recruited to play defensive back at UCLA, signed for
$950,000, to be paid out over five years. The deal prohibits Nixon
from playing football.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-round pick Delwyn Young, a second baseman from Santa
Barbara City College, is close to signing for $250,000. Fifth-round
pick Michael Megrew, a high school pitcher from Rhode Island, has
signed for $190,000, and sixth-round pick Marshall Looney, a high
school pitcher from Oregon, has signed for $150,000.</TE>

<LD>How terrific is Tiger Woods?</LD>
<LD>   There are 17 ways to become exempt for the U.S. Open and Woods has
qualified nine ways. He is exempt for having been a recent winner of
the U.S. Open, Masters, British Open and PGA Championship. He has
also qualified as a result of being a top-15 finisher in last year's
U.S. Open, having finished as one of the top 30 money winners on the
2001 PGA Tour, being among the top 10 money leaders this year through
May 26 and ranking among the top 50 point leaders in the world
rankings list. Woods is also exempt for being a multiple winner of a
PGA Tour co-sponsored event from April 25, 2001, through June 2,
2002.</LD>
<LD>   No other golfer in this year's field has more than six exemptions.</LD>
<TE>   Six of the 17 exemptions don't apply to Woods, as they are awarded
to the 2001 amateur champion, Senior Open winner and various foreign
tour leaders. And Woods certainly didn't need a USGA special
exemption, extended this year to Hale Irwin.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the only exemption available to Woods that he did not
earn was the one awarded to the 2002 Players Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Perks earned his way into this year's Open by winning that
tournament.</TE>

<HD>Germany Sees Red in Victory</HD>
<DH>Group E: A 2-0 win over Cameroon, coming despite playing a
man short for 37 minutes, is ticket to next round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHIZUOKA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Germany's incredible shrinking soccer team, which lost four starters
to injury before the start of the World Cup and another to a red card
in the 40th minute Tuesday against Cameroon, has advanced to the
knockout phase because of the one thing it managed not to lose during
the first round: a game.</LD>
<LD>   Again, Germany drew strength from attrition, backpedaling and
scrambling to keep pace with the fleet Cameroonians until Carsten
Ramelow was ejected for a harsh tackle of Samuel Eto'o. Short-handed
again--nothing new in this tournament--Germany needed only 10 minutes
to score and take control en route to a 2-0 victory.</LD>
<LD>   This was supposed to be the weakest German World Cup team in 40
years, disappointing in the 2000 European Championships and depleted
by injuries that sidelined regulars Mehmet Scholl, Sebastian Deisler,
Dietmar Hamman and Christian Worns before the squad left for Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, Germany finished first in a difficult Group E with a 2-0-1
record, scoring 11 goals and yielding one--to Ireland's Robbie Keane
in the 92nd minute of a 1-1 draw.</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon, the defending Olympic and African champion, was favored
by many to win the group title and duplicate its 1990 quarterfinal
performance. But after taking a quick 1-0 lead in its opener against
Ireland, the Indomitable Lions never seemed to recover from Matt
Holland's second-half equalizer and the subsequent 1-1 draw.</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon struggled to defeat Saudi Arabia, 1-0, days after Germany
had pounded the Saudis for eight goals. And Tuesday, once German
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn had snuffed Salomon Olembe's one-on-one
breakaway attempt in the 13th minute, Cameroon's frustrations began
to spill over, which contributed to a record 16 yellow cards.</TE>
<TE>   A Lion player, Patrick Suffo, also was sent off, after a late
tackle of Michael Ballack in the 77th minute.</TE>
<TE>   It was an ugly affair, fittingly summarized by Cameroon Coach
Winfried Schafer, who blamed his team's defeat on the red card that
had given Cameroon a man advantage for 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "The decisive moment of the match was when Ramelow got a red
card," Schafer said. "I would have preferred it if he'd stayed on the
field and Olembe had scored."</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes after Ramelow left, substitute Marco Bode gave Germany
a 1-0 lead, taking a feed from Miroslav Klose and sliding the ball
past the diving effort of goalkeeper Boukar Alioum.</TE>
<TE>   In the 79th minute, Klose made it 2-0 with a header on a cross
from Ballack. Klose, who scored a hat trick against Saudi Arabia,
leads the tournament with five goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my players they had to work more, because 10 players on
the field, instead of 11, tend to grow wings, as they say," Schafer
said. "Cameroon did it at the Olympic Games. It is something that
happens in the head."</TE>
<TE>   Germany will next face the second-place finisher in Group B,
Spain, South Africa or Paraguay. The Germans will begin that one with
11 men on the field.</TE>

<LD>Besides enriching her connections and those who bet on her at 17-1,
Ragin T Rex's upset victory in the Manhattan Beach Stakes on Sunday
proved beneficial in another way.</LD>
<LD>   The third consecutive win by the daughter of Cat's Career helped
guarantee a pick-six carryover for today, so $200,095 awaits players
this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   If not for the carryover, there would have been little to get
excited about on the program except for the seventh race, a $62,000
allowance at 1 1/16 miles on the turf.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly half of the nine entrants in the contest have won either a
Grade I or a Group I race and four others have won a graded stakes of
some kind.</TE>
<TE>   Riviera, who won the Grade I Atto Mile at Woodbine in 2000, is the
likely favorite. After losing twice down the hill at Santa Anita, a
course he has adored in the past, the 8-year-old son of Kris
rebounded nicely when he moved to Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   After tracking the pace, Riviera and jockey Kent Desormeaux
finished well and won by two lengths over Little Ghazi, who is in the
field again today.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Riviera, the other horses with a Grade I or Group I
victory are Straight Flush, who won two Group I races in his native
Brazil; Tapatio, who won the Group I Gran Premio Nacional in
Argentina, and Big Board, who won the Group I Gran Premio San Isidro
in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth is a good allowance sprint (6 1/2
furlongs) that attracted nine fillies and mares.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Doug O'Neill. The trainer has won with eight of 37
starters at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: John Morrison. The New York-based trainer is 0 for 30
in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Nicky's Intuition in
the fifth, using Road Test, Chin Gone and Rasty in the sixth and
Riviera, Dr. Park and Straight Flush in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/95. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $8.40/$543. Total money bet: $604.</TE>

<HD>Irish Eyes Smiling After Win</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>The green-shirted legions faithfully followed their team across the
width of Japan, from Niigata to Ibaraki to Yokohama, waiting and
hoping to finally see an Ireland victory, waiting and hoping to
finally see more than one Irish goal in a match.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday, at last, they found everything they were looking for--a
3-0 Irish victory over Saudi Arabia at Yokohama International Stadium
and the accompanying berth in the World Cup's second round.</LD>
<LD>   Ireland Coach Mick McCarthy said he hoped the supporters liked the
show, because in his opinion, even those in the upper reaches of the
stadium had a better seat than he did.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody has been telling us all week what a big game it is,"
McCarthy said. "You want to try sitting in the dugout when your
backside is in the bacon slicer? It's all right for everybody
else--they can enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy looked like a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown in
the first half, knowing his team needed at least two goals to clinch
automatic second-round qualification, and watching his players
squander repeated chances for a second after Robbie Keane had given
Ireland a 1-0 lead in the 10th minute.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very nervous," McCarthy said. "It was a big game for us
and I think frustration on the pitch, off the pitch, from the
sidelines, affected us. We started trying to chase the game and get
that other goal."</TE>
<TE>   After trying to "settle people down" at halftime, McCarthy watched
his team break through with the goal it needed--Gary Breen slipping
between two Saudi defenders to knock in Kevin Kilbane's free kick in
the 61st minute.</TE>
<TE>   Damien Duff provided the clincher in the 87th minute.</TE>
<TE>   It amounted to a windfall for the Irish, who had tied their first
two games, against Cameroon and Germany, by 1-1 scores. With five
points at 1-0-2, Ireland finished in second place in Group E behind
Germany and will next face the winner of Group B, either Spain or
South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, it will be Spain, a possibility that drew a mixed
reaction from Ireland's players.</TE>
<TE>   "They are terrific," midfielder Matt Holland said. "I hate to play
against a great team."</TE>
<TE>   Captain Steve Staunton begged to differ.</TE>
<TE>   "Bring on the Spanish," he said. "We like playing the big boys.
That is what the World Cup is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia (0-3) finished last in Group E. They were outscored,
12-0, which left Coach Nasser Al Johar with some explaining to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not satisfied with the way we played," Al Johar said. "Saudi
was not good enough, but France got knocked out without scoring a
goal."</TE>
<TE>   Looking for similarities between his team and the 1998 world
champions, Al Johar finally found one.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Is Pivotal to Italy's Itinerary</HD>
<DH>Group G: A loss on Thursday would mean arrivederci to the
three-time World Cup champion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>When Hernan Cortez set off to conquer Mexico nearly 500 years ago, he
first ordered his men to burn their ships on the eastern coast,
vividly driving home the point that there would be no turning back.
Now that was a do-or-die match.</LD>
<LD>   Giovanni Trapattoni has never been compared to Cortez, not by the
Italian soccer media anyway, but as his Italy team prepared to head
south for its own must-win encounter against Mexico, workers were
already dismantling Italy's World Cup training base at Sendai.</LD>
<LD>   The message was none too subliminal:</LD>
<TE>   Beat Mexico or else.</TE>
<TE>   For Italy, which first landed on these shores with expectations of
reaching the World Cup final, the situation has turned surprisingly
dire, thanks to either a Danish linesman robbing the Italians of two
goals in a 2-1 loss to Croatia (that's Trapattoni's version) or
Trapattoni mismanaging Italy's usual wealth of talent (that's the
Italian media's version).</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the cause, this is the scenario: Mexico, victorious in
its first two World Cup matches for the first time, leads Group G
with six points. Italy, three points back at 1-1, needs to defeat
Mexico on Thursday at Oita to assure passage to the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Lose and the Italians are on the next flight back to Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Tie and the Italians will be praying for an Ecuador upset of
Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   Winning is the only way three-time World Cup champion Italy can
guarantee a trip to South Korea for a second-round match against
South Korea, the United States or Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "We must qualify and go to Korea," says Franco Carraro, president
of the Italian Football Federation. "Frankly, if we don't beat
Mexico, we are mediocre.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure we will qualify."</TE>
<TE>   At the Mexico camp, Coach Javier Aguirre was trying to assure
reporters that, no, his team wouldn't be playing it safe and playing
for the tie--Mexico advances with one more point--and, yes, his team
plans to play Italy honestly and go for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Mexico has proceeded through the tournament with the kind
of pragmatism Italy adopted years ago: Defend until the other guys
drop, get a lead and drop eight men back, get the result.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico played this tactic to textbook form in its opener against
Croatia, circling the wagons in front of goalkeeper Oscar Perez,
getting a 60th-minute penalty kick from Cuauhtemoc Blanco and
grinding out a 1-0 decision.</TE>
<TE>   More improvisation was needed in Sunday's match against Ecuador,
once Ecuador took a 1-0 lead in the fifth minute. Controlling the
ball in deep midfield and picking their spots to push forward, the
Mexicans equalized on a running volley by Jared Borgetti, waited some
more, and went ahead on an unexpected surge and strike by central
midfielder Gerardo Torrado, usually a defensive specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Torrado's tiebreaker came in the 57th minute, almost too early,
requiring the Mexican defense to hold on for a tense half an hour as
Ecuador pressed hard.</TE>
<TE>   Italy opened with a predictable 2-0 triumph over Ecuador, getting
two quick goals from Christian Vieri, then falling back in droves to
preserve them. The Italians figured to dispatch Croatia similarly,
but Croatia Coach Mirko Jozic juggled his lineup and surprised Italy
by fielding a younger, quicker squad.</TE>
<TE>   Stung for two goals, Italy had two of its own disallowed by Danish
linesman Jens Larsen. First, Larsen nullified a header by Vieri,
claiming the striker was offside, a decision replays dispute. Then
Larsen cited Filippo Inzaghi for shirt-grabbing en route to a
potential late equalizer.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico and Italy have played only twice in the World Cup. Italy
won a quarterfinal match, 4-1, in 1970. The teams tied, 1-1, in a
group match in 1994. That year, Mexico won the group, but Italy
advanced to the final.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their predicament, the Italians continue to talk of a
return trip in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Cup is the World Cup," Italy defender Christian Panucci
said. "There is always pressure and it is normal to have to get a
result in the last game to qualify. That's the way it is.</TE>
<TE>   "But I have absolute [confidence] that we can go a long way."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Wanted: Yankees at Edison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With attendance down despite the best start in franchise history, the
Angels have asked major league officials to provide a more attractive
home schedule next season.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, the Angels have requested the New York Yankees play
two series in Anaheim next year. The unbalanced schedule prevents
American League teams outside the AL West from visiting Anaheim more
than once every season, but the Yankees played just one series at
Edison Field last year and will do so again this year.</LD>
<LD>   And, with AL West teams expected to face National League East
opponents during interleague play next season, the Angels would love
to play the New York Mets at Edison Field. While interleague play
might generate attendance increases when the Dodgers visit Edison
Field and the Yankees face the Mets, just slapping the "interleague"
tag on the stadium marquee does not guarantee fan interest. On a
beautiful evening, the Angels drew 17,755 for Tuesday's game against
the Pittsburgh Pirates.</LD>
<TE>   "If we're going to have interleague play, we need to have more
geographically inclined rivalries," Pittsburgh Manager Lloyd
McClendon said. "I don't see the rivalry between the Anaheim Angels
and the Pittsburgh Pirates."</TE>
<TE>   If the Mets played at Edison Field, Mo Vaughn would come along,
and what fun that could be for Angel fans who grew weary of the
slugger's oft-stated desire to return to the East Coast. Vaughn,
traded to the Mets three years after signing a six-year, $80-million
contract with the Angels, is hitting .233 with four home runs, 21
runs batted in and a .330 slugging percentage. Angel shortstop David
Eckstein is hitting .274 with five homers, 31 RBIs and a .391
slugging percentage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel reliever Al Levine, who complained of irritation in his
pitching shoulder Sunday, was not available Tuesday. An MRI
examination Monday came back normal, and athletic trainer Ned Bergert
said exercises would strengthen the shoulder and medication would
reduce inflammation. Levine is unlikely to appear before Friday's
series opener against the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are the only AL team to use only five starters this
season, but they will not hold that distinction much longer. The
Angels play a doubleheader against the Texas Rangers on June 24,
during a stretch of 14 games in 13 days. They are expected to promote
Matt Wise or John Lackey from triple-A Salt Lake City to start one of
the games of the doubleheader. Wise, whose turn in the Salt Lake
rotation comes closest to June 24, is 2-0 with a 1.47 earned-run
average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel catcher Bengie Molina leads the American League by throwing
out 51% of would-be base stealers. His brother Jose, catcher at Salt
Lake, leads the Pacific Coast League by throwing out 59% of runners.</TE>

<KH>U.S. OPEN THURSDAY-SUNDAY, BETHPAGE BLACK COURSE</KH>
<HD>This Looks Like a Setup for Woods</HD>
<DH>Golf: Making course longer and tougher would seem to
shorten odds for the favorite, who is going for second leg of Grand
Slam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Is this U.S. Open an open-and-shut case for Tiger Woods? Better get
ready, because that's what it's shaping up to be.</LD>
<LD>   Start with the designer. If he was supposed to Tiger-proof
Bethpage Black, then Rees Jones did a lousy job. But Jones, who
reworked this woodsy Long Island course to get it ready for the U.S.
Open, had no such mission. He only wanted to make it longer and
tougher, which are two conditions that suit exactly whom?</LD>
<LD>   "Tiger, of course," Jones said.</LD>
<TE>   It's not that Jones tailored the course to suit Woods, either, but
when the 102nd U.S. Open begins Thursday at the Black Course at
Bethpage State Park, Woods' chances couldn't be much better. His
power advantage off the tee is so great that he should be hitting
shorter clubs than anyone else into the hard greens, which means he
has a better chance of preventing his golf balls from rolling off.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a small edge, says Jose Maria Olazabal.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, for Tiger, to hit the ball long is going to be crucial on
this golf course because you need the short irons to those greens."</TE>
<TE>   Now consider the setup. The two longest par-four holes in U.S.
Open history are among the first three holes Woods will play
Thursday--the 492-yard 10th and the 499-yard 12th. But during his
practice round Tuesday, Woods hit driver and six-iron on No. 10 and
driver and a five-iron on No. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Said Woods: "It's going to be tough to get off to a positive
start, but you're going to have to, somehow."</TE>
<TE>   It's the same drill for everybody. Bethpage Black measures 7,214
yards--the longest U.S. Open course ever--and plays to a par of 70.
The record shows that Woods is 0 for 8 in majors on a par-70 course.</TE>
<TE>   The list includes the 1997 U.S. Open at Congressional in Bethesda,
Md. (tie for 19th), and the PGA Championship at Winged Foot in
Mamaroneck, N.Y. (tie for 29th); the 1998 U.S. Open at the Olympic
Club in San Francisco (tie for 18th), British Open at Royal Birkdale
in Southport, England (third), and PGA Championship at Sahalee in
Redmond, Wash. (tie for 10th); the 1999 U.S. Open at Pinehurst, N.C.
(tie for third); and the 2001 U.S. Open at Southern Hills in Tulsa
(tie for 12th) and PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club (tie for
29th).</TE>
<TE>   If that is supposed to be a statistic bothersome to Woods, he
doesn't sound concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, actually, I think it gives me more of an advantage, to be
honest with you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said if he drives in the fairway, he's going to have shorter
irons into the greens. Shorter irons mean higher trajectory and that
translates into an edge for Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get par-fours over 480 yards like they are here this
week, you are going to have to be able to bring the ball in high," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Merrins, the pro at Bel-Air Country Club, watched Woods
practice Tuesday and said Woods is clearly the player to beat. He
compared Bethpage Black to Baltusrol in Springfield, N.J., where Jack
Nicklaus won the U.S. Open in 1967 and in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Bethpage suits Tiger better than any of the other three
majors this year," Merrins said. "He can spray the ball a little bit
here and still score."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Woods isn't the only power hitter in the U.S.
Open field, just the most dominant. Ernie Els, a two-time U.S. Open
champion, can knock the ball a long way, and so can Phil Mickelson,
Davis Love III, David Duval, Vijay Singh and Sergio Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Move on to what's at stake: Woods is the only player in the field
who has the chance to continue on a Grand Slam pace.</TE>
<TE>   He won the Masters in April and a victory this week would put him
halfway toward a possible Grand Slam with the British Open at
Muirfield in Gullane, Scotland, and the PGA Championship at Hazeltine
in Chaska, Minn., still to come.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says he isn't buying into other peoples' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can do is go out there and play and give it my
best," he said. "Whether that puts higher expectations, I really
don't know. I think that everyone here and the public is going to
have to decide that. I think for my own expectation level, I come to
every tournament to try to win and that's what I'm going to try to do
this week again."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds fair enough.</TE>
<TE>   NBC analyst Johnny Miller says besides Pebble Beach, Bethpage
Black suits Woods more than any other venue for the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think this is an absolute great course for Tiger," Miller
said. "I believe the Open will always be the hardest one for him to
win, but of all the Opens I've seen besides Pebble, this one looks
like it sets up perfectly for his game. Not too much wind, a lot of
forced carries over big bunkers, more room off the tee, the drives
are not tricky or funky.</TE>
<TE>   "The greens, he can handle any greens, but these greens are pretty
benign. They are fast, but they are very, very flat."</TE>
<TE>   Woods is sometimes a streaky putter, but the secret to rolling the
ball successfully at Bethpage Black is to read them correctly, an
area where Woods excels. When he won the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble
Beach, the greens were bumpy, but Woods was able to solve them
nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   So if there is an early indication of what's in store for Woods,
follow his progress on the greens. Everything else, we already know,
or at least think we do.</TE>

<KH>U.S. OPEN NOTES</KH>
<HD>Goosen Didn't Fade Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>He doesn't look, talk or act like a defending U.S. Open champion, but
Retief Goosen knows golf is a game of feel.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah," Goosen admitted Tuesday, "I feel like a defending
champion."</LD>
<LD>   It has been a whirlwind year for the 33-year-old South African,
who staved off a potential career-threatening humiliation last year
when he beat Mark Brooks in a Monday playoff at Southern Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Goosen, of course, should have wrapped up his first major title
the day before, but he three-putted from 12 feet on the 72nd hole to
force a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   While the rest of the world dissected his major faux pas, the
mild-mannered Goosen shrugged his shoulders and got on with his life,
which has gone pretty well since winning the Open.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen, in fact, has become a major player on the European and
American circuits, having earned more than $1 million on each while
climbing to No. 4 in the world rankings behind Tiger Woods, Phil
Mickelson and countryman Ernie Els.</TE>
<TE>   He finished second at this year's Masters, fading down the stretch
at Augusta after playing in the final pairing with the winner, Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen is eager to get another chance Sunday against Woods, winner
of six of the last 10 major titles.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it probably would be ideal, to be there on Sunday playing
against him and trying to beat him," Goosen said. "That's what it's
all about."</TE>
<TE>   Goosen says he thinks the Bethpage Black Course is "probably going
to be the toughest test we are going to see in U.S. Open history."</TE>
<TE>   It may well come down to the 72nd hole Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm really keen and going to be determined out there to
try to do my best and see if I can hang onto the title," Goosen said.
"It's going to be a tough one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A lot of 16-year-olds receive cars from their parents, but few
kids earn one with a wedge.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Derek Tolan and his dad made a bet. If Tolan qualified
for the U.S. Open, his father would buy him a car.</TE>
<TE>   Guess what? Tolan, from Colorado, chipped in a 50-footer to win a
three-way playoff at sectional qualifying and became the youngest
player in this week's field.</TE>
<TE>   Pay up, Pop.</TE>
<TE>   "We always set little bets like that; not in golf but in
everything," Tolan said. "It was more just a pride thing. But
everyone is hounding him about it. So he'll come up with something.
He's a good guy."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Tolan says he hasn't decided what kind of car he
wants.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, Woods was 19 when he played in his first
major, the 1995 Masters, and he offered Tolan this advice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in high school," Woods said. "This is not high school golf."</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he suspects Tolan will be as nervous as he was back in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Woods tied for 41st at his first Masters, although he was the only
amateur to make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to tell yourself it's just another event," Woods said,
"but that's one of the hardest things to try to overcome when you're
on that first tee."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Woods wins the Open, he will pass $30 million in overall
earnings. Mickelson is the only other player to have passed $20
million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rees Jones, who reworked Bethpage Black for the USGA for no fee,
says he played a practice round at the course recently with former
New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Giuliani's 16-year-old son, Andrew.
Jones paid the $31 greens fee for both.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If it rains as expected tonight and Thursday to soften the course,
Jones says the winning score will be about five or six under par.</TE>

<HD>Tie Earns the Senegalese a Trip to Round of 16</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Senegal, the West African nation that contributed to France's World
Cup downfall by beating it in the opening game of Korea/Japan '02, is
going to the second round.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Bruno Metsu's "Lions of Teranga" clinched their place in the
final 16 Tuesday with a dramatic 3-3 tie against Uruguay in front of
33,681 in Suwon, South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   No clearer example of the "game of two halves" cliche could be
found than this bruising encounter between Africa and South America,
an encounter that prompted Dutch referee Jan Wegereef to whistle 43
fouls and issue 12 yellow cards.</LD>
<TE>   The Senegalese dominated the first 45 minutes, building a 3-0 lead
on goals by midfielder Khalilou Fadiga, on a penalty kick in the 20th
minute, and forward Papa Boupa Diop in the 26th and 38th minutes.</TE>
<TE>   That should have been enough to finish off Uruguay, but the
two-time world champion stormed back in the second half to tie the
score and almost snatch a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo Morales cut the deficit to 3-1 with a goal one minute
after the break; Diego Forlan made it 3-2 in the 69th minute, and
Alvaro Recoba scored on a penalty kick two minutes from the end to
leave Senegalese nerves in tatters. But the Africans held on, if
barely.</TE>
<TE>   "We showed the world that Senegal is a very small country but we
are a very big people," Fadiga said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is really an extraordinary success," Senegal Coach
Bruno Metsu said. "It was engrossing, moving, difficult [match] and
it was a fantastic spectacle."</TE>
<TE>   The result and resulting disappointment was enough to cause
Uruguay Coach Victor Pua to resign immediately after the match.</TE>
<TE>   "With this match, an era ends," Pua said. "It's my decision."</TE>
<TE>   Neither team was happy with the penalty kicks awarded by Wegereef
in the bruising, no-holds-barred match. Uruguay's tying goal
especially was tinged with controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Replays showed Morales falling in the penalty area before Senegal
defender Habib Beye moved to tackle him. But Wegereef failed to spot
the dive and whistled Beye for a foul.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not touch him," Beye said in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Uruguay protested loudly that goalkeeper Fabian Carini
had made no contact with Senegal striker El Hadji Diouf when Diouf
tumbled to the turf in the 20th-minute incident that led to Fadiga's
goal off the resulting penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   The only downbeat note for Senegal, meanwhile, was the second
yellow card picked up by Fadiga, which means he will miss the
second-round game against either Argentina, England or Sweden.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Commissioner David Stern closed his state of the NBA address Tuesday
with the worst possible news for Laker fans: "Thanks for coming, and
enjoy the games."</LD>
<LD>   The gameS?</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers were planning on one more game and going home for the
parade Friday, but when the commissioner mentioned gameS, I
immediately went to the front of the room to see if he was reading
from a prepared script. I thought it might include the final score of
tonight's game, and I think it would be kind of fun to get it in the
paper for a change before the game starts.</LD>
<TE>   "Excuse me, Commissioner," I said, "but you said 'gameS.' Do you
already have it arranged so the series will go beyond Wednesday?"</TE>
<TE>   Stern shook his head as if he had just met the biggest dope in the
world. I hope one day he gets the chance to meet San Diego Charger
owner Alex Spanos.</TE>
<TE>   "If we arranged things," Stern said, "we wouldn't be sitting here
3-0."</TE>
<TE>   I said, "Excuse me, Commissioner, but unlike the sixth game
against Sacramento, maybe the officials didn't read the script," and
Stern repeated what I said: "Maybe the officials didn't read the
script!"</TE>
<TE>   I took that as a confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ASKED Stern if he was concerned some fans think the NBA is
willing to arrange things for TV's benefit, and in return, I got
blah-blah-blah. He must hang around a lot with NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue.</TE>
<TE>   The double talk was an improvement, however, from the two NBA
executives who took off sprinting after Game 6 in Staples Center when
I broached the same subject. They must hang around a lot with USC
Athletic Director Mike Garrett.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to encourage openness in discussing these things," Stern
said, and I said I had Stu Jackson, his vice president of operations,
beating War Emblem by a neck when it looked as if I might try to talk
with him.</TE>
<TE>   Stern peered more closely at my nametag, and I think at that
moment he had a lot more empathy for some of the athletic officials
and athletes in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome to the NBA Finals," he said to me. "It's good to have
you."</TE>
<TE>   Now if the guy can't even tell the truth when he says hello to
you, how can you believe anything he has to say?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STERN SAID things could not be better in the NBA at the current
time, and if anyone thinks poorly about the way the games are
officiated, it's because they've been reading newspaper stories
written by uninformed writers.</TE>
<TE>   Since Diane Pucin wasn't here to defend herself, I argued that
most people watch the games on TV and see the shenanigans for
themselves. All of a sudden I had the commissioner of the NBA trying
to make his case by downplaying the number of people who are watching
NBA playoff games. "Let's see we only had 10 million people watching
... and that's down from ... "</TE>
<TE>   One of the NBA's PR guys interrupted to try to save the
commissioner: "David has another commitment and he's got to run."</TE>
<TE>   I said, "That's a poor choice of words," given my previous
experience with fleeing NBA executives, and Stern picked up on it.
"I've got more time, and I'll stay and discuss whatever you like."
I'll say this: He's got more PR savvy than Tagliabue.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO WHAT about the sixth game of the Sacramento series when the
officials went out of their way to keep the Lakers on TV? The Nets
eliminated the Celtics earlier in the day, and NBC needed a Laker
win, or it wasn't going to have an NBA playoff game
Sunday--diminishing the buildup for the Finals. A Laker win gave NBC
not only a seventh game, but a sure-fire ratings winner.</TE>
<TE>   "If you watch the videotape of Game 6, there were only two or
three bad calls in the whole game," Stern said, and now I was
repeating him in astonishment: "Two or three bad calls in the whole
game!" And Stern said, "Three in the fourth quarter ... "</TE>
<TE>   I think if I could have put him under a spotlight and sweated him
a little, he'd have given up the officials completely.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STERN SAID he's more concerned with coaches criticizing the
referees and the influence that has on fans than any concern he has
for the way the officials work. "That's clear from the ruminations I
hear from our friends in the media," he said, and he was looking
right at me, and I just wonder if he really considers me a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we know it's not [a conspiracy], and we know what's true,
it's a disservice to let some of this go on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me," I said, "then why not stop your NBA executives
running from the media when they're asked questions about
officiating?"</TE>
<TE>   Stern said he would look into it, and knowing his marketing bent,
I could see him promoting a shoe deal appealing to people interested
in running from the media. Imagine the business he could do at USC
alone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS GOOD as the Lakers are and as bad as the Nets are, this series
should end tonight, unless it has to go five or six games.</TE>
<TE>   NBC reportedly needs to reach a fifth game to hit the break-even
mark on what they paid for rights fees, and with ratings already
down, advertising rebates may be in order if a fifth or sixth game
doesn't save the day.</TE>
<TE>   All I know is the commissioner said: "Enjoy the gameS."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Henry Rosebud:</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question if Kobe Bryant is going to show up in the
jersey of the 'greatest,' it will be in Gordie Howe's jersey. What do
you think?"</TE>
<TE>   I was thinking my daughter's high school jersey. That's the only
way he's ever going to look like a great three-point shooter.</TE>

<HD>No Shock Here--Sparks Win</HD>
<DH>Women's basketball: L.A. works out defensive kinks in a
deceptively easy 90-80 victory over winless Detroit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sparks may be defending league champions with victories in six of
their first seven games, but they still have some holes to fill.</LD>
<LD>   Even in the WNBA's short, 32-game regular season, deficiencies
show up. And one of them has been the Sparks' defense, which looked
spectacular two weeks ago in Houston but has not achieved that level
since.</LD>
<LD>   So Tuesday's game against winless Detroit was an opportunity for
Los Angeles to rediscover the benefit of bottling up an overmatched
opponent.</LD>
<TE>   The verdict? The scoreboard showed a 90-80 Spark victory before
7,487 at Staples Center. The game wasn't that close; Los Angeles
(6-1) led by as many as 21 points in the second half before Coach
Michael Cooper cleared his bench.</TE>
<TE>   And did the Sparks reassert themselves defensively? Yes, with a
couple of reservations.</TE>
<TE>   The 0-7 Shock probably would have scored about 15 fewer points if
Cooper had left his starters in. And while the Sparks did show more
defensive aggressiveness for about 30 of the 40 minutes, it
evaporated as the game got out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Cooper might have fumed afterward about Detroit
narrowing the score at the end. But on Tuesday he was upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually you can come out flat against a team like that," Cooper
said. "But I thought we did a good job overall. We were moving the
ball well and took advantage of their defensive rotations, which were
kind of slow at times."</TE>
<TE>   The players also remembered how opponents are looking for any sign
of not being taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't ever want to underestimate a team that hasn't won,"
said Lisa Leslie, who, along with DeLisha Milton, led the Sparks with
18 points. "We learned that lesson two years ago when we played a
Seattle team that was in last place and lost to them. And Detroit has
good players who play hard and are aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought defensively we did a good job. Sometimes when a team
doesn't really know where its offense is coming from, it's harder to
guard. When you play Houston, you know Sheryl Swoopes and Tina
Thompson are gonna take a lot of shots and you know to keep an eye on
them. Tonight we also wanted to stay at home more, not switch so
much, and if we got beat we got beat all the way."</TE>
<TE>   By stretching their league-record home winning streak to 25 games,
the Sparks demonstrated why they are a dangerous offensive team. Five
players scored in double figures.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles shot well--56.7% from the field, 76.9% from
three-point range--and outrebounded Detroit, 32-27. The Sparks also
had 27 assists, and most of their 21 turnovers came when trying to
make the extra pass.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which got 18 points from Deanna Nolan and 15 points from
Swin Cash, had moments, but many came after the game was decided.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Sparks had built a 20-8 lead, they worked to sustain the
early defensive momentum established when the Shock missed nine of
its first 11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   They moved between man-to-man and zone defenses, battled around
screens and tried to keep a hand in the face of any Detroit shooter.
The Sparks also avoided silly fouls.</TE>
<TE>   It worked for the first half. The Shock was held to 32.4%
field-goal shooting, had five shots blocked, was outrebounded, 20-13,
and trailed, 46-32, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Although Detroit had little chance of coming back, Coach Greg
Williams saw some encouraging signs.</TE>
<TE>   "We played better tonight than in our other losses," Williams
said. "If we keep playing hard, our wins will come."</TE>

<HD>He Knows What It's Like to Be in Poles' Position</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INCHON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>After the United States had lost its first two games at the France
'98 World Cup, it went into its final match against Yugoslavia
determined to prove something.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that the U.S. lost, 1-0, is beside the point. It was the
team's attitude that mattered, goalkeeper Brad Friedel said Tuesday,
because Poland could easily bring that same attitude to Friday's
crucial game against the U.S. in Daejeon, South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The Poles have not only been beaten but have been shut out in
their first two matches at this World Cup, and a loss to the
Americans is unthinkable in Polish eyes. The U.S. needs at least a
tie to make sure of advancing.</LD>
<TE>   "I think, first and foremost, you want to go out and try to save
some face," Friedel said of teams that find themselves in that
position.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our performance against Yugoslavia was probably our best
performance of the [France '98] tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult situation when you know you're going home the
day after, but I think when you're professional, and when you're
competitive, you do want to prove yourself each and every day, and
that's what the Poles will be doing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. advances to the second round, it would play either
Croatia, Italy or Mexico, depending on the outcomes of games in Group
G.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing first in Group D would give the Americans an extra day's
rest since their second-round game would not be until Tuesday. But if
they finish second, they would have to play Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bruce Arena was in no mood to worry about that distinction.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want to do is be in the next round," he said. "I don't
really care whether we finish first or second."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team's injury jinx continued when it was revealed that
defender Steve Cherundolo, a last-minute roster choice after Chris
Armas and Greg Vanney had been sidelined because of injuries, will
miss the remainder of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Cherundolo, who has not played in the tournament, injured his
right knee in training, suffering a severe bone bruise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arena, asked whether he had talked to defender Jeff Agoos, said he
had. Agoos' World Cup has been highlighted by an own goal in the
Portugal match, a yellow card and a foul that led to a penalty kick
for South Korea, and a missed header that resulted in South Korea's
tying goal</TE>
<TE>   "Well, first of all he knows me," Arena said. "I've knocked him
down and picked him up over the last 24 hours. We've talked about it.
He's a big boy."</TE>

<HD>Wells Is All Business in Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>David Wells was probably destined to pitch this game, for one team or
the other.</LD>
<LD>   Working in front of the owner he snubbed last December, Wells got
heavy home-run support and helped the New York Yankees defeat
Arizona, 6-4, Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   A crowd of 44,374 that included Arizona owner Jerry Colangelo
watched Wells (7-3) pitch into the eighth inning.</LD>
<TE>   During the off-season when he was a free agent, Wells visited
Colangelo in Phoenix. By the time Wells left, they had a handshake
agreement on a deal with the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, they had to be thinking, 'We came that close to him,' "
Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "Obviously, they thought they had
him."</TE>
<TE>   But before a contract could be finalized, Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner met with Wells and lured the popular pitcher back into
pinstripes.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez's three-run homer into the upper deck in right field
chased Wells in the eighth. He got a standing ovation from most of
the crowd--Colangelo remained seated in his box next to the Arizona
dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know where he was sitting," Wells said. "I was not
worried about that. I've got to worry about what's in front of me.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate everything he did for me at that time. I do feel
bad. It's tough. He went out of his way to make it right."</TE>
<TE>   Said Diamondback General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr.: "It's in the
past. He's where he wanted to be. End of story."</TE>
<TE>   Colangelo briefly visited Manager Bob Brenly after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Johnson hit a three-run homer, and Jason Giambi and Robin
Ventura had solo shots as the Yankees won their third consecutive
interleague game. They are a season-high 19 games over .500.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez homered, doubled and drove in four runs, but the
Diamondbacks remained winless at Yankee Stadium. They lost all three
games in the Bronx during the World Series, and are 0-2 in this
three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   It was 87 degrees with high humidity at gametime, but that did not
trouble Wells. He retired 15 of the first 16 batters, players who
might otherwise have been his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I pushed that all aside," he said. "I can't let that bother me.
It's just another ballclub."</TE>
<TE>   Ramiro Mendoza relieved and finished for his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Brian Anderson (1-6) fell to 0-8 in his last 18
starts, including a 2-1 loss to Roger Clemens in Game 3 of the World
Series at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what? Warming up tonight, I felt great. I felt as locked
in as I have been in any start this year," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi hit his 17th homer in the first inning. Ventura hit a
run-scoring double in the fourth and Johnson connected with two out
later in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's 15th homer finished Anderson in the sixth. Giambi,
Johnson and Ventura were the only left-handed hitters in the lineup
against Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez hit an RBI double in the sixth, giving him an RBI in
eight consecutive games. That hit came right after third-base coach
Eddie Rodriguez made a poor decision that resulted in Tony Womack
being thrown out at the plate by left fielder Shane Spencer.</TE>

<HD>Sweep Would Put Lakers in a Class by Themselves</HD>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>You would think there would be nothing unprecedented in the winning
department for a franchise and a coach so rich in championships.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have won the NBA title 13 times in two cities. Phil
Jackson is halfway toward opening his own jewelry shop, having
coached his way to eight rings.</LD>
<LD>   But they've never swept a team in the NBA Finals.</LD>
<TE>   Up three games to none against the New Jersey Nets, the Lakers and
Jackson have their chance tonight. And they could also earn a
distinction among the other four champions that have won three
consecutive times: They could become the first team to win three
championships in only 15 Finals games.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, their total of three Finals defeats would be the
fewest of any for a team in a three-year run.</TE>
<TE>   A three-peat with only three-beat.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make history," Shaquille O'Neal said. "It'd be history
for Phil, history for a lot of us."</TE>
<TE>   And it could turn about some personal history for O'Neal and Brian
Shaw, who were on the Orlando Magic team that lost in four games to
Houston in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Even waking up this morning and looking at ESPN, it was 'Oh, the
last team that was swept in the Finals was the Orlando Magic by the
Houston Rockets,' " Shaw said. "That's something that's always out
there that you have to live with. Unfortunately, for myself and for
Shaq, we feel bad, we know what it feels like from the '95 Finals.
Now we have an opportunity to make somebody else feel like that."</TE>
<TE>   It's one more way this group could distinguish itself, record its
deeds in stone rather than pencil.</TE>
<TE>   The team that won a record 12 consecutive road games over the last
two playoffs could establish a new mark of eight consecutive Finals
victories. They have already topped the previous record of six, set
by the Rockets in 1994 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to that last sweep, as seen by the other
side. Robert Horry played for the Rockets then, and he said a sweep
adds something to the championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of lets the league know that you came to play, and what
you did was no fluke," Horry said. "It's a special sense when you go
out and are able to sweep a team."</TE>
<TE>   How special are the Lakers? That really has been the only thing
subject to debate in these NBA Finals. Whether the Nets could win the
series was never seriously discussed, and few are even bothering to
ask if the Nets can win a game. More and more of the questions put to
the Lakers the last two days have turned to the topic of their
legacy.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways a sweep could harm the Lakers as much as it would
help them. It would be further evidence of the weakness of the field
out there. It's the Roy Jones Syndrome: no great boxers in the weight
class to validate the greatness.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers won in six games in 2000, they beat an Indiana
Pacer team that lacked a superstar. The Pacers had a star in Reggie
Miller, a player who has made as many big playoff shots as anyone in
recent memory. But he isn't a transcendent player. The fact that it
took him 13 years to reach the Finals--despite a solid supporting
cast that stayed together longer than most groups in the
NBA--reflects that.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Lakers beat the league's most valuable player, Allen
Iverson, and the Philadelphia 76ers in five games. But the 76ers
didn't have any other threats, and what players they did have were
all hurting. (Remember, though, they had heart).</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have Jason Kidd, considered the best point guard in the
league right now, runner-up to San Antonio's Tim Duncan in the MVP
voting.</TE>
<TE>   After that they have a trio of hopelessly overmatched centers
getting tossed around by Shaq. They have a No. 2 overall pick that
has trouble earning playing time in the fourth quarter. They have a
coach who is 144 playoff victories behind Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   And now they're on the verge of being swept.</TE>
<TE>   A Finals sweep is almost as rare as a three-peat; there have been
only six sweeps. The Lakers have been on the losing end of three of
them: to Boston in 1959, to the Philadelphia 76ers in 1983 and the
Detroit Pistons in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries played a role. James Worthy was out and Norm Nixon and
Bob McAdoo were hurt in 1983, and Magic Johnson and Byron Scott tore
hamstrings in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no mention of that on the first page of the NBA
postseason record book, where the NBA Finals results are listed.
That's the thing about cold facts. They diminish the need for
speculation or interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   One of seven teams to sweep, one of four teams to three-peat, the
only team to do it with only three Finals losses. Win tonight and the
Lakers can say all of the above.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will put us up there," O'Neal said. "We've been
together a long time. We've been through a lot of hard times, more
good times than hard times. But I think it will put us right up there
with all the other great teams."</TE>
<TE>   And, in some ways, above them.</TE>

<HD>Appier Gets Early Shower</HD>
<DH>Angels: He is chased in fifth inning and loses his fourth
consecutive start, 7-3, to the Pirates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This could have been a glorious evening for the Angels. Seattle lost,
so the Angels could have tied the Mariners atop the American League
West with a victory. But the Angels lost too, and they left Edison
Field concerned about whether one of their starting pitchers can
withstand the rigors of the pennant race.</LD>
<LD>   There's nothing seriously wrong with Kevin Appier, or so the
Angels insist. But Appier lost his fourth consecutive start Tuesday,
failing to survive the fifth inning of a 7-3 loss to the Pittsburgh
Pirates.</LD>
<LD>   The Pirates' second baseman, Pokey Reese, doubled twice, singled
and drove in four runs. The Angels' second baseman, Adam Kennedy,
doubled, tripled and wondered anew whether he is no better than a
platoon player in the eyes of his manager.</LD>
<TE>   Appier complained of a tired arm after his previous start.
Athletic trainer Ned Bergert and medical director Lewis Yocum cleared
him to pitch, suggesting a modification in his delivery that would
enable him to throw a breaking ball with less of the forearm
stiffness he had experienced. That worked, Appier said, and he
pitched without discomfort, but during Tuesday's game he discovered
another flaw in his delivery, this one with his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   After pitching into the sixth inning in seven consecutive starts,
Appier has failed to do so in his last two. He pitched 2 2/3 innings
Thursday and 4 2/3 innings Tuesday. He faced 24 batters, half of whom
reached base, on 10 hits, one walk and one hit batter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not a major mechanical thing," he said. "It's a
fine-tuning thing. But I've gone through about three different
fine-tunings."</TE>
<TE>   He will have time for more. Appier will have six days of rest, and
the possibility of extra sessions with pitching coach Bud Black,
before his next start. The Angels are not delaying Appier's next
start; they have days off Thursday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy had extended his hitting streak to six games and lifted
his batting average to .293 when Manager Mike Scioscia removed him
for pinch-hitter Benji Gil in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised, but what are you going to do?" Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates had replaced starter Josh Fogg with left-hander Scott
Sauerbeck, who holds left-handed batters to a .128 average.</TE>
<TE>   "Sauerbeck is tough on lefties," Scioscia said. "That doesn't
preclude Adam from hitting against lefties."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said 12 days ago that Kennedy would have a chance to play
every day so long as he kept hitting. In 36 at-bats against
left-handers, he is hitting .222. He has not started the last two
games against left-handers and, with Gil activated from the disabled
list, Kennedy fears that Scioscia is returning to the platoon he used
in the second half of last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We pretty much know what he's going to do," Kennedy said. "It's
been that way for a while. It doesn't seem to be any different right
now. I'll just keep plugging away."</TE>
<TE>   With the Rally Monkey jumping furiously on the video board, and
with the fans cheering even without the message board telling them to
do so, the Angels came roaring back from a 4-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth inning, Kennedy tripled and scored. In the seventh,
Brad Fullmer and Scott Spiezio hit successive home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Appier was in trouble in every inning. In the first inning, right
fielder Tim Salmon helped Appier with a nice sliding catch of a line
drive. In the second inning, the Pirates scored twice, on a two-run
homer by Kevin Young, after Aramis Ramirez was hit by an Appier
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, after the Pirates got consecutive singles, the
Angels turned a double play behind Appier. In the fourth, the Pirates
took a 3-0 lead, on consecutive doubles. In the fifth, Appier gave up
another run, and three more hits, before Scioscia had seen enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in kind of a funk lately, in conjunction with having
some bad luck," Appier said. "That's a bad combo."</TE>

<HD>Another Painful Outing for Daal</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Struggling starter says his shoulder is hurting
after Devil Rays score nine in fifth on way to 11-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Turns out Kevin Brown wasn't the only Dodger pitcher to injure his
arm May 26. Brown left the game at Arizona that day because of a sore
elbow in the first inning and was relieved by Omar Daal, who threw 3
1/3 scoreless innings and developed a sore shoulder of his own.</LD>
<LD>   But the Dodgers did not discover Daal had a mild case of
tendinitis until late Tuesday night--after the left-hander was
shredded for nine runs on eight hits in 4 1/3 innings of the Dodgers'
11-2 interleague loss to the lowly Tampa Bay Devil Rays before 11,416
in Tropicana Field.</LD>
<LD>   Jared Sandberg, the No. 9 batter in an offense that ranked last in
the American League in average (.237), last in runs (234) and
second-to-last in home runs (47), smacked a solo home run and a
three-run homer to highlight a nine-run fifth inning, becoming the
39th player in major league history to homer twice in an inning.</LD>
<TE>   The Devil Rays had eight hits in the fifth, five of them off Daal,
the reliever-turned-starter who has been roughed up for 21 earned
runs on 24 hits, including four home runs, in 16 1/3 innings of three
starts in place of the injured Brown.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers did not honor Daal's trade request in late March
because they needed him as rotation insurance in case one of their
starters got hurt. With Brown undergoing surgery to repair a
herniated disk in his lower back Tuesday, they are counting on Daal
to be a capable long-term fill-in for Brown.</TE>
<TE>   But Daal's revelation after Tuesday night's loss cast some doubt
on his short-term future, as well as the rotation's.</TE>
<TE>   "My shoulder is a little tight--I felt a little pinching when I
tried to throw over the top--but it should be OK for my next start,"
said Daal, who went from 4-0 with an earned-run average of 0.88 on
May 26 to 4-3 with a 3.92 ERA Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "My location is not the same, my control is not the same, and I've
been leaving the ball up. I saw 84 mph [on the stadium speed gun] and
said, that's not me. I know I don't throw hard, but I can go to 87
mph when I want to."</TE>
<TE>   Daal, whose shoulder began acting up after the Arizona game,
underwent acupuncture to treat a stiff neck Monday, but when told of
Daal's condition after Tuesday's game, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said,
"That's the first I've heard of it."</TE>
<TE>   Daal got off to a rocky start Tuesday, giving up a 403-foot
leadoff home run in the first inning to Randy Winn, who has 11 hits,
eight for extra bases, in his last 15 at-bats. Paul Lo Duca's two-run
double in the third gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead, and Tampa Bay tied
it on Aubrey Huff's sacrifice fly in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Then disaster struck the Dodgers in the fifth. Sandberg ripped
Daal's first pitch 414 feet to left for a homer, and Winn doubled.
Ben Grieve struck out, and Greg Vaughn walked. Huff hit a grounder up
the middle, the ball nicking off the glove of diving second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek for a run-scoring single, and the rout was on.</TE>
<TE>   Four run-scoring singles sandwiched around a suicide squeeze and
Sandberg's 407-foot, three-run shot to left-center against reliever
Giovanni Carrara completed the second-largest inning in Devil Ray
history.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy believed the inning turned on the grounder to Grudzielanek
that was close to being a double play.</TE>
<TE>   "You often hear the phrase that baseball is a game of inches,"
Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   But this was more a game of feet--1,224, to be exact, the combined
number of feet the Devil Ray homers traveled. Or, if you're counting,
14,688 inches.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Phil's Close ... With No Cigar</HD>
<DH>Jackson hasn't built any dynasties, as Auerbach did with
the Celtics, but he's just about to equal Red's nine coaching titles</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Now it's the NBA according to Phil.</LD>
<LD>   This is Phil Jackson's league and has been since 1991, when he won
his first title, through today, when he can secure his ninth, tying
Red Auerbach, who won nine as Boston Celtic coach before tacking on
seven more as team president.</LD>
<LD>   Not that Auerbach can't still zing Jackson in the papers, but Red
puffed his last cloud of cigar smoke on the bench in 1966, which is
practically NBA pre-history, well before it emerged from what Wilt
Chamberlain famously, and others routinely, called "a bush league,"
into the age of $100-million contracts and billion-dollar network
deals.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson and Auerbach are as different as their eras. Auerbach was
out there for all to see, exuberant, gloating, firing up his cigars
after wins, which would start a riot now.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is an enigma hiding in plain sight, a man of startling
contradictions, starting with his love-hate relationship with the
fame that comes with his job.</TE>
<TE>   Auerbach was loathed outside Boston but considered a genius. In
the '70s, the network TV package included a weekly feature called
"Red on Roundball," with Auerbach explaining basics, like the
pick-and-roll, as if he'd invented them.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson isn't universally beloved, although he's really only
loathed in Sacramento, which he once called "a cowtown." But, almost
nine titles later, people still ask if he's the greatest coach since
Auerbach and John Wooden or the luckiest.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, Jackson can be, or come off as, condescending. And he
embodies a double standard or two. However, if he hadn't already
proven it, his Laker tenure has made one thing clear:</TE>
<TE>   He's really good at this.</TE>
<TE>   This is no longer Auerbach's eight-team league. There are 29 teams
and none, since Red in the '60s, had won three consecutive titles
before Jackson's Chicago Bulls did it twice in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Players are now more powerful than coaches, whose authority is no
longer automatic. If a coach retains any power at all, he'll have to
earn it, even Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson arrived in Los Angeles three seasons ago, the Lakers
were like squabbling children, having been eliminated from the
playoffs the three previous seasons, 4-1, 4-0 and 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal thought he was running the franchise and, in
fact, had as much to do with hiring Jackson as anyone except owner
Jerry Buss. Kobe Bryant was on his own planet and he and O'Neal had
just begun to butt their hard heads.</TE>
<TE>   Three seasons later, the Lakers are closing in on their third
title. O'Neal, who has had several run-ins with his hand-picked
mentor, the worst last month during the San Antonio series, is
considered the dominant big man of all time.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who discovered he has teammates and got over his own
problems with Jackson last spring, is considered the heir apparent to
Michael Jordan. Kobe and Shaq are now friends.</TE>
<TE>   All that didn't just happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Even I was wondering," Mitch Richmond said of Jackson, who has
kept him on the bench all season.</TE>
<TE>   "Just watching the NBA Finals whenever Chicago played or the
Lakers played, they always showed that little glimpse of Phil, just
sitting back, looking into the sky ...</TE>
<TE>   "Down six or seven [points], he's over there, about to fall
asleep. You're like, damn, I mean, what is he doing? He's not even
upset! It's like, what in the heck is he thinking about?</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in places where we're watching the game and we're like,
geez, why is he so calm? You know, his team is in trouble, they just
went on a 10-0 run and he doesn't call a timeout!"</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, timeouts are overrated, although the rest of the world
is catching on slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Easy Rider, Revisited</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson may be a pretty good coach, I don't know. It's hard
for me to tell. The guy never gets up. I'm surprised he gets up at
timeouts. He just sits there with his legs crossed. I've listened to
Phil. He's got a lot of answers. But I'm not sure if Tim Floyd
[Jackson's successor in Chicago] wouldn't have been a good coach if
he'd have had Michael Jordan.... .</TE>
<TE>   He used to go off in the woods and eat berries and stuff like
that. And then he just happens to get a job with Kobe Bryant and
Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   --Bob Huggins, University of Cincinnati coach</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Auerbach was a living legend, although his coaching was
the least of it. The Celtics ran a few basic plays and everyone in
the league knew them.</TE>
<TE>   Red was a leader who yelled at his players but cared for them too.
Obnoxious as he could be with outsiders, he was a warm paterfamilias
among his own. The Celtic family was real and exists today, with all
the greats such as Bob Cousy, Tom Heinsohn, Satch Sanders and even
the prickly Bill Russell still involved.</TE>
<TE>   Auerbach's real gift was seeing the big picture, which made him a
minority of one in those hand-to-mouth days.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't have first crack at any of the players he built his
dynasty on--Russell, Cousy, John Havlicek, Dave Cowens, Larry Bird,
Kevin McHale, Robert Parish--but he outsmarted his competitors to
land them, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   He got Rochester to pass on Russell in the '56 draft for a small
fee. (The Royals took Sihugo Green, instead.) He got St. Louis to
trade Russell's rights (for Easy Ed MacAuley and Cliff Hagan.)
Auerbach, alone, figured out that this unusual player--Russell was a
great defender but a klutz on offense--could get his team over the
top.</TE>
<TE>   When the main dynasty that won 11 times from 1957-69--nine under
Auerbach, two under Russell--expired, Auerbach rebuilt fast enough to
win in 1974 and 1976. Then, when that nucleus went, he did it again
and won three more in the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, he drafted Bird as a junior-eligible--with the No. 6
pick, after other teams had taken such notables as Rick
Robey--knowing Bird was staying at Indiana State for his senior year.
This provided no help for the 1978-79 season, when the Celtics went
29-53, but set them up for the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, on the other hand, is no builder of franchises. He's pure
coach.</TE>
<TE>   He now squirms if someone brings up his hippie days, which he once
advertised in his first book, "Maverick," but he remains just that.
He's no longer a hippie--not after promoting Cadillac and TD
Waterhouse, he isn't--but he's still a maverick.</TE>
<TE>   He spurns timeouts on purpose, to let his players learn to trust
themselves, rather than looking to him. And he doesn't mind mocking
convention.</TE>
<TE>   His system, based on the triangle offense he learned from Tex
Winter, is self-regulating. He doesn't have to make a lot of
adjustments, because his players are taught to read the defense and
go to built-in counters.</TE>
<TE>   Modern coaches watch videotape into the early hours of the
morning. Jackson dates the boss' daughter, rides his motorcycle,
walks on the beach, goes to rock concerts and plays.</TE>
<TE>   Modern coaches are control freaks and the more successful, the
more controlling. Jackson runs a tight ship, himself--no outsiders on
the charter, the press is a necessary evil or, some days, just evil,
etc.--except during games. He prepares his players beforehand, then
lets them play.</TE>
<TE>   Other aces, such as Miami's Pat Riley or Philadelphia's Larry
Brown, wear themselves and/or their players out. Jackson's sail
through the season. Jackson explains away any negative developments,
suggesting, as always, he has it covered, so what do they have to
worry about?</TE>
<TE>   At his first Laker media day, he announced that his new players
were going to "remedial school," and said he wouldn't know how good
they were before Christmas, at which point he expected to tell team
President Jerry West what he needed.</TE>
<TE>   Had Jackson's predecessor, Del Harris, said anything like it, he
might have been fired on the spot. But this was Jackson, so everyone
just nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, they used to say Del Harris was in trouble if he
didn't win a championship," noted a Western Conference general
manager, incredulously. "Now Phil gets a $30-million contract and no
one cares if they win a championship?"</TE>
<TE>   Precisely.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Lakers won a title that season, anyway, which
surprised even Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was really sort of unexpected, as far as Phil was
concerned, as far as I was concerned," says Winter. " ... I don't
feel like Phil would have taken the job unless he had a chance to
win, at least eventually. But to win as quickly as we did that very
first year was a little unexpected, I think."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Jackson makes coaching look so easy, even other
players and coaches don't know what he's doing, if anything.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are times it becomes crystal clear, as in this spring's
series against the San Antonio Spurs, when a gimpy O'Neal, pacing
himself, took seven rebounds in the Game 2 loss. Heading to San
Antonio for Games 3 and 4, Jackson told the press he needed more than
that, adding he'd told Shaq that in "a heated" conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, O'Neal was upset and stayed upset, even waving Jackson off
in disgust during a Game 3 timeout, but he scored 22 points and took
down 12 rebounds as the Lakers won.</TE>
<TE>   Then they won Game 4 after O'Neal had taken a key offensive
rebound. Shaq noted later he did it because, "I didn't feel like
hearing Phil's mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Up 3-0 in the Finals, of course, who can stay mad?</TE>
<TE>   "If Phil would have been my coach in Orlando ... I probably would
have been working on [championship] No. 5 or 6 by now," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because at that time, I was young and energetic and had
everything. I needed someone like Phil to keep me straight and keep
me in line. I never had that."</TE>
<TE>   Well, he does now.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Lucky</TE>
<TE>   My parents dedicated me to being a minister. And I tell my mother,
who's still alive, "I became a minister. I've got 12 disciples and
they go on these great jaunts."</TE>
<TE>   --Jackson</TE>
<TE>   Wooden called his book, "They Call Me Coach." Jackson could call
his next one, "They Call Me Lots of Things."</TE>
<TE>   He was "Zen Master" in Chicago for his devotion to meditation, and
"Big Chief Triangle," according to then-Knick Coach Jeff Van Gundy,
who apparently tired of hearing about Jackson's love of Native
American lore.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson irritated the press, making it clear he considered
reporters' work an intrusion, seeming to forget the connection
between publicity and his high salary--now $6 million a year--and
that writing books, with tidbits he had withheld, made him not only a
journalist, himself, but a competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Lampooning him before this spring's Finals, the New York Times'
Harvey Araton, pretending he was Jackson, wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "You may have momentarily forgotten that this incredible run of
coaching genius had its genesis in New Jersey, back in the late
1970s, when the Nets were grooving at the Rutgers Athletic Center in
Piscataway. As I mentioned in my latest book, "More Than a Game" ("A
feast for the true fan." --Bill Bradley), I was paid the sum of
$25,000 one season to serve as Kevin Loughery's assistant on a team
that taught me the guiding principle of my Zen coaching life.</TE>
<TE>   "To wit: Always follow your spirit but, whenever possible, try to
first find out if it intends to hook on with a team that already has
at least two superstars."</TE>
<TE>   This is Jackson's quandary. Although he's actually shy and needs
his space--now, as when he worked in Chicago, he retreats to his Deer
Lake, Mont., home over the summer--there's something he likes about
the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   A voracious reader, he takes considerable pride in his own
authorship. The son of Pentecostal ministers, he likes standing
behind the lectern, which is hauled into the hall in front of the
Laker dressing room at Staples before games, answering questions like
a preacher advising his flock.</TE>
<TE>   His mixed feelings result in a peculiar dialogue, in which Jackson
often gives a rat-a-tat answer, which can be informative or colorful,
then breaks off abruptly and without expression. When he has answered
all the questions, or feels he has been at it long enough, he strides
off swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, he parries questions about himself. But private as
he is, he also tells heart-rending stories about himself, even if
they seem to come out of nowhere, presented matter-of-factly in the
middle of a book about basketball.</TE>
<TE>   In "Sacred Hoops," he describes the toll his parents' fervor took
on him as a child:</TE>
<TE>   "We were taught to believe that the apocalyptic version in the
Book of Revelation was about to be fulfilled any minute and if we
weren't prepared, we'd be left out when Christ returned and gathered
up his saints. As a little boy, I was terrified of being excluded
from the 'rapture of the saints,' as it was called, and losing my
parents. One day, my mother wasn't home when I returned from school
and I got so frightened the rapture had started without me that I ran
all over town looking for her. I was shaking when I finally tracked
her down at a local radio station, taping a religious program with my
dad."</TE>
<TE>   In "More than a Game," he writes of driving to Los Angeles to take
over the Lakers just after separating from his wife, June, playing a
tape that his daughters had made, wishing him well, pulling his car
to the side of the road and weeping.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Jackson took the Laker job because he knew that with
O'Neal and Bryant, he could win more titles.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as Jackson noted--gently--when Net Coach Byron Scott
said last week that Memphis could make the Finals with Shaq, Shaq
hadn't actually won any titles before Phil got there.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, for that matter, had Bryant, Jordan and Scottie Pippen.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Jackson seems more sensitive to being perceived as
arrogant. He has only kidded reporters in these playoffs, rather than
complaining to them about them. He went through the hotly contested
series against the Kings without making a single joke about
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, for better and worse, he's going to be Phil Jackson
for as long as he remains a Laker.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of his five-year deal in 2000, he said it seemed like
an eternity, seeming to doubt that he'd last that long. Now he muses
about finishing out the last two seasons, and perhaps even one after
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year seems like a long, hard grind," he said Tuesday. "I'm
just trying go one year at a time and not push it beyond that.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I've mentioned before is that if Shaquille is
thinking of retiring at the point that I would retire, I would
certainly stay another year just to see him play on....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he should be a guy who gives up his career as early
as he's thinking about it. He thinks that two years is going to be
the end of his career. He certainly needs to play longer than that.
He's got too much talent."</TE>
<TE>   Like O'Neal, there will come a day when Jackson is gone and people
will measure every other coach against him.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is sure, we never saw anyone quite like Jackson and we
never will again.</TE>
<TE>   In his first Finals in 1991, his Bulls lost Game 1 to the Lakers,
and home-court advantage, on Sam Perkins' last-second three-pointer.
As Jackson and June walked out, they encountered the Chicago
Tribune's Sam Smith. June, who was animated, was worried. Phil, who
was Phil, marveled at what a great game it had been.</TE>
<TE>   Fear never entered into the equation, for Jackson, and
consequently, his team, which won the next four games. It wasn't only
Jackson, of course, but it wasn't an accident, either.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Lakers did not appear to be particularly anxious on the eve of
Game 4.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the curious were allowed into the Lakers' practice
Tuesday afternoon, a half-court four-on-four game populated one end
of the Continental Airlines Arena court, and Rick Fox was doing the
commentary from a nearby lectern.</LD>
<LD>   As usual, the pick-up game--seven soon-to-be or potential free
agents and Mark Madsen played--was as heated as anything besides a
Game 7.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Shaquille O'Neal played the interview room.</TE>
<TE>   First, Commissioner David Stern's state-of-the-game address got a
few people thinking again about the talent imbalance in the Western
and Eastern conferences, which led to a question for O'Neal about the
lack of quality post players in the East.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the last time the East had a dominant center was when I
played with Orlando," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By then, O'Neal was on a roll.</TE>
<TE>   On his game: "I have a boom-boom-boom game. I always go to the
first boom. If you take that away, I hit you with the other boom. By
that time, I put the big booty on you and you'll be under the basket
and it's a dunk. Not too many people can withstand my boom-boom."</TE>
<TE>   On living with criticism: "I've been getting criticized ever since
I was a newborn. 'He's not going to fit those Pampers, his boom-boom
is too big. You need some bigger Pampers.' "</TE>
<TE>   On his origin: "I was looking at my mother's book, trying to find
baby pictures. I didn't see any baby pictures. Then I saw a
certificate that said I was found on a train."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There were two noteworthy topics in the Stern address.</TE>
<TE>   The league probably will use instant replay on shots near the
quarter-ending buzzers next season. And NBA Finals games will be
played at approximately 8 p.m. on the East Coast, rather than after
9, as the schedule has dictated this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last team to be swept in the NBA Finals was the Orlando Magic,
of O'Neal and Brian Shaw, in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The sweeper: the Houston Rockets, of Robert Horry.</TE>
<TE>   All three stand on the verge of another sweep.</TE>
<TE>   "It would help redeem that situation a little bit," Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal often has said he wept on the team bus after Game 4 of that
series. "It took us two hours to get to the hotel," O'Neal said.
"They were hitting the buses with the brooms and throwing bricks and
rioting. I was just sitting there crying, looking out. They were
laughing at me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson told the Tacoma News Tribune he may relinquish his
ownership stake in the Lakers to help build another team, possibly
the Seattle SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, interviewed in New York, and Howard Schultz, Seattle's
principal owner, told the newspaper they had had some "what-if"
conversations but no substantive discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "If I ever left the Lakers, it would have to be with somebody like
Howard ... he wants to win so bad," Johnson said. "I'm on top now
[with the Lakers], and we are going to be on the top, but I would
love to help Seattle come up and get to the top."</TE>

<DH>One victory from another title, Lakers focus not on
history, but on finishing the job</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Two days passed neither quickly nor slowly for the Lakers here; they
are accustomed to the methodical and habit-forming pace of the NBA
postseason.</LD>
<LD>   The time simply went, 22 hours a day in Manhattan, two in New
Jersey, about the palatable ratio, even for Shaquille O'Neal, and
he's from New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   Ahead, three games to none, the Lakers can finish the NBA Finals
and become the fifth team in league history to win at least three
titles consecutively with a victory against the New Jersey Nets
tonight at Continental Airlines Arena.</LD>
<TE>   By Tuesday afternoon, they seemed to care less about the
aesthetics of a four-game sweep than its utility. That is, O'Neal's
arthritic toe isn't getting any healthier, the Nets aren't exactly
bubbling with confidence, and there was no sense in hanging around,
or allowing the Nets to do the same. After all, L.A. waits, and the
Lakers can feel it a continent away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a record-book thing," Coach Phil Jackson said. "You just
want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible, because each
game means a lot. There's a lot at risk."</TE>
<TE>   So they bided their time, attended movies, saw the city, broke
down the Nets' full-court press, and waited for what most of the
world figures to be inevitable, another win, perhaps as early as
tonight. Even the Nets haven't sounded as if they have their hearts
in it anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't think about being down, 3-0," guard Jason Kidd said. "I
mean, you start doing that, eventually it's going to end."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the Laker minds wander.</TE>
<TE>   "I've thought about winning this one," Kobe Bryant said. "Then you
kind of dream about winning a fourth one. I mean, everything starts
with a dream, you know? You have to be able to dream. You have to be
able to set goals for yourself in order to achieve them. That's the
first step. So, yeah, I dream about it sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers practiced on a gym floor in the Meadowlands in the
morning, answered handfuls of questions in the early afternoon, and
trucked back to Manhattan after that. In the moments before heading
for the Lincoln Tunnel, however, Rick Fox was struck by a question
about legacies.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and Bryant, of course, seem destined to have their jerseys
on an arena wall someday, and their busts in a Springfield, Mass.,
hall. Theirs will be legacies of championships now, of course, but
also about fantastic individual statistics, and nights they were as
good as anyone who ever played basketball, and game rooms filled with
All-Star shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Fox and those Lakers like him-- Robert Horry, Brian Shaw, Derek
Fisher, Devean George, those who have filled gaps around O'Neal and
Bryant for three seasons--perhaps will cling more to the championship
banners tacked beside the famous jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   A win tonight, or soon, would put the Lakers in the same place as
the Minneapolis Lakers (1952-54) and the two Chicago Bull teams of
the 1990s among teams to win three straight titles, if behind the
legendary Boston Celtic teams that won eight in a row from 1959-66.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of our way to get into the Hall of Fame," Fox said,
smiling. "They'll show pictures of the team that won it each year and
I'll be able to go there and show my kids my picture alongside Shaq
and Kobe in the team picture, along with Phil and the rest of the
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Not lesser players, he said. Just not as great.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played the game as a supporting cast with the understanding
that a lot of other people in this league greater than ourselves
individually have not shared in the experiences we have the last
three years because of Phil, Phil's leadership, and Shaq and Kobe's
excellent play," Fox said. "I think we're humble enough to know that
there's a lot of other people capable of doing our job. Yet, still,
we happened to be in the right place at the right time."</TE>

his first three NBA seasons. The others: Chicago's Scott Williams,
Minneapolis' Whitey Skoog and four Celtics--K.C. Jones, Tom Sanders,
Larry Siegfried and Gene Guarilia.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw is a captain figure in a locker room replete with leader
types. Fisher is sturdy and responsible. Horry has a star's coolness
in a reserve's ego.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past eras, on those championship teams, some of the role
players were the favorite guys," Fisher said. "Kurt Rambis. Michael
Cooper. Norm Nixon. Other guys, like Bobby Jones. Andrew Toney.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully it will be the same for us. As we continue to be part
of something special, people will remember the contributions that we

<HD>Devil Will Be in the Details for Game 4</HD>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Nets said Tuesday they would like to prolong the inevitable at
least until Game 5 on Friday. However, they were more than a little
hazy about the details when asked how to defeat the Lakers tonight in
Game 4.</LD>
<LD>   A loss tonight would end the Nets' first NBA Finals experience
after only four games and no doubt prompt comparisons to the most
one-sided championship series in league history. There hasn't been a
Finals sweep since 1995, when the Houston Rockets dispatched the
Orlando Magic.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know," guard Kerry Kittles said when asked how the Nets
could better contain Shaquille O'Neal, who is averaging 37 points,
and Kobe Bryant, averaging 27.3.</LD>
<TE>   "We did a lot of good things in Game 3. Shaq was himself. Kobe was
himself. They are two dominating players."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant led the Lakers with 36 points and O'Neal had 35 in the
Lakers' 106-103 victory Sunday in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Kittles said when asked whether the Nets' lack of
playoff experience has doomed them to defeat against the two-time
defending champion Lakers. "They're a good team. They're an
underrated defensive team. They take you out of most of the things
you want to do. Their experience helps them. It's something you have
to deal with. That team has a ton of experience."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Keith Van Horn dismissed any talk of the Nets'
inexperience contributing to their loss Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt we missed a steal on Kobe," Van Horn said, referring to
Bryant's jump shot with 19 seconds to play after splitting a
double-team of Kittles and Jason Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed a couple of late shots. I don't know if that's
inexperience or just the way the ball bounces."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have lost the first three games of the Finals, but at
least they haven't lost their sense of humor. Coach Byron Scott had
this to say about the inexperience of his big men, who have been
overwhelmed by O'Neal:</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a Vlade Divac [Sacramento's wily center]. We don't
have a 7-foot-1 guy who's agile, who can score from the outside and
inside, who's been in Hollywood for a long time so he understands the
acting roles and all that stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "Todd [MacCulloch] and Aaron [Williams] and Twin [Jason Collins],
they're not hip to that stuff yet. They don't understand how to flop.
I'm going to send them to Vlade School this summer for acting lessons
and see if we can get them a little better at it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott also hasn't given up his hope for an unprecedented comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we win a game and then we win the next game, then it's
a series again," he said. "Then you never know what happens. That's
what we want to do. We want to prolong this thing because you never
know what's going to happen. Guys get hurt. Guys get bumps and
bruises. Guys are all of a sudden not playing as well. They start
losing their confidence. The longer we prolong the series, the better
chance we have of winning it."</TE>

<LD>Former champion Lindsay Davenport withdrew from Wimbledon on Tuesday
because she has not fully recovered from knee surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Davenport, who won in 1999, had surgery on her right knee in
January and has missed the Australian Open and French Open, causing
her to drop from No. 1 to No. 6 in the WTA world rankings.</LD>
<LD>   "I am extremely disappointed not to be able to play on the grass
at Wimbledon this year," the 26-year-old American said. "I really
hoped I could make it back from my surgery earlier than expected and
be able to play at Eastbourne and Wimbledon but it is just not
possible yet."</LD>
<TE>   Davenport said she was optimistic she would be ready for the
hardcourt season, starting in July. Tony Godsick, her agent, said
Davenport is scheduled to play at the Bank of the West event in
Stanford on July 22.</TE>

<KH>STANLEY CUP FINALS NOTEBOOK</KH>
<HD>Bowman Feels Fortunate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Detroit's Scotty Bowman already has eight Stanley Cup championships
and his Red Wings are one victory away from his ninth, which would
move him ahead of his mentor Toe Blake for the record of most Stanley
Cups won by a coach.</LD>
<LD>   "I will enjoy it when I finish coaching," said Bowman, whose Red
Wings will play host to Carolina in Game 5 of the best-of-seven
series Thursday at Joe Louis Arena. "Most of [the Stanley Cups] are
caused by being in the league a long time.</LD>
<LD>   "I was fortunate. I was 32 or 33 when I started, and got on some
[good] teams the first three years. We weren't as good as some teams
in the league and we got in the finals and didn't win any games.
Obviously, that didn't help that record. Then Montreal, when the team
was on the ascension it was a team that had all kinds of draft
choices."</LD>
<TE>   With the Canadiens, Bowman, 68, won five Stanley Cups with a team
that was much different than his current Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Canadiens] drafted all their players, but they had a hoard
on the market of draft picks," Bowman said. "This team has gone out
and spent quite a bit of money. I have been fortunate to be with a
team that spent money to get players. I don't think at my stage of my
career I could go with a team that's building to the future."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman, who has said that he will not coach after the 2002-03
season, compares his current Red Wings to the St. Louis Blues, a team
he led to three consecutive Stanley Cup finals early in his coaching
career.</TE>
<TE>   "St. Louis also had a very experienced team of players that maybe
in a lot of cases their prime was behind them," he said. "But I mean,
I started with Glen Hull, Doug Harvey, Dickie Moore [and] they rank
in the NHL with the greatest players of all time and in a different
era."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest postseason disappointments for Carolina has
been the play of forward Sami Kapanen, who has only one goal in 22
playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, Kapanen was a force playing on a line
with center Ron Francis. But in the playoffs, especially against the
Red Wings, Kapanen has been a no-show.</TE>
<TE>   "Ronnie's going to see the top two sets of [defensemen] all night
long," Carolina Coach Paul Maurice said. "Sami has obviously
struggled getting shots off at the net. It's been difficult for him,
and it [has] showed."</TE>
<TE>   In the Red Wings' 3-0 Game 4 victory on Monday, Kapanen had only
two shots on goal and Maurice moved him off the Hurricanes' top line,
skating him with Erik Cole and Rod Brind'Amour.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like I don't get a whole lot of offense right now,"
he said. "I've got to focus on other things. At this point of [the]
year, you want to get going offensively and bring something to the
table."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit defenseman Jiri Fischer became the first player suspended
for a Stanley Cup finals game after the NHL reviewed his cross-check
on Carolina's Tommy Westlund in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer received a one-game suspension for slamming his stick to
Westlund's face--the Hurricane forward fell to the ice bleeding.
Westlund needed five stitches inside his mouth, but no penalty was
called on the play because referees Paul Devorski and Don Koharski
did not see the hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Fischer's suspension was based on the fact that he delivered
an intentional cross-check to the face of the Carolina player,"said
NHL executive vice president Colin Campbell, who handles disciplinary
issues for the league.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia goaltender Ron Hextall was suspended during the
Stanley Cup finals in 1987, but he served the suspension at the start
of the 1987-88 regular season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ABC's telecast of Game 3 Saturday night drew a 3.3 national
rating--low by prime-time TV standards but a 3% increase from last
year's Game 3 between Colorado and New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wing-Hurricane Game 3 was played on Saturday night,
traditionally the lowest-rated TV night of the week.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche-Devils Game 3 was on a Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The 5,482,462 total viewers for this year's Game 3 made it the
most-watched Stanley Cup Game 3 since at least 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night's Game 4 had a 3.5 national rating, a 52% increase
from last year's 2.3 rating for Game 4, which was played on a
Saturday night.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson fight was a knockout in more ways than
one. The pay-per-view telecast of Lewis' eight-round knockout victory
Saturday night drew 1.8 million buys--the second highest ever--and
generated a record $103 million, according to figures released
Tuesday by HBO and Showtime.</LD>
<LD>   HBO and Showtime, which combined to televise the fight, had
projected approximately 1 million pay-per-view buys.</LD>
<LD>   The record number of buys for a fight is 1.99 million for the 1997
Evander Holyfield-Tyson bout in which Tyson was disqualified for
biting Holyfield's ear.</LD>
<TE>   That fight, which cost $49.95 as opposed to $54.95 for Saturday's
fight, generated $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   The buys for Tyson-Lewis consisted of 1.2 million from cable
systems and 600,000 from satellite homes throughout the 50 states.</TE>
<TE>   Not since the 1999 fight between Oscar De La Hoya and Felix
Trinidad has a pay-per-view fight generated more than 1 million buys.</TE>
<TE>   The Lewis-Tyson fight will be replayed on HBO Saturday night at
9:45. Announcing will be HBO's team of Fran Charles, George Foreman
and Larry Merchant.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>And so tonight the suspense begins, tick by tick, dribble by dribble,
a town and its team counting down to the most anticipated sight in
the Los Angeles sports landscape.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth game of the NBA Finals could produce it. Emotion will
rule it. History can judge it. Millions might never forget it.</LD>
<LD>   The Mark Madsen dance</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, c'mon, you're not serious," said Madsen, crinkling his
splendidly childish face.</TE>
<TE>   What, you thought we were talking about an NBA title?</TE>
<TE>   Championship, shmampionship.</TE>
<TE>   We know the Lakers are going to win the title. If they don't win
it tonight in a four-game sweep against the hopelessly overmatched
New Jersey Nets, they will certainly win it by next week.</TE>
<TE>   What nobody knows is what will happen at the ensuing city
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Will Madsen break out the dance he made famous on a downtown stage
after last year's parade?</TE>
<TE>   Will he attempt a new dance?</TE>
<TE>   Or, as feared last year, will his no-rhythm writhing truly be the
result of some sort of tropical intestinal distress?</TE>
<TE>   Who knows, maybe he will disappoint people in five counties by
simply not moving at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Madsen said, smiling. "I didn't know I was going
to do it last year until I just did it. I have no idea what will
happen this year."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but his teammates know.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust me, he's dancing like last year," said teammate Devean
George. "He will dance. We will make him dance."</TE>
<TE>   And why not?</TE>
<TE>   Did anything capture last year's Laker glow better? Was there a
more compelling example of the city's Laker-infused childlike joy? It
certainly made more sense than a Phil Jackson poem.</TE>
<TE>   Surely you remember. It was at the completion of last year's
championship parade, on a stage in front of Staples Center, when the
players had just finished thanking everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly hip-hop music filled the speakers, whereupon Shaquille
O'Neal grabbed the microphone, ran to the front and began rapping
about the championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody started dancing, so I just jumped in and joined them,"
recalled Madsen. "I didn't think it was any big deal. It was just
dancing."</TE>
<TE>   That would be one description of it.</TE>
<TE>   Another would be, violently contorting.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another would be, behaving as if you were the star of a
B-movie western and someone had just put a bullet in your leg.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what it was like?" George said. "It was like Mad Dog was
wearing headphones and couldn't hear the music. It's like he was
dancing to an entirely different song."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd gasped. His teammates stopped and stared.</TE>
<TE>   At home in Mississippi, future teammate Lindsey Hunter grabbed the
remote control.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'What is that?' " he recalled. "I turned it to a
different channel right away."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Rick Fox offered the following review on behalf of the
entire team.</TE>
<TE>   "My, my goodness," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Madsen, who takes this all with wonderfully good humor, said he
was just being Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how I always danced, at church parties and school dances
and family stuff," he said. "When I was younger and danced, everyone
was smiling, so I thought it was because I was good. Now I realize,
it's, well ... it's just me being me."</TE>
<TE>   It's this charm that has enabled Madsen to become one of the
Lakers' most popular players, even if he rarely plays.</TE>
<TE>   He has appeared in only one of three games in these Finals, for
only two minutes. But when he reported to the scorer's table that
night, the Staples Center crowd roared.</TE>
<TE>   It is the same cheer that has accompanied his every move in two
seasons, a cheer for a guy unafraid to be his rah-rah self on a team
of sophisticated stars, whether that means waving a towel at the end
of the bench or baking a cake for a team trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "Make sure everybody knows I also barbecue," he said with a laugh.
"I barbecue more than I bake cakes."</TE>
<TE>   Because he was just being himself, Madsen had no idea that this
vision of a 6-foot-9 pale guy stomping around amid the world's
coolest athletes last summer would become so popular until later,
when the phone started ringing and neighbors started talking.</TE>
<TE>   "So I watched it on television for the first time," he said. "And
I realized, oh, so that's what everyone is talking about."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to Madsen, people have talked about little else.</TE>
<TE>   From the man known as Mad Dog, they have clamored for the dance
best titled "Wounded Dog."</TE>
<TE>   When he's been on the road, fans have shouted for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them, I just can't do it on demand, I have to be feeling
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When he has been working in the weight room, teammates have turned
up the music and begged for it.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what it's like?" Hunter said. "It's like Frankenstein at
the ballet."</TE>
<TE>   When Madsen visited the White House during the off-season with the
other Lakers, this guy named Bush even talked about the dance.</TE>
<TE>   "The President turned to me and said, 'Now, I'm not going to ask
you to dance,' " recalled Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he took this as a cue to boogie, and stepped forward to
begin his performance when he noticed the Secret Service folks
stepping toward him.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of them suddenly got this jerking motion," he said. "So
I stopped."</TE>
<TE>   There you have it. Mark Madsen's dancing is so sorry, it's
considered a national security risk.</TE>
<TE>   And so splendid, I can hardly wait.</TE>

<LD>They like their privacy, these clean-shaven, quiet-spoken,
fan-friendly Angels.</LD>
<LD>   They don't mind that their 31-11 record over the last 42 games is
the best-kept secret in sports. They say it's really OK, fine and
dandy, that the nation does not turn its collective lonely eye this
way, toward a baseball team that has spent its history feeling cursed
and is used to being unappreciated.</LD>
<LD>   "From our standpoint," Tim Salmon said, "I don't think we mind if
no one notices us. We can just keep going out and playing baseball."</LD>
<TE>   "We don't need the publicity," Garret Anderson said. "We just need
to play baseball like we're playing. Every day. We haven't proven
anything, so why should people take notice?"</TE>
<TE>   This is nice, a team being genuinely surprised to hear that
someone, anyone, thinks they have accomplished anything of note. The
Angels don't mind that their Rally Monkey is more famous than any of
them. They are not insulted the fans haven't celebrated their amazing
May and pretty nice-so-far June by packing Edison Field, by swamping
the ticket office, by eagerly concocting trades that would make the
Angels better. They totally understand how a 6-14 start forges an
image of losing that is not quickly erased. Not with their history of
spectacular failures.</TE>
<TE>   They are not in awe of themselves, nor are they particularly
surprised to find themselves a game behind the Seattle Mariners in
the American League West. "I would say," Salmon says, "that this is
not surprising in that we're playing the kind of baseball everybody
on this team is capable of."</TE>
<TE>   But if the Lakers defeat the New Jersey Nets tonight and put a
merciful end to this NBA Finals series, Salmon, Anderson and the rest
of the Angels will be noticed this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   It is slightly possible that our two local baseball teams will
engage in a three-game Dodger Stadium interleague series as
first-place teams.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Dodgers not lost to the woebegone Devil Rays, 11-2,
Tuesday night and had the Angels not lost to the Pirates, 7-3, our
Angels and our Dodgers would have been tied for first, with thanks
going to the Diamondbacks and Mariners for losing.</TE>
<TE>   We'll need to wait at least another day for that to happen.</TE>
<TE>   This has happened in near secrecy, at least on the part of the
Angels. Because they started the season as pathetic patsies--unable
to hit at all, field much and pitching only occasionally--you, Angel
fan, can be forgiven if you tuned them out, if you gave up, if you
put all your efforts into spitting venom about the Sacramento Kings
and heaping praise on the Lakers and making plans for a summer
vacation that didn't include a trip to Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   After all, as the Angels became the May menace, the few serious
Angel fans spent the month confused, trying to find the games
somewhere on TV or radio. Because they share their radio station with
the Lakers and because the Lakers take precedence, it was musical
numbers on your radio dial. And because the Angels share their
television station with the Lakers and the Lakers are the bigger
draw, the Angels didn't get on the air much.</TE>
<TE>   It was almost sad to hear a desperate Angel backer call in,
postgame, to the Angel broadcasters and say, "Where can I find the
game tomorrow?" Some Angel fans actually needed the morning paper to
find the score!</TE>
<TE>   And, you, Dodger fan, might be tempted to put all hopes on hold,
what with Kevin Brown having had his back cut open Tuesday and the
prospects that he'll win another game this season pretty much cut
out.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a charm to what is happening for both the Dodgers and
Angels. There is something worth rooting for, a team whose ace is
flat on his back; another team whose history seems cursed and whose
season was written off by many of us in April.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels can't win every game, even if that's how it has seemed
lately.</TE>
<TE>   Boos were heard when starting pitcher Kevin Appier struggled
Tuesday and gave up four runs in five innings and when Anderson
seemed turned around on a couple of catchable fly balls. This is a
good thing. It means people care. It means there are hopes and dreams
and even some expectations.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard for Angel fans to get their hopes up. It is easier to
believe that after the rise, the inevitable fall will come quickly
and hard.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you are on a team that's going good, you think things
are great," says Salmon, who has been part of many good Angel streaks
and always seen them end ugly. "There's not a short answer to this,
but I think this team is the most well-balanced team I've been on.
Even the 1995 team, we had [Mark] Langston and [Chuck] Finley as
starting pitchers, but after that ... "</TE>
<TE>   Now the Angels are the only team in baseball to have five starting
pitchers with at least five wins each. If there is no Pedro
Martinez-type ace, there is no dead spot either.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most solid team I've been on," Anderson says.
"Everybody knows their role and understands it. Everybody accepts
their role and does it well."</TE>
<TE>   After trailing, 4-0, the Angels got within a run of the Pirates in
the bottom of the seventh when Brad Fullmer and Scott Spiezio went
back-to-back with home runs. The fireworks smoke hadn't cleared when
Pokey Reese cleared the loaded bases with a three-run double in the
top of the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   So first place waits. The Dodgers are up next. Don't look now, but
baseball matters in Southern California. All of it.</TE>

<KH>NBA FINALS NEW JERSEY VS. LAKERS SERIES REPORT/OTHER VIEWS</KH>
<HD>A Taste They'll Never Forget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE VACCARO</AU>
<BD>NEWARK STAR-LEDGER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Twenty-seven years later, Mike Riordan can recall every emotion
colliding under his skin across four awful nights in Oakland and
Washington. All this time later, Riordan knows exactly what the Nets
will feel if their heads disappear underneath the quicksand tonight.</LD>
<LD>   "When you get swept in the Finals, nothing you did before
matters," Riordan said. "It has a residual effect too. No matter how
many strides you think you made during a season, it takes you months
to remember them because the last taste in your mouth is such a
bitter one."</LD>
<LD>   Riordan was a member of the Knicks' 1970 NBA champions, and five
years later he was chasing after a second ring as a member of the
heavily favored Washington Bullets. In 1971, the Bullets had been
swept out of the Finals by the Milwaukee Bucks, and captain Wes
Unseld raged that it would never happen again. In 1975, it happened
again against the Golden State Warriors.</LD>
<TE>   "You'll never know a more miserable experience in basketball,"
Riordan said over the telephone from his restaurant in Annapolis, Md.
"But I do know this: When you get swept out of the Finals, you go one
of two ways. You either make a solemn vow to make things right the
next time you get there. Or you drive yourself crazy trying."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan never did taste the ultimate payoff with the Bullets
because he retired a year before they made their only championship
run in 1978. But he broadcast that team on local TV, and he'd lived
through the two years in between, and he saw up close just how
getting swept motivated those Bullets, and he shared in their
ultimate vindication.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Nets will allow themselves to get swept, to be
honest," Riordan said. "But if they do, I can promise you this: If
they ever do go back to the Finals, they'll remember every bit of
what it will feel like in that locker room [tonight]."</TE>
<TE>   Such is the fuel that still drives Shaquille O'Neal, who has never
forgotten the sense of abject failure that seized the Orlando Magic
in 1995, when the Houston Rockets methodically ushered that team out
of the Finals in four straight.</TE>
<TE>   From the start of these Finals, the only people who truly believed
the Nets had a chance of winning this series were the 12 men on the
team.</TE>
<TE>   What they've discovered is that experience matters as much as
talent in the Finals. Not only the experience the Lakers have accrued
in winning back-to-back titles either. There is a tangible feeling to
O'Neal's old furies. The Nets can feel it every night. It's the
engine pushing them ever closer to becoming the seventh team to feel
a broom at their backs.</TE>
<TE>   "Experience is definitely a key, and it's great that we're getting
so much of it," Keith Van Horn said. "Although I don't think we
necessarily need to be swept to get experience. We've accomplished
too much in these playoffs to feel like we gained nothing out of
them."</TE>

<DH>World Cup: Defending champions eliminated by Denmark, 2-0,
leave tournament without scoring a goal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INCHON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>When it was all over, when the World Cup had slipped from France's
grasp and the world champions were world champions no more, Marcel
Desailly and Djibril Cisse made a symbolic trek to one corner of
Munhak Stadium here.</LD>
<LD>   There, France's past and France's future met France's fans, and
the two players' actions captured the heartbreak of Tuesday's 2-0
loss to Denmark that ended the defending champions' dream of
repeating their feat of four years earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Desailly, the 33-year-old Chelsea defender who was the rock upon
which France's 1998 title rested, raised his hands and applauded the
fans, thanking them for their support in what had been a disastrous
title defense--France going 0-2-1, scoring no goals and becoming the
first world champion eliminated in the first round since Brazil in
1966.</LD>
<TE>   One of the fans, looking directly at Desailly, spread his arms
wide and shrugged his shoulders in Gallic fashion, as if to ask,
"Why, what went wrong?"</TE>
<TE>   Desailly had no answer.</TE>
<TE>   Cisse, the 20-year-old Auxerre forward who represents the next
generation of French stars, made a different gesture.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of applauding, he peeled off his national team jersey and
hurled it up into the bank of blue-clad fans, as if to rid himself of
any ties to this debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Cisse's World Cup will come later, perhaps in 2006, perhaps in
2010.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat, which followed an earlier one to Senegal and a tie
with Uruguay, left all of France stunned, the extent of the blow to
the country's collective psyche so evident that French President
Jacques Chirac felt compelled to address it.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac sent a letter to Desailly, the French captain, saying he
was "deeply disappointed" in the outcome, but proud of what "Les
Bleus" had accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot forget the marvels that you brought to life in our
country in 1998 and 2000 [when France added a European championship
to its world championship]," Chirac wrote. "You must now conquer this
defeat and rejoin the path to the heights of French football which
must remain a model for the world."</TE>
<TE>   It will take the players some time to absorb the shock, however.
On Tuesday, they could only look to the past, not the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never have imagined that we could be eliminated in the
first round," said inspirational playmaker Zinedine Zidane, who
returned from injury to try to raise France from the dead but was
largely ineffective against an organized and determined Danish team.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we must do something," Zidane said. "We must be able to turn
the page. All of us have to ask ourselves questions to try to
understand what happened here."</TE>
<TE>   France came into the game needing to win by two goals to salvage a
place in the second round. It didn't happen. Dennis Rommedahl put
Denmark ahead in the 22nd minute and Jon Dahl Tomasson scored in the
67th.</TE>
<TE>   France's forward line, even with a half-fit Zidane supplying the
passes, simply did not have the ability to solve the defensive puzzle
posed by the Danes, no matter how much the crowd of 48,100 cheered
Zidane's every move.</TE>
<TE>   "When they scored their second goal, we needed much more than a
miracle," French defender Bixente Lizarazu said. "Over the last six
years, we have become used to winning, we always had luck.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we don't really understand what happened here."</TE>
<TE>   France was held scoreless for 270 minutes in the World Cup and
striker David Trezeguet was at a loss to explain why.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not play that badly," he said. "We created many
opportunities to score--even today we hit the crossbar again [on
shots by Desailly and Trezeguet]. But when it doesn't want to go into
the net there is not much you can do. We could have spent two more
hours playing without being able to score a goal."</TE>
<TE>   With Robert Pires lost to injury before the World Cup began, with
Zidane sidelined by injury when the team arrived in South Korea and
with Thierry Henry suspended after getting a red card in the Uruguay
tie, France did not have the players who could take their places.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Roger Lemerre conceded that his team deserved to be ousted.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not deserve to go through," he said. "We must accept
defeat like we accepted victory. It's a very tough day for myself and
for all the fans."</TE>
<TE>   The victory by Denmark left it in first place in Group A, from
which it advances along with Senegal to the round of 16.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a good day," Danish Coach Morten Olsen said. "The team
played with a lot of confidence and, especially, a lot of
discipline."</TE>
<TE>   It will need both qualities in the second round, where it will
play either Argentina, England or Sweden on Saturday in Niigata,
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The French, meanwhile, were making plans to fly back to Paris
today.</TE>
<TE>   The players will not be met by joyous, cheering throngs at the
airport or along the Champs-Elysees.</TE>
<TE>   Those days are over.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the end of a beautiful story," Trezeguet said.</TE>

First-Round Flops
Other notable teams that did not make it out of group play at the
World Cup:
1950: England
The United States' 1-0 upset of England has been well documented. But
it was another 1-0 loss, to Spain, that eliminated the English
1966: Brazil and Italy
The defending champion, Brazil, lost 3-1 decisions to Hungary and
Portugal and left complaining about rough play. Italy didn't make it
out of the first round in five of seven tournaments between 1950-74,
but this one was particularly mortifying, as the Italians were sent
home by North Korea in a 1-0 upset
1994: Colombia
The trendy pick as a darkhorse favorite, Colombia first lost to
Romania, then was stunned by the United States, 2-1
1998: Spain
Spain's reputation for underachieving once against played out when
the top-seeded Spaniards blew a one-goal lead late in a 3-2 loss to
Nigeria and tied Paraguay, 0-0</TE>
