<LD>Errol Roussel stood in the middle of a Hollywood dream: a
construction site in the former Schwab's drugstore on Hollywood
Boulevard, near Ivar Avenue. Sure, it's just a dusty loft now, but,
says its 32-year-old developer, it's destined to be the next cool
spot in Hollywood--a "digital supper club," a
restaurant-bar-screening room. "That's where the VIP screening room
will be," he told visitors who'd been lured Wednesday night by the
promise of a party at Star Shoes bar, the slick mix of drinks and
footwear, next door. A group of four nodded in unison. A cell phone
rang.</LD>
<LD>   Roussel un-spooled the spiel: unique revenue streams, a concept
supper club, product differentiation.</LD>
<LD>   The group seemed more interested in the opening date--which is
nebulous. Sometime in the early summer, maybe.</LD>
<TE>   A young couple came up the stairs. "Thanks for coming, man," he
said, and was introduced to the woman. "Your name is Cinnamon? Like
the flavor?"</TE>
<TE>   He took a break from schmoozing to talk about himself. "I put in
$250,000 of my own money," said Roussel, a onetime waiter who has an
MBA from Pepperdine, Oliver Peoples glasses and a whiff of a goatee.
"I liquidated my 401(k) and put in all my savings," he said. "I did
it the old-fashioned way."</TE>
<TE>   The club is far from finished, and the concept supper club is
still just that--a concept. But Roussel and his partner, Kimberly
Hermann, 29 (who worked the black-clad crowd in front of Star Shoes'
display cases), have procured early buzz by sponsoring events at the
Sundance and AFI film festivals.</TE>
<TE>   A young man climbed the stairs to the loft to greet Roussel.
"Hey," he said, "you remember me from Sundance? The Jodie Foster
party?"</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, at the new Club A.D. on North Highland Avenue,
Columbia Records' budding star Pete Yorn captivated hundreds of young
Hollywood execs and their fame-hungry clients at E! Entertainment
network's Sizzlin' 16 party.</TE>
<TE>   While Yorn's rumored girlfriend Winona Ryder didn't make the show,
the crowd was jumping as he took the stage, thanks to Beastie Boys
deejay Mixmaster Mike's spinning. During his 50-minute set, Yorn, who
recently returned from a European tour, performed songs from his
album "musicforthemorningafter" while fans sang along. The annual
party, which was taped to air Saturday on E!, is held to recognize 16
actors under 30 that the network has deemed "the ones to watch."
Among this year's picks are Kate Hudson's younger brother Oliver
Hudson, "Lord of the Rings" co-star Orlando Bloom, Erika Christensen
of "Traffic," Gabrielle Union of "Bring It On," Clayne Crawford of "A
Walk to Remember" and "White Oleander" star Taryn Manning. "Malcolm
in the Middle's" Frankie Muniz held hands with young Hilary Duff, who
has the title role in the Disney Channel's "Lizzie McGuire."</TE>
<TE>   Taking Attendance</TE>
<TE>   Payroll watchdog Matt Drudge accused "Today's" Katie Couric of
playing hooky from work earlier this week. In a Web site item, Drudge
claims that Couric, who just negotiated a new multimillion-dollar
contract with NBC, called in sick Tuesday but was "partying it up"
with boyfriend and power producer Tom Werner in Boston to celebrate
the new owners of the Red Sox. A spokeswoman for "Today" laughed off
the report, saying the incident "seems to have caused quite a stir."</TE>
<TE>   "If Katie wanted a day off, she could have asked for one," the
spokeswoman said Wednesday. "In this case, she was sick and after
resting for a day and a half, she felt well enough to attend it. She
was back on air this morning."</TE>
<TE>   Godfather of Soul Faces Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   James Brown is in Los Angeles Superior Court this week fighting a
sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Lisa Ross Agbalaya, a former
employee who claims that the Godfather of Soul fired her after she
dismissed his sexual advances. A trial in the case was scheduled to
begin Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has been fighting the lawsuit since it was filed in May
2000. Agbalaya has reportedly demanded $2 million of the soul star.
In a statement issued Wednesday, Brown declared: "I look forward to
my day in court when I will personally appear and respond under oath
to those baseless and outrageous allegations of sexual harassment in
the workplace and to the individuals who have mistakenly concluded
that I would rather settle a case of this kind than to pay high legal
defense costs."</TE>
<TE>   Agbalaya claims Brown fired her and shut down the West Coast
branch of his enterprise because she filed the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's attorney Debra Opri and Agbalaya's lawyer Matthew Herrell
were in trial at press time and could not be reached for comment.</TE>

Center in Los Angeles:</TE>

passenger said.</TE>

<HD>Booksellers Are Wise to the Value of a Little Dust on the
Jacket</HD>
<DH>Dealers know age and public whim often dictate what is
collectible--Tolkien's in; Huxley's out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to the film version of "The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of
the Ring," author J.R.R. Tolkien is hotter now among book collectors
than at any time since his "Rings" trilogy was first published in the
'50s. This leads antiquarian bookseller David Brass to deadpan, "We'd
be very happy if Hollywood would make a 15-part miniseries of John
Galsworthy."</LD>
<LD>   A little book humor there. It seems that Galsworthy, his 1932
Nobel Prize in literature notwithstanding, is off the radar with
collectors, although, Brass said, "We can still sell a fine copy of
'The Forsyte Saga.'"</LD>
<LD>   Poor Galsworthy, who died in 1933, is in good company. Among other
writers who have been relegated to "you collect whose works?" status
are California's William Saroyan ("The Human Comedy"), William
Thackeray and Aldous Huxley. Fame, it seems, does not guarantee
collectibility.</LD>
<TE>   In the '20s, says Mike Hime, co-proprietor with his daughter,
Jennefer, of Biblioctopus in Beverly Hills, "Dickens was the most
collected, but Thackeray was a close second. Today, no one collects
Thackeray, except maybe 'Vanity Fair.'" As for Huxley? Pretty much a
washout among collectors, save for a first edition of "Brave New
World."</TE>
<TE>   Among the "ins," not surprisingly, is J.K. Rowling, with her
phenomenally successful Harry Potter books. If you happen to have one
of the 300 first editions of the first volume as it was originally
published in England, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," and
it's in A-1 shape and with its dust jacket, think $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, says Benjamin Weinstein, co-owner of Heritage Book Shop,
a haven for antiquarian collectors that occupies a richly appointed
former mortuary on Melrose Avenue, "Most books have no value." And
the few that do usually are first editions of the most popular works
by the most enduringly popular authors.</TE>
<TE>   In that category: Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn," J.D. Salinger's
"Catcher in the Rye," Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter,"
Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe," Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's
Travels," Henry Fielding's "Tom Jones," Jane Austen's "Pride and
Prejudice" and John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath." Any of these
may easily fetch five figures.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 antiquarian booksellers--who deal in collectible
books, manuscripts, autographs, maps, prints and graphics--from
throughout the United States and Europe will offer their wares at the
35th California International Antiquarian Book Fair today through
Sunday at Airport Marriott Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the current interest in Rowling and Tolkien, there
will be a special exhibit of fantasy literature. And the antiquarians
will take a bold step into the 20th century (don't rush them) with
computer terminals to guide visitors to their favorite title or
author.</TE>
<TE>   Brass, who in addition to being the vice president of Heritage
Bookshop also chairs the area chapter of the Antiquarian Booksellers
Assn. of America, promises a variety of offerings in the $100-and-up
category for entry-level collectors. At the top end are a collection
of 70 handwritten essays by Ayn Rand for $500,000, a first edition of
Sir Thomas Moore's "Utopia" for $550,000 and a 1623 first folio
edition of "Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories and
Tragedies" for $650,000.</TE>
<TE>   Antiquarian book collectors are nothing if not eclectic. There
will be books on subjects ranging from American Indians to cookery to
gay literature to Judaica to the Middle East to avant-garde Russian
art.</TE>
<TE>   Among those expected to attend is Nicholas Basbanes, a collector
who has chronicled the lives of book collectors and booksellers in
two books of his own, "A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes
and the Eternal Passion for Books" (Henry Holt) and "Patience &amp;
Fortitude: A Roving Chronicle of Book People, Book Places and Book
Culture" (HarperCollins).</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview from his Massachusetts home, Basbanes, by
his own admission one of the "gently mad"--he has more than 10,000
volumes stuffed into every nook and cranny of his house--told of one
of the more notable collectors, Stephen Blumberg, a well-off Iowan
who had a somewhat unorthodox method of acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Blumberg, he said, was "the most notorious book thief of the 20th
century. He took 22,000 books from 368 libraries in 45 states, Canada
and the District of Columbia. He had a California Room in his house,
where he kept his favorite pickings," some of which were purloined
from the Claremont Colleges and USC. "An example of a bibliophile who
goes over the cliff, a cautionary tale," said Basbanes. "If he was
just another crook, stealing for greed and profit, I wouldn't have
been interested in him, but he was a collector," with a particular
interest in American Victoriana. Blumberg landed in prison and,
happily, most of those books landed back in their libraries.</TE>
<TE>   A "borderline bibliomane" himself, Basbanes has trouble explaining
the thrill of the hunt, but knows that "every time you pick up a
wonderful, beautiful book, something magical happens. Either you have
this disease or you don't."</TE>
<TE>   Among eccentric collectors he has uncovered are a man who collects
"nutty books," such as those printed on pasta or shaped like an
accordion, and a Midwesterner who set out to "get every copy of
'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' in every edition." He found more
than 1,000, and when he found no Yiddish edition, he commissioned
one. He has pledged his collection to Cornell University.</TE>
<TE>   "A true collector," Basbanes says, "is also a scholar. Every
collection is more than just a gathering of books. A collector is
really a storyteller and to become a storyteller you have to connect
the dots. Otherwise, it's just an accumulation of objects." Among
scholar-collectors he names L.A. arts patron Louise Taper as
"arguably the finest private collector of Lincoln"  books and
artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   For many, books are in the genes. Brass, born in England, is a
fourth-generation antiquarian bookseller whose family traces its
roots to an ancestor who had a bookstall in St. Paul's churchyard in
London in 1516. The Weinstein brothers, who founded the Heritage shop
in 1963, have three siblings who own bookshops. Benjamin's daughter,
Rachel, 26, who is a children's book specialist at Heritage, says, "I
was raised in this business. I can't imagine myself anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Once, an antiquarian book was, by definition, 100 or more years
old. Today, it may be only a few years old. And not all collectibles
are great literature. Heritage recently sold a first issue of
Playboy, December 1953, with Marilyn Monroe as the centerfold, for
$4,000.</TE>
<TE>   A new generation may focus on a certain book or author and create
a market. A generation ago, a first edition of Jack Kerouac's "On the
Road" in great condition might have brought $300; today, it would
bring $5,000 or more. Price is also determined by the original
supply. Among Ian Fleming's Bond books, the most valuable is "Casino
Royale," in which the Bond character was introduced--a good first
edition copy might bring $20,000. But "Octopussy" has little value,
as so many were printed.</TE>
<TE>   Your family Bible most likely is worthless on the collectibles
market, says Louis Weinstein, adding that most of the shop's query
calls are about family Bibles. "Sadly, many people pay safe deposit
fees for decades" to keep that Bible safe--then find out it's worth
$10.</TE>
<TE>   While first editions are, with few exceptions, the ones of
interest to collectors, "first edition in itself is not an indication
of value," says Louis Weinstein. "Ninety-nine percent of authors
aren't collectible." Condition of a book is all-important--and the
fewer restorations the better.</TE>
<TE>   Oddities, such as typographical errors corrected in later
editions, may add to value. Author autographs add value if the
author, like Tolkien and Kerouac, gave few. Others, like Joyce Carol
Oates, have autographed with such abandon that their signatures don't
translate to money.</TE>
<TE>   What's known in the trade as "presentation copies" are highly
desirable. That's when the author inscribes a book as a gift to a
friend. Heritage is offering a copy of "You Only Live Twice" signed
by Fleming to the real James Bond "from the thief of his identity."
Brass explains that a man named James Bond was a noted ornithologist
and that Fleming found his name in a bird book in his library and
fancied it for his hero. Asking price: $75,000.</TE>
<TE>   Hime is bringing to the fair from Biblioctopus a complete
collection of the 22 books of Edgar Rice Burroughs, including a copy
of "Son of Tarzan" inscribed to Burroughs' son. Asking price for the
set: $260,000.</TE>
<TE>   On a more contemporary note, Hime is offering Paul McCartney's
handwritten working manuscript for the song "Maxwell's Silver Hammer"
from the "Abbey Road" album for $145,000. Not a bad price, observes
Hime, considering that the British Museum so esteems Beatles
manuscripts that it has exhibited them right next to the Magna Carta.</TE>
<TE>   If there hadn't been rock 'n' roll, says Brass, the Beatles and
other top rock stars of the '60s "would have been the great poets of
that generation." In their wisdom, they determined that by setting
their poetry to music they wouldn't wind up as starving poets.</TE>
<TE>   Having paid thousands of dollars for a coveted book, does a
collector stash it away in a safe deposit box or display it in a
theft-proof cabinet?</TE>
<TE>   Not really. Most just stick their treasures on their bookshelves.
As Himes points out, "A thief is more likely to take your $300 VCR
than your $20,000 copy of 'A Christmas Carol.'"</TE>
<TE>   The 35th California International Antiquarian Book Fair will be
held 2-9 p.m. today, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m.-5 p.m.
Sunday at Airport Marriott Hotel, 5855 W. Century Blvd. Admission is
$5, with a three-day pass being offered today for $10.</TE>

<LD>   A History of Warfare Against</LD>
<LD>   Civilians: Why It Has Always Failed and Why It Will Fail Again</LD>
<TE>   By Caleb Carr</TE>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   272 pages, $19.95</TE>
<TE>   "The Lessons of Terror" is a provocative essay inspired by the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. It was written in haste and shows it.
The author, Caleb Carr, a novelist ("The Alienist," "The Angel of
Darkness") and contributing editor of MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of
Military History, is tentative in the book's beginning, as if he's
looking for his subject and tone.</TE>
<TE>   But by the end of the book, he has found both and presents them
briskly. Carr's thesis is simple and simplistic: Nearly all wars,
from the Romans to the present, have been "destructive," aimed at
civilians as well as fighting forces. As a result the angry and
defeated sides have in time responded in kind, leading to an endless
cycle of self-generating violence.</TE>
<TE>   The major exceptions to this melancholy history have been a few
imaginative exceptions by warriors and theorists whose contributions
Carr labels "progressive war." The most notable practitioner of
"progressive war" was King Frederick the Great of Prussia. This 18th
century monarch, whose wars united and enlarged his kingdom, Carr
writes, "devised the most powerful statement and proof yet that wars
were best fought for particular and realistic political goals by
soldiers whose restrained behavior would limit the impact of conflict
on civilians and thereby maintain or even win these citizens'
loyalty."</TE>
<TE>   By his example, Carr argues, and by the contributions of others in
the century of the Enlightenment, especially the German mercenary
Marshal Saxe, who fought for France, and the English general James
Wolfe, who drove the French from North America, the endemic savagery
of European war was tamed.</TE>
<TE>   Of course this kinder, gentler mode of war did not last long. The
upheaval of the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon brought
about the vast national mobilizations that predominate to this day in
industrial societies with enormous resources to be devoted to
slaughter. The American Civil War, Carr asserts, as do many other
historians, first demonstrated just how monstrously efficient modern
industrial war can be. The 20th century, from World Wars I and II to
more recent ones, have only confirmed the lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Carr argues, the lessons of the limited wars of the
18th century can yet be applied to the current global situation, to
the benefit of humankind.</TE>
<TE>   He draws on Frederick the Great and the book "The Law of Nations"
(1758) by the Swiss jurist Emmerich de Vatel to point out that the
art of war that they taught is--get this--very much like the United
States' effort to conduct its current war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The "essential principles of progressive war," Carr says, are
"refusal to target civilians, constant offensive readiness, the
ability to achieve surprise, an emphasis on discriminatory tactical
operations and the strength to act alone, if necessary, in order to
vigorously attend to our security."</TE>
<TE>   Carr is lavish with his praise of the Reagan administration
decision in 1986 to bomb Moammar Kadafi and scornful of the first
Bush administration's action against Iraq. Libya's Kadafi was pretty
well silenced, while Iraq's Saddam Hussein is still a powerful
threat. Carr praises, too, the invasion of Panama in 1989 to capture
Gen. Manuel Noriega.</TE>
<TE>   But Carr excoriates the CIA. He says it has rarely understood what
was happening in the world. He writes that, by its own actions, it
has caused immense damage to the United Sates. His most recent
example is the abandonment of Afghanistan by the United States after
the expulsion of the Soviets; from that wreckage, Carr says, sprang
Osama bin Laden. Carr's prescription: Abolish the CIA and create a
separate and special branch of service in the U.S.
military--comparable to the Army, Navy and Air Force,
presumably--devoted solely to special forces like those now employed
in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   It is impossible in a short review--or even in a long one for that
matter--to list the many great figures for whom Carr has contempt or
the surprising aspects of warfare of which he speaks well. The early
19th century military theorist Karl von Clausewitz was a greatly
overrated romantic, for example, while he regards the German
blitzkrieg of World War II as possessing aspects of "progressive
war." In the current atmosphere of shock and confusion, Carr
obviously has attempted to spark an explosion of ideas. In "The
Lessons of Terror" he has succeeded.</TE>

<HD>Oh, Say, Can You See? ... Not Anymore You Can't</HD>
<DH>The Capitol steps were closed during fall's crises,
shuttering a beloved postcard view of D.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID MONTGOMERY</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- It was a view, a vista, nothing more. But also nothing
less.</LD>
<LD>   Now, it has vanished, its passing barely noticed with so much else
going on these recent months. If a vista presents itself and no one
sees it, does it exist?</LD>
<LD>   "It's like they closed the rim of the Grand Canyon," says Kenan
Jarboe, a longtime Capitol Hill resident.</LD>
<TE>   "The American public owns that view," says Jeff Soule, policy
director of the American Planning Assn. "They deserve to have it."</TE>
<TE>   It was the view you got when you stood on the west terrace of the
Capitol, at the top of the steps, and surveyed the Mall.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Capitol steps are closed. The terrace is deserted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's closed indefinitely," says Lt. Dan Nichols of the U.S.
Capitol Police.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was made in October, shortly after anthrax reached
Capitol Hill. Limited tours have since resumed inside the Capitol,
but Nichols can't say how, when or if the outside terrace and steps
will reopen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's indefinite," he repeats. "We never like to say permanent."</TE>
<TE>   Let us now praise that cool classical geometry lesson, that
political landscape painting. The setting sun limns the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln Memorial in lavender and gold. The
presidential parade route, America's Main Street, cuts a determined
channel from "the people's house" to the president's mansion in the
distance. None of the sight lines is accidental. At a glance, take in
symbols of the nation's founding, the greatest test of its union and
its continued constitutional balance.</TE>
<TE>   So many experiences there involved simple pleasures. Sit on the
front stoop of democracy and listen to the National Symphony
Orchestra or the U.S. Marine Band or Leontyne Price or Johnny Cash.
Watch the fireworks, applaud the speech, join the protest, jog the
steps. Focus the camera on your family saying "Cheese" with the
obelisk appearing to rise out of their heads.</TE>
<TE>   It was the most breathtaking, significant perch in the republic,
and the details are already fading.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Law Olmsted, the great landscape architect who designed
Central Park, was summoned to Washington in 1874 to work on the
Capitol grounds. As he stood on the slope below the west side and
pondered the great building, he could tell what was wrong: The
Capitol looked as though it were about to topple off the hill.</TE>
<TE>   This was not an engineering problem but an aesthetic one. "There
is nothing more necessary ... in a building than that it should seem
to stand firmly, that its base should seem to be immovable," Olmsted
wrote, according to a new history of the Capitol by William Allen, an
architectural historian in the Architect of the Capitol's office.</TE>
<TE>   Olmsted's solution was the broad marble terrace, with a strong
wall beneath it and twin grand staircases leading down to the lawn.
The design not only improved the view of the Capitol from the Mall,
it also improved the view of the Mall from the Capitol, and it
strengthened the connection of the building to the rest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   The terrace was finished in 1892. The public responded
immediately, making the new space its own.</TE>
<TE>   "On summer evenings, when the heat drives the townsfolk from their
homes, there is no more popular resort than the terrace-promenade,"
an 1897 book on the Capitol reported, noting "the gay summer dresses,
and the chatter of the voices of the merry throng upon the steps and
along the balustrade, counting the stars or gazing languidly down the
long line of lights that mark the avenues and streets of the heated
city."</TE>
<TE>   The west front's prominence increased with each passing decade as
museums, monuments and landscaping transformed the Mall. Women's lib
advocates, Vietnam War protesters, Earth Day celebrants, gay-rights
advocates, demonstrators on both sides of the abortion issue--all
made their way here for a civic benediction of their causes.</TE>
<TE>   Newt Gingrich chose the foot of the Capitol steps to announce his
Contract With America; Louis Farrakhan addressed his Million Man
March from the same spot.</TE>
<TE>   The east steps always had a different meaning. Three small
staircases leading to east front entrances are used by members of
Congress heading to their chambers or giving news conferences. The
east steps are for news, the west steps are for history.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for a long time presidents were inaugurated on the east steps.
When President Reagan took the oath of office in 1981, the ceremony
was switched to the west terrace and steps, where it has remained
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Today that view is the exclusive property of congressional
leaders, who can survey the scene from their second-floor office
balconies, and of Capitol Police officers, who stand guard on the
Capitol steps.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Hantman, the Architect of the Capitol, did not return a
message left with his office to discuss the subject. His spokesman
referred all queries to Nichols of the Capitol Police.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you it's a proximity issue," Nichols says. "We have a
concern on the upper west terrace in particular. Beyond that, I can't
elaborate, for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We're cognizant of the symbolism of the Capitol itself, of the
view," Nichols says. "All those considerations are taken into account
when we make these decisions. Nonetheless, we have to make certain
decisions in order to protect the building itself, the institution of
Congress and all those who work and visit within the building."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Hugh Jacobsen, who designed the $19-million restoration
of the west terrace in 1993, says he understands elaborate
precautions to screen people going inside the Capitol. "But this is
the outside! What the hell is somebody going to do? No one can drive
a truck up there. God, it drives you nuts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best view of the city," he says. "It's just wrong."</TE>
<TE>   And: "They forget the symbolism. ... It is the center of the
United States, where all the laws come from, and you can't get to
it."</TE>
<TE>   Dorn McGrath, a professor of urban and regional planning at George
Washington University, used to take students to the top of the
Capitol steps to show them how democratic principles inhere in the
plan conceived by the capital's designers. Indeed, the view itself is
part of that plan. Citizens are supposed to be able to see and
understand their capital city.</TE>
<TE>   "That is just a terribly important vista," McGrath says. "They've
taken away a part of the national heritage."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Leader's Wardrobe Honors a Diverse Nation</HD>
<DH>Karzai is setting trend with cape, baggy pants, cap
representing regional clothing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Afghan's interim leader Hamid Karzai is getting as much coverage for
his colorful robe and lambskin cap as for his diplomacy. But as is so
often the case in fashion, the clothes have a deeper meaning. Each
piece of his outfit represents a different region of Karzai's
long-splintered country.</LD>
<LD>   The hand-woven silk robe, or chapan, is typical of those worn by
Uzbek and Turkman tribesman in the north. Karzai has been seen
wearing a green or purple one. The baggy cotton trousers (peran) and
long tunic (tunban) are from the southern regions of Afghanistan. And
the lambskin hat, a karakul, is characteristic of urban Kabul.</LD>
<LD>   "He has created this costume for himself representing different
parts of the country because he has been charged with unifying
various ethnic people in Afghanistan," said Noor Delawari, a banker
who came to the U.S. 33 years ago and lives in La Canada but is
planning to move back to Afghanistan to set up a bank.</LD>
<TE>   Mohammed Daoud, a United Airlines pilot from Malibu who has been
traveling with the interim leader for the past couple of weeks, said
Karzai, 44, is amused by the attention to his wardrobe. In Tokyo,
Daoud showed Karzai a newspaper story featuring his photo, next to
one of a Gucci model wearing a cape similar to a chapan. "Maybe we
should call it the Karzai look," Daoud suggested.</TE>
<TE>   People have always been fascinated by the way heads of state
dress, from Communist Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung to Jawaharlal
Nehru. When Junichiro Koizumi became Japan's prime minister last
year, his permed salt 'n' pepper hair catapulted him to rock star
status.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai is showing his people "he is not prejudiced; he is proud to
wear the clothes of a different ethnicity," according to Hasan Nouri,
president of engineering consulting firm Rivertech Inc. in Laguna
Hills and founder of International Orphan Care, a nonprofit which
provides assistance to Afghan orphans.</TE>
<TE>   People have taken notice. "He has a sense of himself as a visual
entity in the world," said Anne Hollander, a fashion historian and
author in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The pieces Karzai wears are common in Afghanistan, according to
Delawari. "You go to Mazar-i-Sharif and every man is dressed the same
way." But Karzai, who speaks flawless English, would probably wear
Western clothing if he were not a head of state, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's family is prominent in the Popolzai clan, part of the
Durrani tribe that has been linked to Afghanistan's royal dynasty
since the 1700s. He is also a Pushtun, the dominant ethnic group of
the country and the ousted Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Besides promoting unity, his diverse costume may be a way to
deflect criticism. "He's already been labeled as one who was
installed by Western powers, [so] wearing Western clothing would only
substantiate that propaganda," Nouri said.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Karzai is being called the "chic-est man on earth" by
Gucci creative director Tom Ford, not everyone in the Afghan American
community agrees. For some, tribal dress is a reminder of a divisive
time.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Taliban, during the previous government, officials
never appeared in public wearing native clothing, according to Sayed
T. Hashemeyan, a former professor at Kabul University who fled
Afghanistan for the U.S. in 1982. All government employees wore
Western dress. Only after 1992, when the moujahedeen took over the
country, did people begin wearing tribal dress again.</TE>
<TE>   "I've not seen the Afghan leaders appear in public in any other
way than Western dress, and I think we should go ahead with that,"
said Hashemeyan, who lives in Montclair, where he publishes the
bimonthly magazine Afghan Mirror. "Afghans in general prefer
modernity, and they would like their country to turn into a modern
country."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, political leaders have had to wear Western dress to
be respected on the world stage, said Patricia Anawalt, director of
the Center for the Study of Regional Dress at UCLA's Fowler Museum of
Cultural History. But that has changed, particularly in the Muslim
world, she said. "There is a new respect for national costume."</TE>
<TE>   Although Daoud said there are more important things to focus on in
Afghanistan, he said he would not mind if Karzai started a few
trends. "I would welcome it,"' he said. "It would prove that the
Western world is open to others. We've been adopting Western fashions
all these years, it's about time they take from us." And, he added,
"Hopefully that will translate into importing handicrafts."'</TE>

<LD>Buba Leah and Her Paper Children</LD>
<LD>   Chava and her great aunt, Buba Leah, lived in a small village in
Eastern Europe around the end of the 19th century. Buba Leah's
children had moved to America to find a better life. She loved
telling her niece about her beloved children. The children sent their
mom letters telling about America and saying that they still loved
her. Buba Leah called these letters her "paper children." Every time
the mailman came to the village, Buba Leah got another letter. This
made her very happy.</LD>
<LD>   One day, the mailman brought Buba Leah a special "paper children"
letter. Inside were tickets for Chava and Buba Leah to go live in
America!</LD>
<TE>   Maybe you have a grandmother or an uncle or a friend who lives in
another state or country. What can you do to show you love them? You
could write a letter or tell a story about something that you are
proud of doing. You could draw a picture of your classroom or
playground so they can see where you go to school. Think of something
you could do to let them know you are thinking of them. It will make
them very happy, just like Buba Leah's "paper children" made her
happy.</TE>
<TE>   You are invited to the Skirball Cultural Center at 2 p.m. Sunday,
Feb. 10, to hear Lillian Hammer Ross read her book "Buba Leah and Her
Paper Children." Afterward you can make a version of "paper
children."</TE>
<TE>   Call (310) 440-4636 for reservations. For general information,
call (310) 440-4500 or visit www.skirball.org.</TE>

<LD>So Mark Rudd is confused about the chickens coming home to roost
("Graying Radicals Are Facing New Ire in America," Jan. 28)? He says,
"They were living openly, right?"</LD>
<LD>   Certainly Kathleen Soliah, repackaged as Sara Jane Olsen, wasn't
living openly. She was undercover these decades later, as were most
cited at various stages before assuming innocuous roles and
reinventing themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Bernardine Dohrn and other Weatherman members certainly were not
abhorrent of violence in their earlier incarnations. And slipping
into bourgeois roles as convenience may suit should not serve as
absolution for folks who advocated and pursued the destruction of the
structures and institutions of this civilization. Now they serve on
faculties of law and continue to flaunt what they've co-opted to
their advantage.</LD>

of their homes, because Meieran is intent on catalyzing a "changing
demographic" in their neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Well, you can rest assured, Mr. Meieran. With two new Starbucks in
the neighborhood, people able and willing to pay half an hour's
minimum wage for a cup of coffee can't be far behind. The
minimum-wage workers living there now won't be able to afford it.</TE>
<TE>   Meieran blithely deludes himself that this changing demographic
"comes about entirely naturally." In reality, he buys a building,
raises the rent and displaces the low-income tenants.</TE>
<TE>   He describes this process as "problematic," explaining that he
doesn't want to displace people, but he wants to "upgrade the
buildings." Well, when you put it that way ....</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Men's Apparel Alliance, nearly at its wits' end over casual
Fridays, should take heart from the latest men's styles--polished
with a little edge--unveiled on Paris runways last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Ford, for the Yves Saint Laurent ready-to-wear line, offered
floppy and wide trousers worn with double-breasted, well-tailored
jackets. Hedi Slimane at Dior menswear also offered some
loose-fitting trousers, a departure from his usual slim-fit
silhouette. He paired them with short jackets ranging from military
to frock styles.</LD>
<LD>   Jean-Paul Gaultier's show was a homage to famous women who wore
men's clothes--the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Katharine Hepburn and
George Sand. There were hints of Hepburn in his belted pantsuits or
Marlene in his trench coats.</LD>
<TE>   The more formal looks ought to help the cause of James Ammeen,
president of the Men's Apparel Alliance trade group, who laments,
"The trend of casualization has gone too far." He says the
Hawaiian-shirt day has got to go.</TE>
<TE>   COVER GIRL: Sarah Jessica Parker, a fashionista in her own right,
and her alter ego on "Sex and the City," Carrie Bradshaw, the
ultimate fashionista, are both enjoying Vogue moments.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, wearing a Calvin Klein wool bodice and pants, is the
magazine's cover girl and story this month. The profile of New York's
"It Girl" chronicles the rise, fall and rise again of her spirits
from the Marc Jacobs fashion show on Sept. 10 through the holiday
season.</TE>
<TE>   "New Yorkers always have the right accessories; and this season
the two accessories that everyone is carrying are courage and pride,"
she is quoted as saying at a fund-raising dinner for a children's
charity held soon after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bradshaw goes to work for the magazine in an upcoming
episode of the HBO comedy. She heads off for her first day on the job
in a Vivienne Westwood suit that Vogue editors say is too
theatrically chic even for their office.</TE>
<TE>   What the show's costume designer, Patricia Field, did get right is
the look of Vogue's fictional editor in chief, played by Candice
Bergen. She wears a skirt that looks a lot like a Bill Blass number
made famous by real-life editor Anna Wintour. Bergen's character also
has a choppy bob hairstyle and Manolo Blahnik shoes that are quite
familiar-looking to the folks at Vogue.</TE>

<HD>Vintage Necklace Calls for New Look</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I have a squash blossom necklace made of
turquoise and silver that I've had since the early 1970s when they
were fashionable. Since it was an expensive piece, I'd like to
resurrect it. I have a black knit turtleneck top that I think would
show off the necklace beautifully. I'm also thinking of wearing a
pair of silver hoop earrings to complete the look. What do you think?</LD>
<LD>   --RECYCLING</LD>
<LD>   Dear Recycling: We're so glad you held onto that necklace. Silver
and turquoise are extremely popular right now, and the bold look of
the squash blossom necklace--made of turquoise nuggets and silver
beads with a horseshoe-shaped pendant at the bottom--is right in
style with current vintage fashions.</LD>
<TE>   But the funny thing about bringing back styles decades later is
that you can't wear them exactly the same way. It's the difference
between looking dated and looking retro. Some contemporary element
needs to be added.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of your turtleneck with the necklace, that would
scream 1970s, and not in a good way. There's a whole
prairie/Southwestern trend going on right now that will be huge come
spring and summer. That look is one way to go. A feminine
button-front blouse with a small ruffled collar would work, as would
a peasant-style top.</TE>
<TE>   These feminine pieces offer a nice counterpoint to the chunkiness
of the necklace. If you want to go whole hog with a Southwestern
theme, add jeans or a jeans skirt and a classic denim jacket or a
suede or leather coat in butterscotch. Check thrift stores for the
coats; you may come across some great vintage pieces at good prices.</TE>
<TE>   For a more conservative look, start with a plain white T-shirt,
add a jeans-styled linen jacket and a straight linen skirt or
drawstring pants. Try a sea-foam monochromatic color palette or
shades of ochre and russet, which will set off the necklace even
more.</TE>
<TE>   Other jewelry you wear with the necklace should be complementary
but shouldn't compete for attention. Simple silver hoop earrings or
small silver posts and a few silver bangles or a tooled leather
wristband will work well.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I have a question about the correct length of
a long skirt. I am 5 feet 3, wear a size 10, and enjoy wearing long
skirts, either A-line or straight. Most are not petite and hit me at
my ankle. Is that length OK, or should I hem them up? I usually wear
them with some type of boot.</TE>
<TE>   --LONGING FOR AN ANSWER</TE>
<TE>   Dear Longing: There is no "correct" length for a long skirt, which
can range from narrow stretchy looks to flouncy chiffon styles.
Lengths vary from mid-calf to grazing the foot, so the choice is up
to you. Lucky for you lots of labels are offering long skirts and
dresses for spring and summer, some in cool linens and cottons, with
touches of embroidery or little flounces at the hem. Here are a few
things to keep in mind:</TE>
<TE>   If you're wearing boots and you want the world to see them, your
skirt hem should end at least a little above your ankle.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to elongate your look, don't have any gap between
skirt hem and boot top, and try to keep them in the same color range;
black boots with a white skirt create a choppy effect. With shoes,
try to keep skirt, stockings and shoes in monochromatic shades. And
skip the patterned or textured hose, since that will break up the
line as well.</TE>
<TE>   From the Fashion Police Blotter: Some of you who shop at
LandsEnd.com and other sites are familiar with My Virtual Model,
technology that enables customers to build a virtual model of
themselves by supplying their measurements, hairstyle and skin tone.
Before buying an item, a customer can try it on the model to see an
approximation of how it's going to look.</TE>
<TE>   That technology will be available for plus sizes on PlusSize.com
(www.plussize.com), an online shopping mall featuring large-size
clothing from a number of designers and manufacturers, including
Elisabeth by Liz Claiborne, Lane Bryant, Spiegel and J. Jill.
Elisabeth, Ulla Popken, Size Appeal and Just My Size will be the
first labels to participate; others will follow. This should be up
and running by the end of the month.</TE>

<HD>The Key to Life? It's in a Handbag</HD>
<DH>The ultimate L.A. purse, a red and black 'trailer park'
Dior from Paris, carries with it a priceless lesson about how to
live.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't care what they say about the death of ostentation, the end of
luxury goods and the world's new emphasis on subdued elegance. I love
my insanely expensive purse--a Christian Dior "trailer trash"
bag--and everything it says about me, money and the value of being
fashionably idiotic.</LD>
<LD>   In hindsight, being shallow and irresponsible led to one of my
most satisfying shopping experiences. It's safe to admit that now.
Back in October, right when the world's sense of security was lost,
the idea of spending lavishly on luxury goods was not only
distasteful but very nearly disrespectful of the suffering on the
East Coast and in Afghanistan. Just when I and many of my fashion
colleagues were ready to shovel the dirt over fashion's long era of
luxury, this silly and fabulous purse has taught me a lesson about
enjoying life.</LD>
<LD>   As a self-supporting journalist, not an heiress who works for the
sport of it, I'm very careful with my cash. Years of traveling to
Europe haven't relaxed my grip, even when the foreign exchange rates
often cut the cost of designer goods by nearly 50%. Half of $2,000 is
still a lot more than I'm comfortable spending on a cotton shirt or
trendy ripped jeans. Even my financial advisor has to remind me that
savings exist to help improve the quality of life.</LD>
<TE>   Yet I had absolutely no intention of making a major purchase when
I wandered into the Dior boutique across from my Rue Bonaparte hotel
in Paris. Let's just say this: There's nothing like spending 24
consecutive days at the footlights of 50 designer runway shows to
drive your desire for a piece of catwalk fantasy. In the past, I had
never succumbed to temptation. I was immune to the mystique of the
practical Prada backpack and the allure of the glittering Fendi
baguette, impervious to the charms of the graffiti-splattered Louis
Vuitton tote. Though each of those handbags hit the top of fashion's
must-have chart at one time or another, for all their exclusivity,
they spoke of conformity.</TE>
<TE>   They were recognizable status symbols that announced the wearer's
dedication to a set of values that I'd often found distasteful.
Conspicuous consumption has kept me in a fashion job for years, so
I'm not especially against it--for other people. But what is the
sense of spending $500 or $1,500 on a bit of leather that will be
declared passe in six months?</TE>
<TE>   Sunglasses, on the other hand, are easier for a professional
tightwad to rationalize because they're an everyday accessory. So
before I even thought about a handbag that fateful fall day, I'd
consoled myself with a pair of mirrored, blade-style Diors that, when
I don't comb my hair, make me look like a dissolute rock star. The
$200 glasses scratched my shopping itch only for as long as it took
to sign the credit card receipt.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, I spied two teenagers in jeans, with scuffed
tennis shoes and ... sacrebleu! ... Dior handbags slung under their
taut little arms. These children possessed designer originals, and I,
a mature, hard-working, deserving woman, was a designer bag virgin.
That's when I weakened. Hanging in a window was a sickly green
version of the sculpted bag that I had seen on Dior's runway a year
earlier in John Galliano's controversial "trailer park" collection.
Critics unfamiliar with the trappings of lower-class America had
missed the wonderful irony in the show, which glorified the
unheralded status symbols of an often invisible class.</TE>
<TE>   Though Dior named my bag the "trailer," to me it's clear that
Galliano created the purses from the look of Cadillacs, once the
pinnacle of American success. He gave the bags perforated
tuck-and-roll upholstery, sleek car door handles, reflectors, a
mini-Cadillac steering wheel, a metallic finish and a license plate
that reads Chris 1947, for the year Dior opened his Avenue Montaigne
boutique.</TE>
<TE>   I asked the clerk innocently: Does that bag come in any other
colors? "Oui, madame." Out came the black and cherry-red version that
actually raised my heart rate. In red, it was the ultimate L.A. bag,
part vintage Cadillac, part Fender guitar. With that on my arm, I'd
possess fashion credibility, a valuable currency in my profession.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't even stop to calculate the francs. All I know is that on
Rodeo Drive, that bag sells for $1,200, more than my first year of
college tuition. Though the favorable exchange rate and a rebate of
the French value-added tax knocked as much as $400 off that price, I
feel like I got a bargain for another reason. It simply makes me
happy. Even better, it makes many other people light up with
amusement too.</TE>
<TE>   The first time I carried it in public, Rose Marie Bravo, the top
executive of Burberry, asked to inspect it and dubbed it "a marvel of
engineering." I actually received great, fawning service in every
Beverly Hills boutique I entered later that day, especially at Dior,
where I was handed a catalog of the collection (obviously I was now
perceived as a person of taste). I consider it entirely the work of
the bag that I was no longer invisible to clerks at Barneys New York
and Saks Fifth Avenue, where, shamefully, I have rarely been offered
assistance (maybe I should start combing my hair?).</TE>
<TE>   To strangers, the bag may have hinted that I was rich. More
important, it certified my style expertise, but not because it was a
recognizable, status bag to fashion insiders. Its whimsy was
infectious. A grandfatherly clerk at Rizzoli declared it "very
original'' as he smiled at it. The hip young chick at French
Connection suddenly had to know what shade of lipstick I was wearing
(it matched the red of the bag). Even the valet parking attendant
asked where he could buy one for his girlfriend. I coughed when he
asked the price and doubled his tip.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, with my new bag, I was younger, hipper, cooler, even
though by a teenager's count, I'm practically an old bag myself.
Buying that purse, and surviving guilt-free, helped pry open my
wallet for bigger, more important purchases. On the spur of the
moment a few days ago, I bought a house. Big flashy handbags may be
out of the question for a while as my husband and I juggle our new
financial profile.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that $1,200 could have bought the ultimate washer and
dryer, fresh backyard landscaping or an increase in my charitable
donations. When I head back to Paris for next month's collections,
I'm planning a return trip to Dior. There's this cute--and
affordable--accessory to my Cadillac purse: the matching license
plate key chain.</TE>

<LD>Bridgett shivered. She worried that she might meet up with the virus.
Virus or no, Bridgett was determined to get home.</LD>
<LD>   "What is keeping Bookmark, and what is that horrible smell?" she
wondered.</LD>
<LD>   Bookmark looked out over the Digital Highway and watched as the
virus drew near. It was as tall as a 12-story building and spewed out
a hideous-smelling gas as it destroyed everything in its path. A
black cloud moved slowly over the computer circuits, sucking up ones
and zeros and anything else in its way.</LD>
<TE>   "Bridgett, get out of the directory drawer! Meet me at the
computer screen portal!" Bookmark screamed.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett jumped out of the drawer. She wondered where to go. Two
zeros came and led her in the right direction. She could see through
the back side of the computer monitor a few feet away. Suddenly her
feet became liquid. She looked behind her. The dark cloud approached.</TE>
<TE>   Bookmark arrived. "You must go," he said, winking.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll be all right?" Bridgett asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Hit the virus scan when you get outside. Click," said Bookmark.
"Don't forget it!"</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett waved at the pixel family. Hard Drive slowed down the
moment Bridgett stepped through the portal. The odor hung on
Bridgett's clothes. She started the virus scan.</TE>
<TE>   When the scan was finished, she typed her paper. She pressed the
"save" button and printed her report.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett got her report done, but she learned an important lesson.
She learned that waiting until the last minute to write a paper can
be hazardous to your imagination!</TE>

<DH>Drawing on his background as a painter and set designer,
German director Achim Freyer is putting his bold, abstract stamp on
Bach's Mass in B minor for L.A. Opera.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine men and women of various shapes and sizes, dressed in workout
clothes and black platform shoes a la Frankenstein's monster, move in
slow, geometric patterns in a rehearsal room in the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion. They begin in an upstage line, raising first left, then
right arms in precise patterns and moving toward the downstage side
of the room.</LD>
<LD>   Their director, Achim Freyer, gives notes quietly in German,
refining their steps to modify the stage picture he is creating. An
enigmatic man with a mop of curly gray hair and an impish energy, he
adjusts their movements ever so slightly.</LD>
<LD>   The scene might easily pass as a dance rehearsal or perhaps
large-scale performance art. The room is quiet and devoid of
instruments; there is no music and no singing. And yet this is a
rehearsal for the latest offering at Los Angeles Opera: the North
American premiere of Freyer's production of Bach's Mass in B minor.</LD>
<TE>   This is Freyer's U.S. directorial debut, and it features the
Freyer Ensemble, and vocal soloists soprano Simone Nold,
mezzo-soprano Annekathrin Laabs, tenor Marcus Ullmann and baritone
Stephan Loges, with Bach specialist Peter Schreier conducting.</TE>
<TE>   Almost nothing about this production is typical. The work
itself--a seminal entry in the Western canon--is rarely taken out of
a concert setting and staged. Freyer's vision has none of the
traditional aspects of opera--the singing will be done from the pit,
for example. Then there is the rest of Freyer's abstract style, which
is neither representational nor linear, and his interpretation of
Bach's mass, which purposefully avoids the work's religious context.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an anatomy of the nature of mankind," says the director, who
is also a painter and set designer, speaking via Los Angeles Opera
director of artistic operations Edgar Baitzel, who served as his
interpreter during a recent interview. "It's about a desperate
attempt to overcome the solitude of mankind and the solitude of the
individual human being."</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Freyer's bold choices serve as proof that Los
Angeles Opera is venturing in new directions in this first full
season of programming under artistic director Placido Domingo. "Part
of the task of the arts is to extend and overcome borders and to risk
something," says Baitzel, who saw Freyer's Mass in B minor when it
premiered at Germany's Schwetzingen Festival in 1996, and brought it
to Domingo's attention. "We were very well aware that this piece
might be the most daring piece in our entire program."</TE>
<TE>   Interpreting Bach</TE>
<TE>   Bach's Mass in B minor is widely considered the composer's supreme
accomplishment. Despite creating a wealth of Lutheran church music,
Bach rarely set the Latin liturgy, and this massive work, begun in
1733, wasn't completed until 1748, two years before he died.</TE>
<TE>   Interpreters have often suggested a connection between Bach's
sacred music and the composer's spiritual convictions. But others see
this work more as Freyer does. "It really explores the human
condition," the director says. "It has to do with human feelings.
Every kind of politics and ideology works with the same
materials--it's archetypal material about an ongoing dance with
death.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Bach's music is in regard to religious scenes, it's not
only limited to this," he continues. And certainly not limited to
Christianity. "I think that this Bach music is understandable for
people who belong to other religions--not only Western religions."</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Freyer feels it would be reductive for him to
interpret the Mass in B minor as a mass, per se. "It becomes
literal," he says, "And that is absolutely not what I do."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Freyer's method begins with the sound itself. "The music
is the basis," he says. "I work first on the music, not on the text.
And at the end, I compare the text and sound with the action."</TE>
<TE>   The scenes onstage--there are 24, one for each of the numbered
movements in the work--and the music emanating from the pit exist in
relation to one another, yet this is not musical theater. In fact, it
is important to Freyer that his stage pictures are not regarded as an
attempt to illustrate the music. "The images of the music are not
doubled," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   In one scene, the men and women of the Freyer Ensemble appear as
faceless silhouettes, carrying long poles, coming together in a
formation that evokes some kind of collective labor. In another
moment, they are spaced across the stage, some climbing on ladders,
some in profile, and some facing outward, in a tableau that suggests
the varied activities of daily life or an ascent to a higher realm.</TE>
<TE>   The slow-moving bodies are complemented by Freyer's painted scrims
and his designs for dramatic lighting. Sometime the figures move in a
cool, almost sterile environment, and sometimes they swim through
lush baths of intense color.</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up to a kind of tightly choreographed, abstract,
imagistic spectacle theater. "Germany has been developing this kind
of work all along," Baitzel says. "But there is less of this in the
U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Here in America, the closest analogy to Freyer's work would be the
avant-garde represented by the such artists as Robert Wilson, Philip
Glass and Laurie Anderson, the latter two of whom have collaborated
with Freyer.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even in Germany, the question remains whether it is possible
to successfully add a visual component to Bach. "Can one do that?"
wrote Stefan Koch in the German newspaper Morgen, regarding the
work's 1996 premiere. In fact, Koch's query was echoed by a number of
reviewers. Koch added, "Must one invest an additional optical
enrichment after all to the work whose music by itself is so closed,
so hermetically complete? ... The result left me with ... a kind of
fascinated speechlessness."</TE>
<TE>   Careers in Theater and Art</TE>
<TE>   Born in Berlin in 1934, Freyer was in his 20s when he became a
student of playwright-director-theoretician Bertolt Brecht. He began
a career as a costume and set designer, emigrating from East Berlin
in 1972 to the West, where he soon forged a reputation as one of the
key designers of the emerging Bildertheater movement, a school of
stage artists highly influenced by the visual arts.</TE>
<TE>   Concurrently, Freyer also had a career as a painter, receiving his
first awards in the 1960s. With numerous solo and group exhibitions
to his credit since, he has participated twice in Documenta, a
contemporary art show in Germany, and is a member of the Academy of
the Arts in Berlin and Leipzig.</TE>
<TE>   By the late '70s, Freyer was concentrating on directing opera and
other musical works, including a Stuttgart staging of a Philip Glass
trilogy that garnered international acclaim. In 1988, he formed his
ensemble, bringing together actors, dancers, musicians and others for
extended rehearsal periods several times a year.</TE>
<TE>   "This ensemble is used in training and developing works," Freyer
says. "If I figure out that something doesn't work, then I work with
them on different approaches and ways that it might work. The
intention [is] to find new ways to expand, and new additions and new
ideas."</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble is designed to overcome limitations commonly found in
the institutional theater and opera houses. "If you work with
singers, for example, you have them for four weeks, and you cannot
expect that they will participate in [a] workshop," Baitzel says.
"You cannot expect first-class singers to be able to stay for 10
weeks in order to make it work for one production."</TE>
<TE>   Freyer's preferred working style may be one reason why his
productions haven't yet made it to the U.S. There are logistical and
financial difficulties in importing an entire ensemble to work on a
production, let alone providing the kind of artistic incubation
period that Freyer likes.</TE>
<TE>   But Freyer doesn't work only with his ensemble or in a completely
abstract mode. He also directs more traditional operas, and L.A.
Opera first considered bringing one of those productions here.
"Freyer did a wonderful 'Tristan' years ago in Brussels, but we
already had the [David] Hockney production here, so we could not do
it," Baitzel says. "The other thing that Placido liked very much was
his production of 'The Magic Flute,' but we had a 'Magic Flute' here
too."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, asking Freyer to create a new production didn't seem
feasible. "He is used to working with six, seven weeks or even eight
weeks of rehearsals if it's a very complicated work, and we cannot do
that because it costs too much money," Baitzel says. "But he still
remained on top of the list of artists that we wanted to present
here."</TE>
<TE>   During the planning of the first season's programming under
Domingo, it became clear that there was no production involving early
music. At that point, Baitzel recalled Freyer's Mass in B minor. "It
was televised, so I found a video, and when Placido looked at this
video, he said, OK, I think that is the right piece to fill our open
slot in that season."</TE>
<TE>   For Freyer, it represented an opportunity not only to make his
U.S. debut, but to revisit his production of the mass, which he's
been working on for the last month, modifying to fit the Chandler
stage. "He never delivers an exact duplicate of what he's done
before," Baitzel says. "He wants to be very sure that what he has
done is still valid."</TE>
<TE>   For L.A. Opera, it's also an opportunity to take the company in a
new direction without a great deal of financial risk. "It's an
artistic risk, but it's not a financial risk," Baitzel says. "It's
not a very expensive production.</TE>
<TE>   "Nevertheless, we have to look for a new audience that will
appreciate this kind of work," Baitzel continues. "That will indicate
for us if this is a direction in which we might go for the future. It
opens up different options. It does not necessarily mean that we will
have a staged work like this each season, but I think you can build
up something here, and new ideas will succeed."</TE>

<HD>A Sprawling Virginia Woolf Reading 'Room'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A towering and tormented figure, Virginia Woolf experienced life
through the distorted prism of her own troubled mind. As her writings
reveal, Woolf was subject to manic mood swings, periods of despair
countered by intense raptures--her most fertile artistic
periods--that led her to pour forth her swirling emotions into
precise, pointed prose. Her life ended in suicide, but Woolf's
enduring legacy of proto-feminist essays and stream-of-consciousness
fiction paved the way to the modern novel.</LD>
<LD>   "Room," the solo show about Woolf playing at UCLA's Freud
Playhouse through Saturday, is a fittingly unconventional yet pointed
treatment of Woolf's life and work, directed by Obie-winning
experimental director Anne Bogart. Bogart is perhaps most famous for
her development of the Viewpoints, an elaborate and arcane method of
theatrical training inspired by the teachings of Japanese theater
maven Tadashi Suzuki. The SITI Company, the New York City and
Saratoga Springs-based theater collective founded and headed by
Bogart, gets a "created by" credit for the piece.</LD>
<LD>   As with SITI's past works, "Room" is the result of an ensemble
process. However, the quorum of cooks only add more spice to this
rich intellectual stew, a free sampling of Woolf's own works
performed by longtime Bogart collaborator Ellen Lauren, the associate
artistic director at SITI.</LD>
<TE>   Frequent SITI collaborator Jocelyn Clarke adapted Woolf's works to
the stage. The flow of the narrative is appropriately sprawling,
mimicking Woolf's own famously digressive style. Yet at times,
Clarke's adaptation overflows its banks, especially with its
treatment of Woolf's childhood molestation, which is never adequately
integrated or explained.</TE>
<TE>   Inappropriate discursions aside, there is an overarching rigor to
the production itself, an uncompromising fine-tuning of pacing and
detail. The play commences as a conventional "lecture" before
spiraling into uncharted territory. Initially, Woolf/Lauren, our
"lecturer," stands motionless and erect, addressing the audience with
well-modulated restraint. Then suddenly, Lauren's head jerks, her arm
jerks upward, her body bends at a harsh angle.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren's masterly economy of movement, combined with Bogart's
unerring compositional sense, is breathtaking.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Patel's deceptively simple white box of a set--the famous
"room of one's own" that Woolf insisted was essential to any literary
endeavor--takes on unexpected depth through a back scrim. Christopher
Akerlind's virtuosic lighting emphasizes the abrupt changes of
subject with split-second precision. Darron L. West's evocative
"soundscape" is an integral background of music and sound.</TE>
<TE>   Like Van Gogh before her, Woolf spent a lifetime trying to capture
her manic epiphanies in her art. "Room" dignifies that struggle in
this indelible stage portrait.</TE>

<LD>NEWS ALERT:</LD>
<LD>   Good morning! This is Calendar Morning, where you'll find all the
news you need to know this morning in Calendar Morning. And so good
morning to you from Calendar Morning ... this morning.</LD>
<LD>   MORNING BUZZ:</LD>
<TE>   I'd like to praise me for the wonderful job I'm doing, an opinion
of me with which I heartily agree.</TE>
<TE>   TOP NEWS: I'm cranky.</TE>
<TE>   THE BIG QUESTION:</TE>
<TE>   Have I said good morning?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, brother.</TE>
<TE>   Have you checked out the new personality-obsessed, format-fixated,
talk-driven, graphics-screaming, self-adoring, dumbed-down,
less-news-is-good-news CNN? You know, the cable channel you can tune
in around the clock and hear chat and opinion responding to chat and
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has his "axis of evil," CNN its axis of egos, from
Aaron Brown to Paula Zahn to just-hired Connie Chung, whose switch
from ABC is getting the kind of attention by CNN that it would give
Osama bin Laden joining the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   "Connie Chung is on our side now!" crowed the host of CNN's
"American Morning With Paula Zahn" last week. How did Chung initially
help CNN? By giving Zahn someone else to interview.</TE>
<TE>   "CNN has always been first-rate in my office and my home," Chung
explained about changing networks. After finishing with Chung, Zahn
urged all in the studio to give their new CNN colleague a hand,
leading the applause herself.</TE>
<TE>   And they call this news.</TE>
<TE>   The network's new emblem is, indeed, "American Morning With Paula
Zahn," three hours notable for titling segments ("MORNING BUZZ" and
so on) in large block letters and enlisting the show's regulars as
shills by having them proclaim before each commercial break: "Stay
with us on 'American Morning.' We've got all the news you need to
know."</TE>
<TE>   Where is a laugh track when you need one?</TE>
<TE>   "Are we your morning habit now?" Zahn asked Senate Minority Leader
Trent Lott this week, lighting up like a slot machine after he made
the mistake of politely mentioning it was nice being on her show.
Later, she urged him to keep tuning in "AM," and thanked him "very
much for putting 'American Morning' on your morning agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Zahn is obviously CNN's lead pitchwoman in this barrage of
self-love.</TE>
<TE>   To foreign correspondent Christiane Amanpour in London: "I haven't
had a chance to tell you what superb work you did out of
Afghanistan." To White House reporter John King: "We very much
appreciate that follow-up report. We know the long day you put in
yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Three hours of this forced cheer (How many times can they say
"good morning"?) become a long day.</TE>
<TE>   After previously working for the Fox News Channel and CBS, Zahn
became famous at CNN recently for protesting being called "sexy" in a
network promo that was swiftly disavowed by management and revised.
Oh, please. If looks weren't a strong motivating factor in her
hiring--as they were a few years ago for Bill Hemmer, the baby-faced
anchor whose show follows hers--then her name is Paula Poundstone.</TE>
<TE>   Zahn has two sidekicks. One is chuckling Anderson Cooper, formerly
of ABC News, who looks like he rode over on a skateboard. Cooper is a
fumbling interviewer who presides over such segments as "FUNNY SIDE
UP" and recently faulted actor Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career judgment in
appearing in the movie "Snow Dogs." This from someone who arrived at
CNN after hosting ABC's "The Mole."</TE>
<TE>   A crease in the show's cheeriness, designated grouch Jack
Cafferty, is an ex-New York news anchor who works in his shirt
sleeves. He appeared plenty teed off this week when quizzing a
California Corrections Department official and an advocate for prison
health care about Stanford University Medical Center's controversial
decision to give a prison inmate a heart transplant while others
waited for hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Cafferty ended up frustrated when he didn't get the responses he
wanted from these guys who had no influence over the transplant
decision. "You really should talk to the people at Stanford about the
ethics," one told him.</TE>
<TE>   "Know what I think?" Zahn said. "Why don't we get these people on
from Stanford?" A lightbulb had clicked on over their heads. Yes ...
YES!!!</TE>
<TE>   It might have been worse. CNN could have named the series "Sexy
American Morning With Paula Zahn."</TE>
<TE>   Audience levels for all cable news, including CNN, are up from a
year ago. Yet CNN has been turning over personnel while redefining
itself to meet the challenge of its competitors, especially the
tenacious Fox News Channel, which in January surpassed CNN as the
nation's most-watched cable news network despite being available in 9
million fewer homes.</TE>
<TE>   CNN still has its share of aces, from the astute Larry King to
classy, experienced anchor Judy Woodruff to solid political reporter
Candy Crowley to perceptive Jeff Greenfield to relatively new Brown.
Coming over from ABC, Brown made his bones on CNN in the aftermath of
Sept. 11, and is a fine, thoughtful anchor when not carrying
chattiness to extremes and crashing like a computer.</TE>
<TE>   Which he did one night last week when opening his "Newsnight"
program with this profoundly newsworthy admission: "I'm cranky."
After which came a monologue about what a lousy day he'd had.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron, baby, sweetheart! Who cared?</TE>
<TE>   The problem, if you value messages over messengers, is that CNN
increasingly assumes that viewers do care and that faces on the
screen are at least as important to them as facts.</TE>
<TE>   Here is how CNN deceptively oversold Brown's Wednesday-night
interview with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura in the St. Paul capitol
building: "Two straight-talking Minnesota natives shoot straight from
the hip."</TE>
<TE>   From the hip, my eye. Instead, happily, came a routine interview
with Brown politely asking questions and Ventura responding. Yet why
did Brown feel compelled to open the newscast with a story from his
Minnesota childhood about being disciplined by his teacher after
running "screaming through the rotunda" during a sixth-grade field
trip to the statehouse?</TE>
<TE>   Cults of personalities have underpinned profit strategies of TV
news for more than three decades, which accounts for a tradition of
selling anchors to the public as icons and paying them scads more
than the mortals on the pavement who do much of the work for small
credit.</TE>
<TE>   As far as any of them becoming celebrities, it's unavoidable, for
the camera confers that status on whoever is in front of it. Yet for
years CNN resisted this phenomenon in the belief that news was
sacred, even if its reporters did tend to rush breathlessly from one
breaking story to another without offering much context. Formerly a
network that chose to celebrate its anchors and prominent reporters
only in moderation, CNN is now one at which news can do no better
than co-star with the camera-ready crowd that delivers it.</TE>
<TE>   Affirmation has arrived with Zahn, Chung (whose 5 p.m. newscast is
scheduled to begin in late March or April) and even Brown, whose
personalized style can wear thin.</TE>
<TE>   CNN News Group Chairman Walter Isaacson has said he wants CNN
"driven by personalities who are very compelling, interesting,
vibrant, lively."</TE>
<TE>   He omitted smart and informed.</TE>
<TE>   CNN is increasingly a talk-show network with less news than
opinion, much of it pretty lowbrow. Just how low must have been
apparent this week to viewers of CNN's noontime hour, "TalkBack
Live." Tuesday found a discussion of hot issues being led by chirpy,
juvenile-sounding CNN Headline News anchor Robin Meade, a former
local news star and Ohio beauty queen who kept calling her male
guests "you guys." Then Wednesday brought a dissection of President
Bush's State of the Union address led by Karyn Bryant, host of the
VH1 game show "Name That Video" and former host of the TBS series
"Movies for Guys Who Like Movies."</TE>
<TE>   Who's to say one of them won't someday join the CNN lineup as the
measured, low-key Woodruff's vibrant, lively successor on "Inside
Politics"?</TE>
<TE>   With more opinion come fewer news stories, meanwhile. But more and
more gimmicks, as excitement becomes the prevailing CNN motif.</TE>
<TE>   Every reading of news headlines is now titled "NEWS ALERT," the
"alert" signifying urgency, even if none exists. The same motivation
appears to be behind using "WAR ALERT" for all stories related to the
U.S. campaign against terrorism, no matter how insignificant. And to
further massage viewers' emotions, CNN has been slipping background
music into some stories, once a no-no there and at other responsible
news shops in the belief that it was dishonest to shape viewers'
perceptions with artificial stimuli.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of artificial, Chung resurfaced on "Larry King Live"
recently for what he billed as "her first in-depth interview." Hadn't
he watched her with Zahn?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the usually chummy King seemed a bit testy with Chung,
whose show will precede his in the CNN lineup, setting up a potential
battle with her for top guests. He wondered, for example, if she felt
like a "third rung" at ABC, where she usually trailed Barbara Walters
and Diane Sawyer in landing high-profile interviews. Was that a dig
at someone who could become a rival?</TE>
<TE>   Or was he just cranky?</TE>

<HD>Then and 'Now': PBS Chief's Vision Got a Reality Check</HD>
<DH>Television* The show was to be a centerpiece, but its
creation was as fractious as the network itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When Pat Mitchell took the reins of PBS in March 2000, she made a new
weekly public affairs series a centerpiece of her plans to
reinvigorate the Public Broadcasting Service. That show, "Now With
Bill Moyers," finally got on the air Jan. 18, but its arrival has
seemingly exposed inherent roadblocks PBS encounters when it attempts
to move quickly as a loose confederation of autonomous local TV
stations.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is the Friday-night "Now" far less ambitious than
Mitchell first envisioned but the chaotic process by which it got on
the air has alienated some public affairs producers and public TV
stations--including Washington's WETA, New York's WNET and Boston's
WGBH--whose leaders believe their ideas were shoved aside.</LD>
<LD>   The esoteric Moyers, who has tackled everything from the Bible to
chemical industry pollution in his long PBS career, is well respected
and a proven audience draw, but he is not the new talent PBS said it
wanted to develop. Even Moyers said he is doing the show partly
because it was the only compromise the fractious PBS system could
agree upon.</LD>
<TE>   "Pat said, 'You are the Switzerland of the system,'" he said,
referring to that nation's neutrality. Comparing the public
television system with a Balkan war, he added, "I didn't want
[Mitchell] to become a casualty."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, said that although she's heard the complaints, she is
encouraged the show is even on the air, proving that public
broadcasting is capable of reacting "in a way we haven't been able to
before. We actually can respond, change a schedule, put a new program
in. It may not be perfect," she said, but "Now" will "grow and get
stronger."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed series began with "Public Square," a sweeping
multimedia project that Mitchell unveiled in January 2001, recalling
the days of PBS' "Omnibus" program. The new two-hour weekly programs
would cover everything from the arts, books and popular culture to
politics, religion, economics and history, with online and local
community components. Grandly dubbed an "interactive national
conversation," it was to have interviews, documentaries,
investigative reports, performance art, even a cabaret singer.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Sullivan, executive producer of PBS' investigative series
"Frontline," was put in charge of the project and came up with a plan
that was ambitious and innovative by several accounts. But it had an
annual budget of about $20 million--an enormous sum in the bare-bones
public broadcasting climate. It also had the bad luck to be looking
for corporate and foundation underwriting at a time when even
established shows such as "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer" were losing
sponsors because of the difficult economy.</TE>
<TE>   As late as August, PBS was still saying "Public Square" would
launch in 2002, but no money was forthcoming. Then came Sept. 11, and
PBS quickly tapped its regular public affairs contributors--including
"NewsHour," "Washington Week in Review" host Gwen Ifill and talk-show
host Charlie Rose--for a number of well-received special reports.
Moyers' conversations with religious, academic and arts leaders
particularly resonated with viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan quietly returned to "Frontline" to oversee
fast-turnaround terrorism documentaries.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Mitchell and her programming team saw an
opportunity to get a public affairs show on the air. "We wanted to
come up with a plan for us to stay on the story for the long haul,"
said John Wilson, senior vice president and co-chief program
executive at PBS.</TE>
<TE>   However, it wouldn't be "Public Square." "It didn't seem like the
right environment to be raising money for that particular take,"
Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, PBS had another new program about to launch, "Life
360," which used a mix of documentary, humor and performance art to
explore themes such as "Food" and "A Place in Time," about fate.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell--who sources say pushed for an extensive last-minute
reworking of "Life 360" even before Sept. 11--asked the co-producers,
ABC News' "Nightline" and Oregon Public Broadcasting, to essentially
turn the program into an instant network-style newsmagazine
addressing issues such as the war on terrorism. After much
discussion, and amid what some sources said was ill will over the
changes already requested, the producers said no.</TE>
<TE>   "Nightline" executive producer Tom Bettag said the show declined
because "we were so overextended" putting on the nightly ABC show.
"We were just not in a position to throw out everything 'Life 360'
was and start from scratch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said that it soon "became very clear we were asking 'Life
360' to do something they were not created to do," and possibly
"dooming [it] to miss the mark." As it turned out, the program
struggled to find an audience anyway and has been pulled until
summer, replaced by the Moyers show.</TE>
<TE>   PBS then put out an informal call for proposals from its regular
public affairs contributors. Because Moyers was simultaneously trying
to launch his own weekly show, Wilson said, PBS made a Moyers
interview segment a "must-have" for any proposal, along with input
from National Public Radio correspondents, a collaboration NPR and
PBS had long been seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Many producers responded enthusiastically, including WETA in
partnership with "NewsHour" and WGBH, which put together a plan with
New York Times Television. Sources say WGBH and the New York Times
even felt at one point that they had essentially been given a
commitment for the show, only to have it abruptly disappear.</TE>
<TE>   A WGBH spokeswoman said only that "we're happy with the direction
['Now'] has gone and it's off to a good start." Wilson said there was
no commitment. "We seriously considered a lot of things."</TE>
<TE>   Moyers got the nod, Wilson said, because PBS knew it wanted him to
be part of any show, and "increasingly, as we chased down ideas and
avenues, it really became clear that if we wanted Moyers at the hub"
the entire show should be based out of his production company, Public
Affairs Television. As an added advantage, Moyers was able to bring
corporate funding from Mutual of America Life Insurance Co., which
helps underwrite most of his projects.</TE>
<TE>   Moyers, Wilson said, "could negotiate the waters between and among
all of the many major producing stations" and get input from them as
well as others. "Frontline," for one, is contributing to tonight's
show with a previously taped but not aired interview with former
Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay about his meeting with Vice President
Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   As for complaints about the process, Wilson said, "Sure, it was
chaotic, but there wasn't time to hold panel discussions and have
everyone meet in a room in the Chicago Hilton to talk about it. We
had to get it on the air and ... we had to move at a pace than what
we otherwise might do."</TE>
<TE>   As for criticism that "Now" represents an established PBS voice as
opposed to a new one, Mitchell said, "My answer is that Bill is the
best, most recognized, most respected person we have in terms of
public affairs, so why not start with our best foot forward and add
the new to that?"</TE>
<TE>   Moyers said when Mitchell approached him about taking over the
entire production, he told her he couldn't do it because his company
was too busy. Feeling "badly about having let her down," he changed
his mind a week later. "I don't have that much time left in the game,
and I want to see her succeed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Siceloff was recruited from ABC News' "Downtown" newsmagazine
to produce the show, which Moyers calls a work in progress. Mitchell
said that although initially she had more ambitious plans, there will
be more opportunities to go further. "Now" may even get extended into
the 10 p.m. hour with live interviews, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "With Sept. 11, we had to reset our expectations and our needs,"
Wilson added. "'Public Square,' like 'Life 360,' was conceived at a
time of peace and prosperity.... This was a very different concept
than we found ourselves needing on Sept. 12."</TE>

<TE>   "Now With Bill Moyers" airs tonight at 9 on KCET.</TE>

<HD>Scheduling Prompts an HBO-NBC Tussle</HD>
<DH>Television* The pay channel takes issue after the network
makes plans to air a Matthew Shepard movie opposite its own.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After taking aim at "The Sopranos" last year, NBC has again irked
Home Box Office officials--this time by scheduling a fact-based movie
about the 1998 slaying of gay youth Matthew Shepard to run the same
night HBO was going to run its own movie related to that topic.</LD>
<LD>   HBO announced a few weeks ago that "The Laramie Project," adapted
from Moises Kaufman's stage play based on interviews with townspeople
about the much-publicized murder, would premiere March 16. Earlier
this week, NBC tentatively selected that night for "The Matthew
Shepard Story," which stars Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston as
the title character's parents and was originally earmarked for
October.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at HBO reacted by saying that NBC is either trying to
undermine their film or piggyback on the pay channel's publicity and
promotion. They were especially puzzled that NBC would slot its
production on a Saturday, when HBO traditionally launches movies and
NBC normally broadcasts theatrical films because of the night's lower
viewing levels.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Albrecht, HBO's president of original programming, said the
films explore complementary sides of an important issue and NBC's
scheduling would do a disservice to both. "It's taking this whole
one-upmanship thing to a new low," he said. "I'm just surprised that
they would damage their [own] movie ... and sacrifice what should be
an important project for the sake of I don't know what."</TE>
<TE>   NBC, however, maintained the network was unaware HBO had chosen
the same date and that the scheduling was happenstance, not a
counter-programming strategy. "Why would we ever pay attention to
them?" said NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker, alluding to the
channel's modest ratings relative to the major networks, adding that
the Saturday airdate does not reflect a lack of faith in the NBC
movie, whose producers include actress Goldie Hawn.</TE>
<TE>   Albrecht said HBO will likely shift "Laramie" to a different night
but hasn't made a final decision. Zucker said NBC has yet to lock in
the date with affiliates and a move is possible, agreeing that the
movies shouldn't run the same night.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Seomin, entertainment media director of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation, lauded both films but expressed
disappointment over the scheduling fracas. "If they're competing
against each other, no one wins," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This is only the latest skirmish involving the two networks. Last
May, NBC Chief Executive Robert Wright wrote members of Hollywood's
production community soliciting feedback regarding HBO's "The
Sopranos." Accompanied by a tape of a particularly explicit episode,
the letter noted that the pay television drama is "a show which we
could not and would not air on NBC because of the violence, language
and nudity."</TE>
<TE>   Wright insisted he was simply trying to provoke a dialogue about
the hit program's cultural significance and what that might mean for
network television, but HBO executives suggested there were ulterior
motives, among them expressing disapproval of "The Sopranos'" content
prior to voting for the Emmy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   HBO officials also intimated that NBC executives were annoyed when
the pay channel nearly swept the recent Golden Globe Awards, which
were televised on NBC. Zucker laughed off that notion, saying HBO
should stop worrying about NBC and "go get itself some viewers" for
best drama winner "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcast networks have become increasingly aggressive in seeking
to torpedo rival networks--a mind-set most recently demonstrated when
ABC and Fox raced to get similarly themed quiz shows "The Chair" and
"The Chamber," respectively, on the air first. For its part, NBC is
running a special Playboy model edition of "Fear Factor" Sunday
versus Fox's coverage of the Super Bowl halftime show and has let
episodes run beyond their usual end times--bleeding into the next
hour--to siphon viewers from competitors. Still, HBO generally draws
a smaller audience and has been immune to such actions.</TE>
<TE>   MTV televised its own movie on the Shepard case, "Anatomy of a
Hate Crime," in January 2001.</TE>

<LD>   'Apes' Extras File Class-Action Suit</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of extras who appeared in Tim Burton's 2001 "Planet of
the Apes" remake allege they were exposed to a carcinogenic powder
used by special-effects crews to create a "dust storm," according to
a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   In the proposed class-action complaint, plaintiff Jeffrey Clark is
seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of
those who were allegedly exposed to "approximately 80,000 pounds of
'Fuller's Earth' powder containing a lung irritant and the known
carcinogen crystalline silica for eight hours a day during the
shoot." Since then, it said, the $8-an-hour extras have continued to
suffer "irritation, both acute and chronic, to the lungs and
respiratory system."</TE>

<TE>   Cruise Lobbies for Scientologists</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Embassy officials confirmed Wednesday that Tom Cruise, a
vocal advocate of the Church of Scientology, met with U.S. ambassador
to Germany Dan Coats last week, asking that he support the group in
its fight with the German government.</TE>
<TE>   The actor was in the country promoting his latest film, "Vanilla
Sky," with co-star Penelope Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Germany refuses to recognize Scientology as a church, contending
that it masquerades as a religion to make money. Scientologists are
banned from holding government jobs in some parts of the country, and
the group was placed under official public scrutiny in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In the January issue of Vanity Fair, Cruise credited his 13-year
devotion to Scientology with helping him deal with dyslexia and his
estrangement from his late father. The church, which claims 8 million
members worldwide, has denounced German treatment of its 30,000
adherents in that country, as has the U.S. government.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Gallery Showcases Famous Ad Campaigns</TE>
<TE>   When G. Ray Hawkins was looking for a show to open his gallery,
which he just moved from Santa Monica to West Hollywood, he opted to
showcase the work of Howard Zieff--the New York City ad
icon-turned-film director whose work had never been exhibited.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins, in fact, had never heard of the man before December, when
a customer offered to trade his Zieff collection for some 19th
century prints. He was intrigued by Zieff's stills for "You Don't
Have to Be Jewish to Love Levy's [Rye Bread]" and, even more, by
Zieff's campaign for the New York Daily News from the 1950s that
adorned bus stops and subway stations.</TE>
<TE>   "Each has a complete story, with a setup and a punch line,"
Hawkins notes. "A shoeshine man is about to grab a customer's white
bucks with his stained hand as he leans in to read the newspaper.
Howard was the top guy in advertising in the 1950s, someone who

<HD>Laurie Anderson's 'Happiness' Spins Stories out of Silence</HD>
<DH>The artist ponders lack of sound in self-aware tales aided,
not overwhelmed, by electronic gadgets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Laurie Anderson owes technology's toys a thank you or two. Without
her eccentric electronic sounds and images, she likely would not have
become the first and still the only performance artist to catch the
fancy of a large public (at least by art world standards). Nor,
without technology's help, might she have become quite so interesting
a musician.</LD>
<LD>   But technology has not, it appears, bought her happiness--at least
it has not in her latest work, "Happiness," which was given its world
premiere Wednesday night in Campbell Hall at UC Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   The 95-minute performance, which will now begin an extensive tour
(it comes to UCLA's Royce Hall on Feb. 9), is not exactly
low-tech--there are enough machines with their glowing lights
attached to her electronic keyboard to make it, maybe, medium-tech.
But compared with her latest multimedia opera, "Songs and Stories
From 'Moby-Dick,'" in which she often seemed overwhelmed by gigantic
visuals and trapped on the rock 'n' roll treadmill of a blasting
backbeat, the new performance piece feels almost like sitting around
an electronic hearth with a masterful, appealingly obsessive
storyteller.</LD>
<TE>   "Happiness" is a series of glimpses from Anderson's recent
experiences and how those experiences have caused her to recall her
past. Anderson has always been an eagle-eyed observer of people and
places.</TE>
<TE>   Attending her epic four-hour multimedia opera from the '80s,
"United States," could feel like one was being magically dropped here
and there around the country for quick, surprising glimpses of this
or that.</TE>
<TE>   Before there was any chance of settling in, we were plucked up and
spirited away to some other place. It was a postmodernist voyeur's
paradise, with Anderson as our offbeat, engagingly cocky guide.</TE>
<TE>   In "Happiness," a more mature and self-aware Anderson sheds a
protective layer or two from her psyche as she reads short anecdotes
about her life and observations from the past year.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 30 years, her home has been the downtown arts scene
in Manhattan. She watched and heard the World Trade towers being
built from an apartment two blocks away. She now knows a changed
world from a home 10 blocks from ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   These are among the experiences Anderson, illuminated on a dark
stage, recounts while noodling inoffensive drones on her sampler and
keyboard. She occasionally plays her electronic violin, creating
waves of variously ominous and comforting sounds. Once or twice, she
breaks into a haunting sung refrain. And she cannot resist, at one
point, putting a light bulb in her mouth--she is, after all, Laurie
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   But mainly she talks, and the talk, at its most eloquent moments,
approaches music.</TE>
<TE>   For all her invention with imagery and love of gadgetry, Anderson
is a Minimalist at heart (she is the absolutely ideal reader of Don
DeLillo's disturbingly spare prose in a recent audio book of the
novella "The Body Artist"). Those gadgets, such as the Vocoder that
makes her voice deep and masculine, are the tools of a trickster. But
in "Happiness," Anderson seems searching, if not for truth or answers
exactly (she's too cunning for that), at least for honesty and
directness.</TE>
<TE>   She realizes she is not going to learn much from machines.
"Computers are stupid," she says, because there is no such thing as
digital silence. They are either off or on, whereas when humans say
nothing, there is still plenty going on with them.</TE>
<TE>   So part of her quest has been to come to terms with silence. She
volunteers to help out on an Amish farm and watches an angry family
wordlessly fume for days on end at the kitchen table. She takes a
two-week canoe trip with silent Buddhists down a river in Utah, only
to be confronted by environmentalist guides who never shut up, each
sincere group equally inflexible in its own way.</TE>
<TE>   She finds happiness in surprising places, working for a couple of
weeks at McDonald's, where she expects a kind of cynical artistic
silence in mindless mechanical labor and discovers a surprisingly
glimpse of happiness. For the first time in her life, she finds she
can give people exactly what they want.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 reveal to Anderson the most striking
example of the power of silence. How many of us noticed that the
horrifying images we all saw on television over and over again that
day lacked a soundtrack?</TE>
<TE>   She wonders whether the mikes weren't on, whether the cameras were
too far away, or whether the screams and the deafening explosions
were simply unrecordable.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the silence that made the images dreamlike, that made
it possible to watch them in endless loops, that mesmerized us.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson tells us more about herself in "Happiness" than in any
other work. But in doing so, she also tells us important things about
ourselves and what we have all experienced over the past few months.
In a voice that falls somewhere between speech and song, Anderson
says what needs now to be said in exactly the way it can be best
heard.</TE>

<BD>TIMES FILM CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Birthday Girl" is something rather different, both for star Nicole
Kidman and for us. It's an adventurous, unsettling, heedlessly
implausible film, equal parts comedy, romance, excitement and raw
emotion. In a fierce black farce, "Birthday Girl's" remixing of
traditional genre elements tells you from frame one that a
distinctive film sensibility is at work.</LD>
<LD>   That sensibility belongs to British director Jez Butterworth, who
wrote the film with brother Tom and recruited brother Steve to work
as producer. Jez also wrote his directing debut, 1997's "Mojo," which
won numerous British theater awards as a play, and he is nothing if
not fearless in his casting. For Nadia, a Vampirella-in-spiked-boots
Russian mail-order bride, Butterworth went with Australian Kidman.
And he picked two young stalwarts of the French film industry, actor
Vincent Cassel and actor-director Mathieu Kassovitz, for the film's
other pair of Russian characters. It's a tribute to how intriguing
all three performers found the project that everyone learned to speak
the language convincingly to get their parts.</LD>
<TE>   Despite this international flavor, "Birthday Girl" is set in the
very English Hertfordshire town of St. Albans, where young John
Buckingham (Ben Chaplin of "The Truth About Cats and Dogs") works
long and tedious hours as a bank teller. A sad-eyed, timid soul whose
biggest problem is an ant infestation in his tidy home, John despairs
of finding a mate in the neighborhood. So, in an act he considers
"quite brave," he sends a video off to the endless steppes of Russia
in search of a mail-order bride. "Someone you can really talk to" is
what he's looking for. After all, "communication is the key."</TE>
<TE>   When dark-haired Nadia shows up at the local airport, she is
definitely not what John bargained for. Resembling a man-eating
spiderwoman and not speaking a word of English, Nadia dresses a bit
like a hooker and considers the Russian-English dictionary John
helpfully provides as useful only for squashing those wayward ants.</TE>
<TE>   Terrified of what he's gotten into, John tries to return Nadia
like an unsatisfactory Fortnum &amp; Mason's fruitcake. That proves
tricky, especially after Nadia discovers and caters to his kinky
sexual preferences. Alternately frightened, bewildered and delighted,
John can't decide if he's fallen in love or just found a
flesh-and-blood sex toy. And that's just the start of his confusion.</TE>
<TE>   When a besotted John plans a birthday party for Nadia, who should
show up--and ask to stay a while--but her long-lost cousin Yuri
(Kassovitz) and Yuri's obstreperous new friend Alexei (Cassel). John,
who doesn't want to share Nadia with anyone, is aghast at the
invasion of two feckless louts whose motto is "plans are for
architects." "Boisterous" is a mild word for this pair's shenanigans,
but the moment John finally feels he's had enough is the point at
which "Birthday Girl's" plot really begins.</TE>
<TE>   For, complex though it may sound, the above is merely a prelude to
"Birthday Girl's" main action. That surprising series of constantly
changing events moves so fast--and so enjoyably--it's hard to notice
or really care that it doesn't necessarily make a whole lot of sense.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping us involved are the uniformly fine performances of this
polyglot cast, starting with the convincingly Slavic and always
entertaining Kidman, who has considerable fun as the strong-minded,
intrepid woman no man can resist.</TE>
<TE>   As for the men in her life, Chaplin is adept as the buttoned-down,
follow-the-rules functionary who's gotten himself into something
wild, while Kassovitz and Cassel, friends in real life, add a
believable touch of bizarre comradeship to their portrayal of
stereotypical Russians on the make.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Birthday Girl" is probably too unnerving and at times
savage a relationship comedy to be a universal taste, its success on
its own terms says a lot for the gifts of director-writer
Butterworth. He guides us through the world of chaos and romantic
confusion he's created as if it's the most natural place in the
world. After a while, we actually believe it is.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes an idea gets repeated so often that we become numb to it.
We begin to assume it's true, even if it's not.</LD>
<LD>   Case in point: George W. Bush isn't going to repeat his father's
mistake and appear indifferent to a troubled economy.</LD>
<LD>   This gospel, preached in Washington, has assumed a validity not
entirely warranted. To begin with, it distorts what happened to
Bush's father. Among many political forces at play in 1992 was the
widespread perception that the elder Bush failed to understand the
anxieties of Americans caught in economic uncertainty.</LD>
<TE>   That proved true. But it wasn't the case of Bush ignoring the
economy in the big sense of the word. He spoke about it frequently.
The fact is, Bush's policies were advanced and defeated by
contrasting proposals that gave voice to the everyday concerns of
individuals and their aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when the senior Bush was baffled at the sight of a
grocery store scanner? That gave Bill Clinton a crack to pry open.
Despite good-ole-boy mannerisms and his taste for pork rinds and
Tabasco, Bush was seen as a patrician apart from and above the daily
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Today, no matter how many times we hear that his son is doing
things differently, he's not.</TE>
<TE>   In his approach to the economy, George W. Bush's State of the
Union speech this week was an eerie echo of his father's--tone deaf
to the anxieties and aspirations of most of the people I know.</TE>
<TE>   Tax cuts for the wealthy were an economic cornerstone of former
President Bush's final State of the Union speech in 1992 and of his
son's first in 2002. Both sought to couch these in populist terms.
Both presidents called on Congress to maintain wartime bipartisanship
for the sake of trickle-down tax breaks for business--with both
backing the same reduction in the alternative minimum tax that is
supposed to thwart tax shelters. Both called for expanded health care
for Americans but in words that seemed perfunctory rather than a
priority. Both rose to lofty rhetorical heights in praise of the
character of Americans, without ever speaking of the corresponding
decline in the character of American business. Both spoke of
short-term increases in unemployment benefits.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, this father-son approach to governance seems even
more out of touch now.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has torn the scab off a festering social injustice: exposing
the fact that business has become as big and corrupt a tyranny as
government ever was.</TE>
<TE>   George W. Bush may wish to reduce Enron to nothing more than an
example of the need for accounting and pension reforms, just as his
father wanted to tinker with the banking regulations to ease a credit
crunch, but I believe many Americans view it more expansively. Enron
isn't just a company run amok; it is emblematic of greed, of the
folly of wholesale deregulation, of high-flying tycoons whose
entitlement to millions makes them only more rapacious, of the
distorting power of campaign contributions and lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   The state of the union in 2002 is this: too many hard-working,
decent people realize that they are powerless and aren't getting a
fair shake anymore. You can say the same thing for hard-working,
decent businesses that can't keep up with the unrealistic, and
perhaps fraudulent, growth of those that cut corners.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, government was blamed as the heavy-handed instrument
that undermined the values of honest work with schemes to
redistribute income and institutionalize welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Today, government is wide open to the reverse charge: The values
of honest work have been undermined by wheeler-dealers who operate
their own income redistribution schemes without public checks and
balances.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, then-President Bush spoke of the economy and told
the nation: "The power of America rests in a stirring but simple
idea: that people will do great things if you set them free."</TE>
<TE>   History and Kenneth Lay proved that this is not always the case.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Bush's remedy for hard times in 1992 was this:
"We must make it easier for people to invest money and create new
products, new industries and new jobs. We must clear away the
obstacles to growth--high taxes, high regulation, red tape and, yes,
wasteful government spending."</TE>
<TE>   This week, far from parting company with Dad, his son stuck with
the doctrine almost to the word.</TE>

<AU>JAMES K. FLANAGAN</AU>
<BD>James K. Flanagan is completing a novel on priests and
pedophilia titled "Bless Me, Father." He teaches writing at Asbury
Park High School in New Jersey.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was a poster child for growing up Catholic. A redheaded altar boy
taught by nuns in grammar school and by Jesuits in high school, I was
in the seminary for a year, went to a Catholic college and finished
with a PhD from Notre Dame. In my hometown of Jersey City, people
still ask, "What parish are you from?" And like me, many of them got
married in the same church where they were baptized.</LD>
<LD>   The priests I met in those days were a decent lot, but you might
meet a few who fell short: a mean one, a drinker or one with an eye
for the women. But whether it was luck, innocence or the grace of
God, in my youth and young manhood I never met a priest who was a
pedophile.</LD>
<LD>   Pedophile priests--the phrase brings instant and visceral
reaction: anger, revulsion, fear.</LD>
<TE>   For Catholics, it's a special kind of horror; for all people of
goodwill, it's a dual tragedy: the violation of a child and the
betrayal of a trust.</TE>
<TE>   No matter where in the spectrum of judgment we place the
pedophile, as a sick person or one who calls forth that rare thing in
the New Testament, the anger of Christ--"But who so shall offend one
of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that
a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were drowned in the
depths of the sea" (Matthew, 18:6)--our reaction after the rage of
discovery is simple but confused. First, help the victim, and then
deal with the violator.</TE>
<TE>   But what should we do? And how?</TE>
<TE>   To find some answers, I called some thoughtful friends (devout,
rebel and doubtful Catholics and ex-Catholics) and found an
unsurprising unanimity.</TE>
<TE>   A married ex-priest in California, a father of four in Illinois, a
mother of two young boys in Massachusetts, a nurse practitioner, a
mother of a college-age daughter in New Jersey and a New York
playwright with a just-finished script about pedophilia in New
York--all demand that the pedophile must be stopped and removed
instantly and permanently from contact with children.</TE>
<TE>   All of them insist on the same thing: Get the child and his family
immediate, unstinting and effective care.</TE>
<TE>   But it is what they say in tones strong and unequivocal to the
Catholic Church's hierarchy that is the most telling: You must stop
the cover-up.</TE>
<TE>   That mother of two learned that two cardinals, several pastors and
uncounted priests knew of scores of accusations of pedophilia against
now-defrocked priest John Geoghan, and all that these men of the
cloth did was to turn a blind eye or ship him off to another parish
in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   The ex-priest speaks of friends who are still priests who now feel
a blanket of suspicion weighing them down.</TE>
<TE>   Gone now is the image of a wholesome Father Flanagan founding Boys
Town to rescue the country's abandoned boys, or of Hollywood's Bing
Crosby as Father O'Malley saving kids from the slums though the
clean-cut power of sports and song.</TE>
<TE>   And there were many decent priests like them scattered in parishes
across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Both the college girl's mother and the nurse practitioner speak of
their frustration with the Catholic hierarchy's historical eagerness
to ignore the moral dirt.</TE>
<TE>   As our conversations progressed, all my respondents, not
surprisingly, reached a point where they acknowledged that from all
they knew--and this is supported by the research--pedophilia cannot
be cured but only contained.</TE>
<TE>   No pill, no psychotherapy, no prayers have availed.</TE>
<TE>   Again with unanimity, they showed a pity, sometimes grudging, for
the pedophile priest and called for a treatment that would both work
on his diseased psyche and keep him forever away from children.</TE>
<TE>   But the doubts linger, and the notes of dismay and cynicism are
still heard.</TE>
<TE>   In all the maneuvering and justifying and qualifying about who
knew what and when, I can imagine the anguished voice of a violated
child, a child who suffered his moment of betrayal in Father's room
on a tragically memorable afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   I can imagine the kid who went on a camping trip with Father and
who has been afraid of the dark ever since.</TE>
<TE>   I can picture the child who can't receive Communion anymore
because the hands that would carry the host to his lips are the same
ones that touched him.</TE>
<TE>   And when one of these children hears all the lawyers and all the
pastors and all the bishops and all their defenders, and when he
later remembers that the only thing that happened to Father was a
transfer to another parish somewhere, can you blame him when he turns
back to his private hell and whispers to all those defenders of the
establishment Church: "Your actions speak so loudly, I can't hear a
word you are saying."</TE>

<HD>Ask Jordan to Take Over the Territories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER REICH</AU>
<BD>Walter Reich, a professor of international affairs,
ethics and human behavior at George Washington University, is a
senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center. He was director of the
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum from 1995 to 1998.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days, everyone is writing Yasser Arafat's political obituary.
But the conversation generally stops short when the topic turns to
who--or what--could replace him.</LD>
<LD>   It's time to go back to the fundamental strategic problem facing
Israel and the Palestinians and to determine what, in the wake of
Arafat's failure as a peacemaker, could solve it. The answer may well
lie with Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   The great majority of Israelis want to withdraw from nearly all of
the West Bank and Gaza. The steady stream of suicide bombings in
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and elsewhere present Israel with the emotional
equivalent of a World Trade Center attack, one floor at a time, with
no end in sight.</LD>
<TE>   But even if the Israelis were to pull out of most of their
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza and build a high wall between
themselves and the Palestinians, it would solve nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Palestine Liberation Organization's
own military forces--heavily fortified by ever more offensive and
terrorist arms supplied by Iran, such as those on the ship Israel
recently captured--would pursue the Israelis while they retreated.
The Palestinians would fire Katyusha rockets nonstop over the wall
across the entire length of Israel's very narrow and highly populated
coastal plain, from Tel Aviv to Haifa, killing more Israelis every
day.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide bombers would get through or around the wall. In all
likelihood, suicide bombers from Israel's own million-strong
Palestinian community--20% of Israel's population--would take up any
slack that might result, if only temporarily, from the building of
such a wall. Israel would retaliate, temporarily reoccupy the West
Bank and Gaza, and replay the nightmare again and again.</TE>
<TE>   All this would happen because for most Palestinians--especially
the millions of descendants of the approximately 650,000 refugees who
fled or were expelled at the creation of Israel--the problem isn't
the West Bank and Gaza; it's the continued existence of Israel
itself.</TE>
<TE>   One of Arafat's greatest failings was that in the eight years
since signing the Oslo accords, he never educated his people to
accept the central principle of Oslo: that they had to give up the
idea that one day all of Israel would become part of the Palestinian
state.</TE>
<TE>   No other Palestinian leader would be any more able to succeed
where Arafat has failed. Even a leader willing to let the Israelis
withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza without killing them along the
way or afterward would not be able to stop the many factions that now
have absorbed into their existential and moral lexicon the necessity
of suicide-bombing, jihad and a bloody struggle to the end of time.</TE>
<TE>   But a Jordanian leader would succeed in this task very well.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's King Abdullah II has a strong and disciplined army easily
capable of controlling all of the Palestinian factions. Having once
incorporated the West Bank into Jordan itself, Jordan could
again--but this time temporarily--take it over, together with Gaza,
in a coordinated arrangement with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few years, it could protect Israel from the
Palestinians, protect the Palestinians from each other and fulfill a
deal with Israel for the creation of a peaceful Palestinian state
along lines that would be fair to Palestinians as well as Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The two sticking points that Arafat couldn't deal with--what to do
about Jerusalem and about the millions of refugee descendants--would
be much more easily dealt with, and dealt with honorably, by Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see what would be in this for Israel: the freedom to
withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza without being fired on during
the withdrawal and endlessly afterward, and the ability to make a
deal with a leader who would stick to, and be able to enforce, that
deal.</TE>
<TE>   It's also easy to see what would be in this for the Palestinians:
An outside power, but this time an Arab one, would control the chaos,
violence, retaliation and reoccupation that a simple Israeli
withdrawal would guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   But the sweetest deal would be for the Jordanians themselves. What
alarms Jordan's King Abdullah is an attempted takeover of his country
by the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   This alarm is so great--and in this period of leadership crisis so
acute--that just this week, King Abdullah issued a warning that "any
talk about Jordan serving as a substitute homeland for Palestine is
harmful to both Palestine and Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah's nightmare is that, unable to topple Israel, West Bank
Palestinians would try to enlarge their boundaries to the east with
the help of Jordan's own Palestinians, who make up about 70% of that
country's population.</TE>
<TE>   By exerting leadership now, King Abdullah can avert this. He can
make a deal with the Israelis that would enable them to safely move
out of nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza. With these territories
thus controlled and pacified, he could put in place military, social
and educational structures for a Palestinian state with borders
limited to the West Bank and Gaza. And he could then get out of the
West Bank and Gaza, leaving a Palestinian state that, instead of
expanding east or west, could seek to realize its destiny within its
own national space.</TE>

<HD>'Rumor of Angels' Remains Earthbound</HD>
<DH>The presence of Vanessa Redgrave can't compensate for the
overly sentimental tale of intergenerational friendship and grief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vanessa Redgrave does glorious the way other actresses do their
makeup. Routinely. Effortlessly. Organically. That Judi Dench has
been appointed the current grande dame of English acting has got to
be rooted in political default, because when Redgrave appears, all
pretenders are cast in shadow.</LD>
<LD>   But even she has trouble taking flight while having to drag along
the soggy ballast of "A Rumor of Angels," a tepid, cliche-ridden tale
of intergenerational friendship, grief and voices from the grave.
When the movie debuted almost two years ago--at festivals--it might
have still had some relevance to the angels-among-us craze, which as
we all know birthed certain television shows and several million
chronic delusions. (Director Peter O'Fallon is a director-producer of
TV's "Mysterious Ways," so he clearly has an affinity for this kind
of cloying thesis.) Theological matters aside, the movie is so
clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking
in tongues.</LD>
<LD>   The movie looks gorgeous, though, partly because of Roy H.
Wagner's cinematography and partly because it's set on a ruggedly
spectacular stretch of Maine coast where 12-year-old James (Trevor
Morgan of "The Patriot") is spending the summer. His mother, of
course, is dead.</LD>
<TE>   Why "of course"? Because that way he gets to hate his new
stepmother (Catherine McCormack), resent his father (Ray Liotta) for
spending so much time on business in Boston, hang out with his
pot-addled Uncle Charlie (Ron Livingston), and, eventually, bond with
the local recluse and eccentric, Maddy Bennett (Redgrave). Together,
Maddy and James will heal the wounds of their losses--James of his
mother, Maddy of her son who died in Vietnam and who apparently
communicates with her from the afterlife.</TE>
<TE>   Maddy, a Mozart freak, fisherwoman and all-around hardy
down-easter (even if she's English) spends little time being reticent
with James. It's not, in other words, as if he has to pull her out of
her shell. Far from it: He's an obnoxious, sullen kid (it may be
cruel to say, but the actor is about as irritating as a rat in your
shorts) whom Maddy decides is worthy of her considerable practical
knowledge, as well as her insight into the great unknown. Why? Well,
she is the local eccentric.</TE>
<TE>   What Liotta and McCormack are doing in this movie--never mind
Redgrave--may be something they'd want to explore on "Mysterious
Ways." The emotional aspects of the story are treated with such a
heavy hand, the supernatural aspects are so vague and uninvolving,
and the group dynamic is so unconvincing that one can't quite imagine
why anybody bothered.</TE>
<TE>   It's always a treat to watch Redgrave: She seems to be channeling
her old muse Isadora Duncan during one rather cringe-inducing dance
with James, performed while they paint her picket fence. But it's
never a treat watching actors who, for whatever reason, seem to be in
it only for the money.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for certain thematic elements, an accident
scene and brief references to drug use.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Super Bowl postgame analysis this year won't be confined to passing
and tackling but will cover promoting and selling as well.</LD>
<LD>   "Super Commercials, a Mental Engineering Special" will be
broadcast after the game on most PBS stations, including KCET-TV in
Los Angeles. The half-hour program, derived from "Mental
Engineering," a round-table panel show hosted and produced by John
Forde, seeks to deconstruct commercials, how they are supposed to
work psychologically and their cultural influence.</LD>
<LD>   Forde, based in St. Paul, Minn., originated the show on cable
access; he will be joined by a communications professor, a computer
scientist, "Talk Soup" host Aisha Tyler and comedian Lizz Winstead,
co-creator of "The Daily Show."</LD>
<TE>   Evaluating Super Bowl commercials has become an annual event, but
not quite in the way "Mental Engineering" approaches it. Beyond the
somewhat lofty goal of helping people decipher the messages that
bombard them and not "live through some contrived sense of corporate
identity," Forde sees the show as a means to bring viewers in their
20s and 30s to PBS and "create a new audience for public television."</TE>
<TE>   "Kids watch PBS until they're 6," he said, "and then they go away
until they're 50."</TE>

<HD>St.Clair Makes an Unusual Combination of Pieces Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carl St.Clair's latest program with the Pacific Symphony, first heard
Wednesday night in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center, comprised three oddly contrasting works.</LD>
<LD>   Mozart's Rococo bonbon, the delectable Rondo in D for piano and
orchestra, became the overture, followed strangely by Leonard
Bernstein's irritatingly self-absorbed and quirky Second Symphony,
subtitled "The Age of Anxiety." Then, to restore balance and
sobriety, the event's climax was Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   St.Clair made this combination work, and the orchestra played up
to what must be its highest standard. Clarity and single-mindedness
characterized all the performances, in particular the most exposed,
Beethoven's familiar signature piece. This re-creation unfolded
logically, all its elements tightly in place, its continuity
undisturbed. Each movement fulfilled its storytelling function
compellingly. All the force and power of the climaxes were exerted,
but without exaggeration; the conductor avoided overstatement, and
the entirety proved balanced and articulate. A gem.</LD>
<TE>   Some listeners--this one, for instance--once admired Bernstein's
"Age of Anxiety," a dramatic symphonic essay with a terrific piano
obbligato part approaching concerto status, and even went so far as
to call it a masterpiece. Time has changed our minds. It is a work
which aspires to Mahlerian profundity while producing Copland-esque
noodling. One can enjoy it without mistaking its flat-footedness.</TE>
<TE>   This performance, then, in which the American pianist Benjamin
Pasternack did all the right musical things convincingly, became a
mixed revival. St.Clair conducted with a controlled ferocity.
Pianist, conductor and orchestra treated Mozart with equal affection.</TE>

<HD>Pacifica Network Knows No Peace</HD>
<DH>The general manager of L.A. outlet KPFK-FM was ousted last
week, as programming and money problems escalate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In their family brawl over control of the left-leaning Pacifica radio
network, the combatants have finally crashed through the looking
glass, landing in a parallel world that reverses everything they knew
before.</LD>
<LD>   A week ago at the Los Angeles outlet of the five-station network,
KPFK-FM (90.7), general manager Mark Schubb was placed on
administrative leave and told not to return.</LD>
<LD>   He's calling it payback, saying he's the victim of a purge, while
the head of the local listeners' advisory board--a group constantly
at odds with Schubb--says Schubb was "actively engaged in misleading
the listeners" and refused to air certain programming.</LD>
<TE>   "They're clearly on a jihad to purge people not loyal to their
faction," Schubb said. "As far as I'm concerned, I'm an employee in
good standing."</TE>
<TE>   But Local Advisory Board chairman David Adelson said Schubb lied
to listeners about the causes of problems within the network and was
disdainful of input from the public via the advisory board.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an opening now for some real changes," Adelson
said, because a network-wide gag order has been lifted and listeners
can hear about the goings-on. Adelson was a plaintiff in one of three
lawsuits against Pacifica, alleging that those running the network
were squandering money and ignoring the needs of the listeners. Those
suits were settled in December, in an agreement that re-formed the
board of directors and put a dissident group in charge.</TE>
<TE>   The management change at KPFK is just the latest chapter in the
ongoing Pacifica saga. The tiny network, started by pacifists in
Berkeley after World War II, has been rocked by turmoil for more than
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Members of a dissident group of listeners said they were trying to
save Pacifica and return it to its original, progressive politics and
programming. They charged that those running the Pacifica Foundation
and its five radio stations--the executive director and the national
board of directors--were conspiring to turn it more mainstream,
discouraging criticism of their political allies.</TE>
<TE>   The popular general manager of the Berkeley station was removed in
1999, causing street protests and unrest that shuttered the station
for three weeks. At the end of 2000, the general manager at New York
station WBAI was fired and the station locks were changed in what was
dubbed the "Christmas coup."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous other longtime employees and volunteers were sent packing
at the five stations. And for the latter half of 2001, the network's
signature program, the newsmagazine "Democracy Now!" with host Amy
Goodman, was forced off the air in a personnel dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "At all levels of Pacifica, we need leadership that needs to move
past a history of conflict to a new period of healing and
rebuilding," said Dan Coughlin, acting executive director of the
Pacifica Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin and Pacifica board chairman Leslie Cagan tapped Steven
Starr, a longtime member of the Los Angeles Independent Media Center,
to be KPFK's interim general manager at the suggestion of the Local
Advisory Board.</TE>
<TE>   "He's known in a lot of media circles around Los Angeles," Adelson
said, noting that Starr got his start in radio in college and since
then has been involved in movies, television and Internet ventures.
"He's got a long-standing commitment to democratic media, and he's
got experience dealing with talent and egos."</TE>
<TE>   The elements at KPFK are familiar--a station's general manager
relieved of his duties, charges of cronyism, a Web site decrying the
perceived injustices of the network's governing board and a call for
a grass-roots protest involving phone calls, faxes and e-mails. But
this time the ones doing the firing were the former dissidents, and
those heading for the door are the people the protesters had charged
were destroying the network.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston general manager resigned and took a severance package
before the newly formed board met in New York in January. At that
meeting, the general manager of the New York station, WBAI, was fired
and replaced by the general manager who had been fired in the
"Christmas coup."</TE>
<TE>   The Washington, D.C., station's general manager was relieved at
the same time as Schubb. The management remained intact only at the
Berkeley station, which doesn't heed directives from Pacifica
headquarters in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   One of the deepest wounds at the network is left over from the
infighting between the previous bureaucracy and the dissidents: a
$4-million debt the new Pacifica board found itself with, including
outstanding bills for expensive lawyers, public relations agencies
and security guards.</TE>
<TE>   Schubb has said, even on the air, that Pacifica and KPFK wouldn't
be in their current financial trouble if not for the dissidents'
fight and lawsuits. Opponents countered that it was the previous
board's intractability and unwillingness to negotiate with the
dissidents that escalated the fight and ran up the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "He's trying to connect the abuses of the previous board to this
board," turn listeners against the new regime and persuade them that
their donations have been ripped off, Adelson said. "It was not a
matter of lawsuits; it was a matter of corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Pacifica hired an accounting team to review the books, to
determine where the money was spent and how many bills are still
outstanding. That audit may be complete by today, Coughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to have to make some tough choices," he said. "We're
going to have to make cuts and we're going to have to increase
revenue."</TE>
<TE>   Another complaint about Schubb was that he balked when the new
board ordered him to return "Democracy Now!" to the air. A critic of
Goodman, who is revered by many Pacifica listeners, Schubb reinstated
the live 6 a.m. broadcast but not its 9 a.m. replay. He criticized
what he called the board's unprecedented meddling in local
programming.</TE>
<TE>   But Adelson contends that previous boards have rejected local
programming that they didn't like and said that's why Schubb was
hired seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Adelson said Schubb was part of a concerted push by
Pacifica leaders to change programming at the stations so it would
generate more donations.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling was, Adelson said, that a bloc of similar shows aimed
at "limousine liberals" who will pledge to the station was preferable
to a lineup in which a reggae show followed a gay and lesbian affairs
show that followed a blues show that followed a klezmer show.</TE>
<TE>   Adelson contended that such a station would be more diverse and
give a voice to voiceless constituencies. Starr returned "Democracy
Now!" to its 9 a.m. slot earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, KPFK has been transmitting at a quarter of its power
for months, while a new transmitter sits in storage at the foot of
Mt. Wilson, waiting to be hauled up the mountain and activated. The
station raised about $800,000 in the last three years to replace
aging equipment, but that money disappeared after KPFK sent it to
Pacifica's financial office early in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin said the problems surrounding the KPFK transmitter should
be resolved in a couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the most successful fund drive in the history of our
station, and we can't pay the bills," Schubb said, referring to the
$533,000 the station raised in November. And, as a parting shot, he
had a dire warning about the future of the network that both sides
have fought so bitterly over for years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very concerned about the financial future. I think they're
facing bankruptcy," he said. "This is not a time to have amateurs
learning how to play public radio. They are very likely to lose it
all and be forced to sell a station to stay solvent."</TE>
<TE>   But Adelson said he hopes that with the new openness within
Pacifica and the promise that the listeners will have more input into
the network that they already feel is their own, the organization can
avoid the bitterness of previous disagreements that racked the
stations.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as we talk to the listeners about what's been going on, I
have a lot of hope," he said. "They're likely to be the greatest
moderating force in a lot of the conflicts."</TE>

<HD>'Malcolm' to Make a Play for Viewers After the Super Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN ELBER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think you know football? So who won the Super Bowl in 1996? 1998?
2001?</LD>
<LD>   The answers, in order, are "Friends," "3rd Rock From the Sun" and
"Survivor II: The Australian Outback"--series that received the
prized postgame spot and enviable audience spillover.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Super Bowl provides television's single biggest
predictable audience, playing piggyback with the game can mean extra
ratings yardage for a show.</LD>
<TE>   The debut episode of "Survivor II," for example, aired after last
year's Super Bowl and ended up scoring as the most popular
entertainment program of the 2000-01 season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one you don't want to waste. It's golden ammunition,"
said industry analyst Larry Gerbrandt of Kagan World Media.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, home of the Super Bowl on Sunday, has anointed as the game's
beneficiary "Malcolm in the Middle," the sitcom about a genius kid
(Frankie Muniz) and his endearingly loopy family.</TE>
<TE>   A one-hour episode--with a mud-wrestling match between series star
Jane Kaczmarek and Susan Sarandon among the highlights--will follow
the New England Patriots-St. Louis Rams game.</TE>
<TE>   How did Fox make the call?</TE>
<TE>   "With a great deal of difficulty," said network programming chief
Gail Berman.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors tipped the contest toward "Malcolm." The network
wanted to showcase a program that dovetailed with a Super Bowl
that--like many post-Sept. 11 events--will have a distinctly
patriotic tone. "We wanted to be supportive of that," Berman said.
"We wanted to make sure the whole Super Bowl experience was a
tremendous family experience. And one of our favorite family shows is
'Malcolm.'"</TE>
<TE>   Expectations for "Malcolm" go beyond a one-time ratings pump.
Expanding the "Malcolm" audience through Super Bowl exposure is the
goal of Fox and the sitcom's creator and executive producer, Linwood
Boomer.</TE>
<TE>   The comedy does well among the advertiser-favored young
demographic, but the numbers slip among older viewers. For the
prime-time season so far, it's No. 1 among teenagers (tied with "The
Simpsons"), but is ninth among viewers ages 18-34 and 16th among
those 18-49.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very large audience and very specific group of people,
which thankfully the advertisers like," Boomer said. "But the thing
I've tried to do with this show is get whole families watching. We
try very hard to make a show where there's something for the parents
to watch, the kids to watch, and hopefully we can broaden that even
more."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, nothing is sure in the TV game, especially for an
unproven player. For instance, NBC premiered "Homicide" after the
1993 Super Bowl. The gritty crime drama scored a healthy 31% share of
audience. After that, in its regular time slot, "Homicide" went on to
finish 99th for the season.</TE>
<TE>   This year, as befits its proximity to a sports extravaganza,
"Malcolm" is pulling out the stops. Besides Sarandon, other drop-in
celebrities include model Heidi Klum, basketball great Magic Johnson
and Bradley Whitford of "The West Wing" (Kaczmarek's real-life
husband).</TE>
<TE>   "Malcolm's" big play could end up fumbled, cautioned analyst
Gerbrandt. "The fear is it's a blowout game.... What you want is a
seesaw game, decided at the final second, so people hang around for
the show."</TE>

<HD>'Worldly Acts' Need No Camera</HD>
<DH>One-act plays envisioned as future film projects are so
good on stage it's hard to imagine them as movies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the advertising world, four out of five doctors is enough. And
four out of five plays that are fresh, startling and wickedly
well-crafted is enough to highly recommend "Worldly Acts," five
one-acts making their Los Angeles debut at the Tiffany Theater.</LD>
<LD>   The five works are presented by the New York theater company Urban
Empire in association with Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope: All
Story, a quarterly fiction magazine blunt about its intention to
channel short stories and plays into viable film projects. The
evening was first staged last June in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   The Zoetrope connection raises suspicion that "Worldly Acts" will
be the stage version of a Hollywood pitch meeting. Luckily, not. The
playwrights may not be happy to hear this if they envision a future
of Hollywood deal-making, but the most successful entries take such
deft advantage of the one-act structure that it's impossible to
imagine them existing as anything else.</LD>
<TE>   The best three are the most deliberately comic: "Boise, Idaho" by
Sean Michael Welch, "Daniel on a Thursday" by Garth Wingfield and
"Homecoming" by Joe Borini. Although the creations of three writers,
they share a comic style that marries an extremely heightened reality
with outrageously exaggerated plot twists. For lack of an existing
word, let's call it Zoetropian.</TE>
<TE>   "Boise, Idaho," an encounter between a stranger and a staid
Midwestern couple in a restaurant, not only breaks the fourth wall
between actors and audience, it also cheerfully smashes the
convention of the invisible wall between onstage narrator and the
characters in the drama. "Daniel on a Thursday," a tense encounter
between strangers at a gay bar, is equally effective in upending
expectations and features a particularly funny turn by Jack Merrill
as Kevin, playing an intricate mind game with startled bar patron
Daniel (Scott Paetty). And in "Homecoming," truth is so much stranger
than fiction that it almost triggers a nervous breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Beesley's "The Stolen Child" is the evening's only serious
entry. There's a brittle tension between Elliot (Mike Weaver) and
Ilisha (Lanette Ware) as an affluent couple earnestly seeking to
assuage upper-middle-class guilt by making a sojourn to Africa. A
more conventional effort than the comedies, but moving and elegantly
played.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Elizabeth Dewberry's "Who's on Top." How'd this one
sneak in? A self-absorbed young couple wax philosophical about
love--in a whiny sort of way--while they are opening their wedding
gifts. Along with multiple blenders (the functions of which--crush,
grind and liquefy--become painfully cute metaphors for lovemaking),
they receive a gift of family burial plots. The proposed eternal
positioning of the not-yet-deceased sparks a power struggle and
commitment fears that threaten to tear them apart. Problem is that
Courtney (Daniella Feenix) is so annoying and Michael (Ford Austin)
so spineless, you stop rooting for this match long before the act is
over. Better for these two to cut their losses, grab a blender and
make a run for it.</TE>

<HD>Carter Coaxes Diverse Tones From Array of  Saxophones</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think of James Carter as the Lon Chaney of jazz, able to slip in and
out of diverse musical disguises at a moment's notice. Or maybe as
the Jimi Hendrix of the saxophone, scouring the instrument's innards
to extract every imaginable kind of sound.</LD>
<LD>   And don't forget the fact that, like Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Carter
moves with ease and imagination from one saxophone to another,
constantly in search of each of their secrets.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday night at the Jazz Bakery, Carter--working with organist
Gerard Gibbs and drummer Leonard King--delivered a set of music
embracing every one of those reference points. He has always been a
masterful instrumentalist, working assiduously to develop a virtuosic
technical expertise. But he is now well beyond traditional
virtuosity, reaching into the generation of sounds that surely never
occurred to Adolphe Sax when he invented the family of instruments
that bears his name.</LD>
<TE>   There were passages in the program, especially during pieces such
as Joe Henderson's "Recorda Me," in which Carter played with a
surprisingly soft and tender sound, his improvisations filled with
subtle melodic paraphrases. At other times, he added an appealing,
burry edge to his tone--the result calling up images, on soprano
saxophone, of Sidney Bechet.</TE>
<TE>   But Carter didn't hesitate to get down and dirty too, closing with
a number enlivened by a honking, driving solo that would have been
appropriate for a bar-walking stint in a '50s rock 'n' roll club.</TE>
<TE>   And, perhaps most fascinating of all, he employed every imaginable
saxophone sound-producing technique: slap-tonguing, flutter-tonguing,
multi-phonics, high harmonics, circular breathing and more. Aside
from their value as music and entertainment, his saxophone excursions
offered an astounding seminar in the instrument's expressive
potential.</TE>
<TE>   Carter was supported well by Gibbs and King, who were quick to
respond to his sudden musical shifts, countering with impressive
soloing of their own. A moderate-sized but youthful (for the Bakery)
audience reacted enthusiastically to every nuance of the set,
climaxing by offering the Carter trio a well-earned standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The James Carter Trio at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver

<HD>Krist Novoselic's Band Shows Jagged Edges, Promising Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early in his new band's set at the Troubadour Wednesday, former
Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic jokingly referred to the trio as a
"support group." Call it "Guys Whose Old Bands Were Ripped Apart by
Drug-Related Tragedies Anonymous."</LD>
<LD>   Taking the name Eyes Adrift, the group teams Novoselic with former
Meat Puppets singer-guitarist Curt Kirkwood and ex-Sublime drummer
Bud Gaugh, each a survivor of that horror. Novoselic lived through
the suicide of Kurt Cobain, Gaugh the overdose death of Sublime
leader Bradley Nowell and Kirkwood the debilitating addiction of his
brother and Meat Puppets bassist Cris Kirkwood.</LD>
<LD>   The bond of that common experience was manifest Wednesday in the
threesome's spirited camaraderie. With Novoselic's Nirvana mate Dave
Grohl among the curious onlookers, the band leaned mostly to the
psychedelic-country-jam-punk aesthetic of the Meat Puppets (Kirkwood
is the primary singer and songwriter), and it did indeed occasionally
seem adrift. But the three began playing together only two months
ago, with just a handful of live performances under their belts.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes the raggedness seemed right, especially in songs
suggesting Neil Young and Grateful Dead influences. Other times it
was just ragged, with the writing not fully honed and the musical
interplay not fully gelled.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkwood remains a stunning guitarist, Gaugh (now of the Long
Beach Dub All-Stars) a skilled and imaginative drummer and Novoselic
a rock-solid bassist. So the building blocks are certainly there, and
a closing jam hinted at tremendous possibilities, with alt-rock
echoes of the Who, Pink Floyd and the Doors. It would be a big help
if either Kirkwood or Novoselic were a better singer, though at times
there was a charm to their not-quite-on-key vocals, too.</TE>

<LD>Brazilian Carnaval arrives in the Southland in unusually authentic
fashion next weekend. On Feb. 9 at the Hollywood Palladium, Brazilian
Carnaval 2002 is bringing members of one of Rio's major Carnaval
ensembles--the Imperatriz Leopoldinense Samba School--to Los Angeles
for a rare firsthand opportunity to sample some of the colorful
costumes and intensely rhythmic music of the escolas de samba that
parade through Rio the following day as part of the city's famous
Carnaval parade and competition.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very excited about having this particular samba school
here," says Patricia Leao, who produces Brazilian Carnaval 2002
through her Brazilian Nites production company. "They are one of the
most famous and one of the most successful groups in Rio. The
Leopoldinense group that performs at Carnaval has 3,000 members and
they have been the winner of the Rio competition for the last three
consecutive years. They like to say they're the first winners of the
21st century--which, of course, they are."</LD>
<TE>   The Imperatriz Leopoldinense Samba School has a lengthy Carnaval
history. Organized in 1959, the group succeeded the Carnaval Bloco
Recreio de Ramos, an ensemble whose membership included such
illustrious Brazilian musical figures as Pixinguinha and Heitor Villa
Lobos. Leopoldinense (which is named after a district in Rio) has
captured a total of eight Carnaval championships and pioneered the
practice of seeking Carnaval themes from Brazilian art and
literature.</TE>
<TE>   The Leopoldinense that performs at Carnaval 2002 will consist of a
relatively small contingent of 12 performers. But Leao describes them
as a nucleus of the school's finest drummers and dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see a very tight group, definitely from the first
level," she says. "And remember, only the finest performers can even
get into a school that is this famous. Rio has over 12 million people
and the auditions are very difficult. Everything the schools do has
to be precise, in so many ways--the costumes, the floats, the song.
And to get 3,000 people to do that accurately is amazing. The
batteria, for example, which consists of about 500 percussionists,
have to turn into a kind of angle and stay on the side while
everything passes by. They're amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Of course an ensemble of 12 artists isn't quite the same as the
massive effect of the Leopoldinense singers, dancers and drummers in
full regalia. Instead, Leao will offer a kind of mini-version of the
larger presentation.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be the climax of the night," she says. "Around midnight
we'll have a costume contest, and just after that, Imperatriz
Leopoldinense will come in. They'll parade across the dance floor,
hopefully with people following them, and culminate up on stage. Then
they'll perform until 2 a.m. I asked if they'd have any trouble
playing for two straight hours of batucada drumming, and they just
laughed. 'We play from morning to night when we're getting ready for
Carnaval,' they said, 'so it's no problem at all.'"</TE>
<TE>   She also will include a practice common to Carnaval in Rio, in
which samba schools pass out copies of the lyrics to their song while
they're parading so that the audience can sing, too.</TE>
<TE>   "Since there won't be just Brazilians at our show, many people
might not speak the language, but they can still sing along, and
we'll encourage them to do so, to get into the fun of the whole
experience."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Imperatriz Leopoldinense Samba School,
Brazilian Carnaval 2002 will feature a guest-star appearance by
singer-dancer Katia Moraes. She will perform with Badaue, a
seven-piece ensemble that specializes in Bahian dance music as well
as other Latin and Caribbean styles such as cumbia, soca and salsa.
The 20 members of the TropiDANZA Dancers, led by
director-choreographer Leila Flores, will appear throughout the
evening dancing the samba as well as the lambada, frevo and capoeira.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do," says Leao, a native of Bolivia married
to a Brazilian, "is to create a carnival event that is very
authentic, that is close to what one might experience in Brazil. And
it's interesting, because after last year's program, I had a number
of Brazilian people tell me that in many respects, we are paralleling
what is happening in Rio."</TE>

<HD>'Time of Favor' Reveals the Inner State of a Nation</HD>
<DH>Israel's official Oscar entry is a vivid look at a divided
society in a West Bank settlement led by a charismatic rabbi.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES FILM CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Time of Favor" is one of the most successful, provocative and
intensely contemporary of Israeli films, so much so that to watch it
is to feel the country having a passionate argument with itself.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's entry for best foreign language Oscar and the winner of
six Israeli Academy Awards, including best picture, best screenplay,
best actor and best actress, "Time of Favor" is the impressive debut
of 33-year-old writer-director Joseph Cedar. A former infantry
paratrooper, he is one of the few Israeli directors to come out of
the Orthodox religious community, and that dual background is one of
the things that gives his work a distinctive quality.</LD>
<LD>   Part political thriller, part romantic melodrama, "Time of Favor"
is set in an Orthodox settlement on the West Bank led by a
charismatic rabbi. It looks candidly at the differing currents within
this community, at the personal price that is invariably paid for
messianic dreams, at how the philosophy of the settlements affects
individuals and the country as a whole. And it does so, despite the
theatricality endemic to Israeli films, with an even-handedness that
extends to points of view the film in no way supports.</LD>
<TE>   Although it's no more than glimpsed, the center of "Time of
Favor," much talked about but hardly ever on-screen, is Jerusalem's
Temple Mount, the site of places sacred to two religions--Islam's
Dome of the Rock and Judaism 's Western Wall. A visit here in
September 2000 by political candidate Ariel Sharon led inevitably to
violence and controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Also focused on the mount is the magnetic Rabbi Meltzer (Assi
Dayan, son of former Defense Minister Moshe Dayan and a major figure
in Israeli film). The rabbi dreams, as did his father before him, of
a new temple rising on the mount, and he conveys that dream to the
young men who study in his yeshiva.</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily a hard-core fanatic, the rabbi is sane, brilliant,
articulate, which makes secular Israelis view him as even more
dangerous than the zealots of the past, proof that, as one of them
nicely puts it, "the line between abnormal and normal has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Menachem (Israeli heartthrob Aki Avni) is one of the rabbi's
students and an officer in the army. As the film opens, Menachem is
given command of an entirely orthodox company that includes his best
friends Pini (Edan Alterman) and Itamar (Micha Selektar). It's a good
moment for Pini too. The most brilliant mind in the yeshiva, he has
been selected by the rabbi as a potential husband for his daughter
Michal. Michal, however, is more interested in Menachem, and, it
becomes increasingly obvious, he's interested in her as well.</TE>
<TE>   As played by Israeli actress Tinkerbell and written by Cedar (who
at one time wanted Natalie Portman for the role), Michal is the
film's most involving character. Unapologetically direct, she speaks
her mind about her situation at every opportunity, instigates and
quashes romantic situations, and provides an eloquent counterpoint to
her father's heedless advocacy and the film's welter of traditional
male voices.</TE>
<TE>   There is more going on in "Time of Favor" than boy meets girl.
There is also, in an echo of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a
Jewish religious student, the possibility of a plan to blow up the
Dome of the Rock that would be catastrophic for any chance of peace
in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Cedar--American-born, in Israel since he was 6 and holder of a
film degree from New York University--provides glimpses of many sides
of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   We see violent secret-police interrogation techniques that Human
Rights Watch would not approve of, as well as an enormously touching
scene of two Orthodox young people, fearful of physical contact,
courting by having their hands intertwine as shadows on a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Capturing Undercurrents of Divergent Philosophies</TE>
<TE>   Cedar's script also allows for divergent philosophical viewpoints
not often given screen time. We hear Rabbi Meltzer's genuine yearning
for Jerusalem, an orthodox man's explanation of how and why doing
everything for God is his ultimate goal, even the voice of a
fanatical terrorist talking about the "privilege" of being able to
"put history on its correct course."</TE>
<TE>   What Israelis no doubt take for granted turns out to be one of
"Time of Favor's" most interesting aspects for foreign audiences, and
that is a glimpse into how gruff and abrasive their society can be,
how lacking--as parties throughout the Middle East are--in the
ability to simply trust in people who don't share your point of view.
In this kind of a world, a happy ending is not likely. The only
question is exactly how distraught everyone is going to be.</TE>

<HD>Adolescent Humor Goes to College in 'Slackers'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Slackers," not to be confused with Richard Linklater's innovative
1991 "Slacker," is a standard issue undergrad gross-out comedy
notable only for the showy role it provides Jason Schwartzman,
well-remembered as "Rushmore's" geeky high school student Max
Fischer. Schwartzman, a short, stocky Energizer bunny, is the
irrepressible Ethan, who's smart yet hopelessly square, relentlessly
obnoxious but fearlessly persistent.</LD>
<LD>   When he catches the film's title characters--Devon Sawa's Dave,
Jason Segel's Sam and Michael C. Maronna's Jeff, all seniors nearing
graduation--cheating, he blackmails them into promising to land him
the girl of his dreams, the beautiful and cool Angela (James King).
This is gratifying at first because Dave, Sam and Jeff have cheated
their way through college, at times expending more energy in an
effort to avoid studying than it would take to actually learn
something. The smooth Dave is the natural choice to go after Angela
on Ethan's behalf, but he doesn't count on falling in love with her
in the process and thereby gaining some perspective.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Dave and his pals are so sleazy and shallow and
take up so much screen time that "Slackers" is a turnoff despite
Schwartzman's considerable efforts to garner laughs and sustain
attention. Post Sept. 11, it's hard to pay attention to the antics of
a trio of chiselers who've thrown away the opportunity for a college
education, and Sawa, Segel and Maronna have not been able to
transcend David H. Steinberg's smart-alecky script and Dewey Nicks'
crass direction.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron Diaz, Leigh Taylor-Young and Mamie Van Doren turn up in
cameos. The last of the '50s' blond bombshells, Van Doren, who always
seemed to take herself less seriously than Marilyn or Jayne, has an
outrageous scene that quite possibly only she could get away with--or
even attempt at her age.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong language and sexual content, and for
brief drug use. Times guidelines: The raunch factor is pretty high.</TE>

<HD>Michael Smuin Takes  a Spin With the Greats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Choreographer Michael Smuin is fearless, and half the fun of his
"Dancin' With Gershwin," Wednesday at the Alex Theatre in Glendale,
came from watching him tackle songs associated with a pantheon of
high-profile dance-makers, from Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and George
Balanchine to Tommy Tune and Susan Stroman.</LD>
<LD>   Danced by his attractive, skillful Smuin Ballets/SF, his plotless
full-evening medley proved strong in its theatrical concepts but weak
in choreographic development, with even the cleverest staging ploys
quickly losing their luster because he couldn't sustain them with
original movement. Repetition set in, and even Easton Smith's
spectacular overhead lifts eventually grew over-familiar.</LD>
<LD>   But Smuin had a couple of not-so-secret weapons that kept the
evening aloft, starting with Willa Kim's bold and witty costumes.
And, all by themselves, the varied recordings used as accompaniment
offered an 80-year recap of some fabulous Gershwin performances.</LD>
<TE>   Besides Smith's lifts, the evening depended heavily on the mature
lyricism of Celia Fushille-Burke, the gymnastic daring of Sarah
Barber and the energetic tapping of Shannon Hurlburt--though he
looked much more impressive in ballet bravura during the finale and a
rock solo early on. Allison Jay also made an impact as a Marilyn
Monroe clone and in a dreamy love duet with Barber.</TE>
<TE>   The evening began with a lot of surprises, among them two
intermissions in the first 40 minutes. The first interval came after
the company performed Smuin's sextet "Star Shadows" (to Ravel) and
two solos from "To the Beatles Revisited" as an unannounced
curtain-raiser; the second took place when an accidental snag left a
"Gershwin" piano prop dangling precariously over the dancers' heads.</TE>

<HD>Town Hopes Believers Will Follow 'Mothman'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD McELHINNY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>POINT PLEASANT, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>Moviegoers who have seen the new psychic thriller "The Mothman
Prophecies" can now order the Mothman Pizza.</LD>
<LD>   They can munch on the cherry tomato eyes, the green pepper feet
and mushroom wings while reading a new book on the legend during a
visit to the West Virginia town where it all began.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, with the film, starring Richard Gere and Laura Linney,
making a strong early box office showing, townspeople are hoping for
a tourist rush to this hamlet of 5,000 about 40 miles northwest of
Charleston, the state capital.</LD>
<TE>   "Dozens of people have already been here," said Donnie Sergent, a
local music store owner who is marketing his own book "Mothman: The
Facts Behind the Legend" for $18.95, plus a companion CD-ROM on his
own Web site at www.mothmanlives.com.  The site, similar to the
movie's official Web site at www.themothmanlives.com, features a home
page beckoning browsers to "Enter Mothman Territory ... if you dare."</TE>
<TE>   At Village Pizza, the Mothman special is basically whatever kind
of pie you want.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll put the wings and eyes on," said Susie Woodall, the pizza
chef in charge of the monstrous creation. "It's pretty good. You've
got to like mushrooms and green peppers."</TE>
<TE>   The film tells the story of a Washington Post reporter played by
Gere, who is inexplicably drawn hundreds of miles out of his way to
Point Pleasant, a dying town on the Ohio River, where he encounters a
creature with moth-like wings whose appearance is the precursor of
death and disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The town owes its prominence in the film to a series of reported
sightings that began in 1966 among people who believed they saw
anything from a "giant butterfly" to a "brown human being" flying out
of the trees. Legend holds that the sightings were a harbinger of
disaster that occurred a year later when the town's Silver Bridge
collapsed, killing 46 people.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics in Point Pleasant contend that the sightings were nothing
more than a sandhill crane.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, even skeptics can be found hawking something
based on the legend.</TE>
<TE>   Austin herself is selling little gray Mothman dolls with red eyes
and wings, and Mothman tree ornaments from her office and her Web
site, at www.moth-man.com.</TE>
<TE>   Rush Finley, owner of the Lowe Motor Inn, wants even more people
to come to town. He suggests turning an empty storefront across from
his hotel into a Mothman museum. He also doesn't mind if those who
visit town are a little odd. "We're redneck enough to handle any kind
of people that come," Finley says.</TE>

grown up around the vinyl record since the coming of the digital age.
With the restless vitality of a deejay, the obsessive erudition of a
record collector and the detached curiosity of a chemist, Robleto
does just about everything one can do to records without playing
them: He shreds them, slices them, melts them, molds them and
fossilizes them, all in the service of an obscure and vaguely
Victorian system of alchemy.</LD>
<LD>   The largest piece in the show is "The Diva Surgery," a glass-case
laboratory crowded with a macabre assortment of containers and
instruments (a lab burner, a glass breast pump, a tracheal extractor
and "vintage surgical equipment," to name a few). It features a
downright bizarre collection of materials, including not only vinyl
and audio tape, but sulfur, carbon, amino acids, crushed cubic
zirconium, Novocain, sugar, honey, ocean water, oil, hummingbird and
butterfly nectar, beeswax and polyester resin.</LD>
<TE>   Robleto blends these substances in sterile jars and beakers to
form compounds such as "Low End Boom," "Honey Vocals," "Vocal
Dissolution" and "Sing Me to Sleep Mix," which presumably stimulate
reactions with the saffron-like threads of shredded vinyl--distilled
diva-ness--that wait in dozens of tiny glass vials with labels such
as "Peggy," "Bessy," "Patsy," "Shirley," "Ella" and "Edith." This
chemist, in other words, is a disc jockey.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining works are less elaborate but equally clever. In
"Dusty in Stasis (Dusty Come Back)," Robleto preserves fragments of a
Dusty Springfield record in what is apparently hand-ground
prehistoric amber. In "Falsetto Can Be a Weapon," he transfigures
records into tools of defense and destruction: The Carpenters'
"Hurting Each Other" becomes an arrow, Tammy Wynette's "Stand by Your
Man" a spear, and Roberta Flack's "Killing Me Softly With His Song" a
tomahawk.</TE>
<TE>   A series of paper collages called "Chemistry in the Church"
extends the scientific motif into the realm of Christian music to
produce covers for fictional albums such as "Organ Favorites of the
Lutheran Lunacy," "Holy Roman Inquiry on Nanotechnology" and "Vicars
for the De-Romanticization of Astronomy."</TE>
<TE>   The only material that this intelligent, conceptually thorough
exhibition lacks, it seems, is sound. Or does it? Its meticulously
labeled artifacts conjure voices in the memory, generating a lively
internal soundtrack. One can't help but wonder how much of this music
emanates from the vinyl itself.</TE>

<TE>   An Intimate Trip to Dreamland</TE>
<TE>   Callum Morton's "The Big Sleep: A Bad Dream and a Wet Dream," the
centerpiece of his exhibition at Karyn Lovegrove Gallery, consists of
two small twin beds installed about 6 feet above the floor on
opposite walls of the gallery, like bunks in a dormitory. Sheets and
thick wool blankets conceal a lump on each bed about the size of a
preadolescent boy.</TE>
<TE>   It's a convincing enough arrangement to make one stop and watch
for movement beneath the blankets. Instead of tossing and turning,
however, the invisible bodies produce sound: a short symphony of
strained, uncomfortable groans every minute or two. As the work's
title indicates, one set of groans springs from fear and the other
from rapture, but they're indistinguishable to the listener.</TE>
<TE>   Like Morton's earlier architectural installations, which
re-created the exterior walls of other buildings inside the space of
a gallery, "The Big Sleep" establishes a compelling interplay of
presence and absence, interior and exterior, proximity and distance.
It draws viewers into the intimate, voyeuristic space of a bedroom
only to exclude them from the boys' noisy interior worlds, leaving
one with an unpleasant blend of guilt (for intruding) and
disappointment (for not having seen more).</TE>
<TE>   Also on view are digital prints from the series "Local and/or
General," a collaboration with a group called UDL, which includes
Morton, Nick Hubicki and Sean Elstob. Each of these flat, colorful
images depicts an iconic modernist home transformed into a familiar
retail franchise, such as Home Depot and 7-Eleven.</TE>
<TE>   Although commendably succinct, both bodies of work suffer from a
nagging sense of conceptual frugality. The central idea upon which
each hinges, while clever, fails to lead the viewer very far beyond
an initial nod or chuckle, and the spare visual style fails to pick
up the slack. In an effort to keep the work fashionably svelte, it
seems Morton has drained it of any potentially messy
significance--which is somewhat ironic, considering the subject of
"The Big Sleep." There is certainly no shortage of colorful material
surging through the minds of his hidden protagonists; one wishes he
had followed them a little further into it.</TE>

<TE>   Sweet Nostalgia Projected Onto Metal</TE>
<TE>   Almond Zigmund's recent photographs at Susanne Vielmetter Los
Angeles Projects--colorful, abstract compositions--feel like a summer
ride along the coast in a vintage convertible. You're back in high
school riding with a college boy (or girl) you met over milkshakes at
a snack bar, and for a moment everything in the world feels perfect.
The air is sweet, the sky is clear, the sun is warm and you're
radiant.</TE>
<TE>   The colors are pure nostalgic pleasure: sherbet orange, lemon
yellow, lavender, sea green, coral, teal. They cut distinct,
monochromatic swaths across the gracefully balanced compositions,
like flattened elements of a landscape or unidentifiable details of a
customized car. Occasional patches of upholstery-like floral patterns
enliven the balance and lend the work a retro spin.</TE>
<TE>   Digital images printed on aluminum, the works are not recognizably
photographic, but seem rather like airbrushed paintings. The tones
have a sweet, shallow, plastic quality that encourages a beach party
vibe but is, on closer inspection, significantly more delicate than
your standard issue surfboard.</TE>
<TE>   Also on view are several discreet, vinyl-covered wall sculptures:
slender, three-limbed forms that cling to the corners of the room
like a very pretty species of mold. Like the photographs, these works
flirt with a nostalgic and relatively banal aesthetic--they call to
mind the rec rooms of a 1970s-era childhood--but ultimately infuse it
with a contemporary complexity.</TE>

<LD>In the broad landscape of television programming, cable's TV Land
channel occupies a modest parcel where nostalgia is king and
surprises are few. But viewers tuning in at 9 tonight expecting yet
another trip to Mayberry or perhaps a visit with the Petries of New
Rochelle will be charting a course of a different color.</LD>
<LD>   To mark the arrival of Black History Month (February), TV Land
begins airing a three-part original special that is as unexpectedly
ambitious as it is engrossing: "African Americans in Television."</LD>
<LD>   Created for the channel by Gay Rosenthal Productions and narrated
by Ron Glass ("Barney Miller"), the briskly paced show is divided
into hourlong segments chronicling the struggle of blacks to gain a
foothold in variety programming (tonight), drama (Feb. 15 at 9 p.m.),
and comedy (Feb. 22 at 9 p.m.).</LD>
<TE>   There will be repeats of all three episodes at various times
throughout the month, and they'll be shown consecutively on March 1,
from 9 p.m. to midnight.</TE>
<TE>   The assemblage of talent in the scores of TV clips rolling across
the screen would have been entertaining enough, but the special has
added depth because the snippets are given historical and cultural
context via insightful interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "When 'The Nat "King" Cole Show' came on [in 1956], black families
across this nation found their way to whoever had the television set
in the neighborhood and watched, because everybody took pride in
that," NAACP President Kweisi Mfume recalls in tonight's episode.</TE>
<TE>   Actor D.L. Hughley put the experience of watching early black
shows more simply: "It was the only time we got to see us."</TE>
<TE>   The key roles that white performers such as Eddie Cantor and Steve
Allen, or producers such as Norman Lear, played in helping blacks
break through TV's formidable color barrier in the 1950s, '60s and
'70s is a recurring theme. So is the white-hot pressure some areas of
the country put on networks and advertisers to restore that barrier.
Yet sometimes, talent just won out.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody sings and dances better than we do, I'm sorry," says
actress Debbie Allen.</TE>
<TE>   In each of the three segments of "African Americans in
Television," there are shows that are set apart as pivotal moments of
an era, whose impact still resonates.</TE>
<TE>   In variety, Nat Cole's pioneering efforts and Flip Wilson's
groundbreaking hour receive special mention, as does the all-around
brilliance of Sammy Davis Jr.</TE>
<TE>   In the comedy segment, Bill Cosby's landmark sitcom, "The Cosby
Show," Redd Foxx ("Sanford and Son") and Diahann Carroll ("Julia")
are prominent, as well as Lear shows such as "All in the Family,"
"The Jeffersons" and "Good Times."</TE>
<TE>   Cosby's influence crosses genres into the drama segment for his
mixed-doubles starring role in 1965's "I Spy." (Says Cosby of being
the first black star in a TV drama: "I never worried about being the
first black, or the first Negro, or the first colored, because I was
too worried if I could act.") Cicely Tyson's standout performance in
"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman" (1974) was another
high-water mark.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was "Roots," the 12-hour television touchstone that
made ratings history in 1977 en route to a record 37 Emmy
nominations.</TE>
<TE>   "'Roots' helped supply America with a truer definition of who
black people were than any other work that had come around," says
actor Ossie Davis.</TE>
<TE>   It's a definition that's still evolving, and this three-part
special provides another valuable tool toward a deeper understanding.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first installment of "African Americans in Television" can be
seen at 9 tonight on TV Land.</TE>

<HD>'Voices': Strong Acting, Arcane Script</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playing five characters who linger at the table after a lavish dinner
party, Dutch actor Jeroen Willems displays impressive chameleonic
abilities in "Voices" at Macgowan Hall's Little Theater at UCLA. But
the script itself falls flat.</LD>
<LD>   The bulk of the text was assembled from the writings of the
Italian filmmaker and writer Pier Paolo Pasolini. His words were
placed in the mouths of a diffident and irony-besotted intellectual,
a hulking Italian manager and his subservient sidekick, and a vampish
woman who transforms into the devil. At the end, excerpts from
speeches and articles by a Shell International chairman, Cor
Herkstroter, were compiled into post-prandial remarks by a captain of
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The parts are supposed to add up to a critique of capitalism,
according to the publicity materials and some European reviews. But
at UCLA, the text seems excessively detached and arcane, especially
in contrast with some of the real-life stories in the news that might
also be seen as critiques of capitalism, for example the Enron Corp.
saga.</LD>
<TE>   Lacking any tangible evidence of suffering victims, concentrating
only on the supposed power centers of society, "Voices" is far too
oblique to serve as devastating commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Strictly as a performer, Willems generates interest. His hesitant
intellectual is worlds away from his drag act as the vamp, in which
he climbs atop the table and performs stunts with his tongue and
later with his woman's wig.</TE>
<TE>   More subtly, his Italian capitalist has a brutish style that's
missing from his later multinational capitalist, whose cool
inflections sound well-schooled by corporate handlers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, director Johan Simons' languid pacing, the meandering text
and the solo format itself--which allows little opportunity for
pointed exchanges between characters--give "Voices" a muffled
quality.</TE>
<TE>   It's a production of the Dutch company Zuidelijk Toneel Hollandia
and is, along with "Room," one of the opening presentations in UCLA
Live's Solo Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "Voices," UCLA's Little Theater, Macgowan Hall, northeast corner
of the campus, near Sunset Boulevard and Hilgard Avenue, Westwood.
Today through Sunday, 8:30 p.m. $35. (310) 825-2101. Running time: 1

<DL></DL>
<LD>"A Night in November" is one to remember, thanks to a superb
multi-character performance by Marty Maguire and a razor-sharp script
by Marie Jones.</LD>
<LD>   The same qualities that brought such sparkle to Jones' hit "Stones
in His Pockets"--her skillful rendering of the colorful speech of the
Irish and the telling everyday details that illuminate their
lives--are equally evident in this lesser-known piece, which makes
its L.A. debut at the Celtic Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   Both shows feature performers in multiple roles. But where
"Stones" employed two actors to weave the intricate interlocking
stories of an entire local population, "A Night in November" is
centrally focused on one character: Kenneth McCallister, a Northern
Irish Protestant and petty welfare office bureaucrat.</LD>
<TE>   All his life, Kenneth has remained dutifully obedient to his
cultural heritage. He even thinks of himself as English, having no
affinity with--much less compassion for--the needy Irish Catholics
who appear before him seeking government assistance.</TE>
<TE>   All that changes during a local soccer match against a team from
the southern Irish Republic. Kenneth is revolted by the abusive
behavior of his compatriots. Recognizing the bigotry around and
inside him sets Kenneth on an odyssey of self-discovery that
undermines the foundations of his unexamined existence. An especially
poignant insight comes when Kenneth offers a ride home to the
Catholic boss he's always despised, only to find himself envying the
spontaneous disorder of the other's home life.</TE>
<TE>   Like a male version of "Shirley Valentine," Kenneth finds his
dissatisfaction opens him to the possibility of authentic personal
fulfillment--and Maguire's portrayal of this transformation is never
short of riveting. In Tim Byron Owen's deft, no-frills staging,
switching between characters--sometimes in mid-sentence--is seamless
and thoroughly believable. Some consideration should be given to
running time, however--a needlessly extended intermission and some
redundancy in the text push the boundaries for a solo performance, no
matter how accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the narrative arc of this extraordinary piece is
more dramatically satisfying than the flashier "Stones" and carries
deeper universal resonance. Kenneth's hilarious breakout act of
self-definition--coinciding with the sadly partial moment of national
unity in Ireland's 1994 World Cup victory--is a moving testament to
the hopes and heartbreaks facing divided peoples everywhere.</TE>

<TE>   Tori Spelling Has the Range for 'Maybe Baby'</TE>
<TE>   Let's go straight to the big question: Yes, Tori Spelling belongs
on a stage. She brings solid comic instinct, a nice flair for
characterization and a lot of exuberance to her limited
engagement--and professional stage debut--in the sketch comedy show
"Maybe Baby, It's You," at the Coronet Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   If the "Beverly Hills, 90210" alumna doesn't yet match the
flexibility of Charlie Shanian in this two-person waltz through
relationships, it's due, at least in part, to his having had more
time to achieve it. He co-created the show and has been performing it
for months off-Broadway, on tour and in Los Angeles. Spelling
replaces co-creator Shari Simpson, who has returned home to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Baby" will never be accused of profundity, yet as it
navigates the landmines of dating in its first half, the sinkholes of
commitment in its second, it prompts laughs of recognition.</TE>
<TE>   In one memorable sketch, Spelling portrays Medea on a blind date
with a super-sensitive modern man. "Oh, what misery," the famously
wronged woman wails offstage as she prepares to reenter the dating
scene. Still declaiming to the skies, like Sarah Bernhardt on
steroids, she swaggers in, ready to take on the world. Will Shanian's
patient, polite guy--who quotes relationship advice he's heard on
"Oprah"--prove to be any match for her?</TE>
<TE>   Later, Spelling gets to show more range as a wife who turns an
anniversary dinner into a test of her husband's love. The woman wants
a passionate, public avowal of feeling, and when her hubby doesn't
deliver, her eyes turn glassy with hurt. Making a last-ditch effort,
she launches into song. Comically off-pitch but touchingly
expressive, she personifies love's dizzy derangement.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl H. Miller</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Baby, It's You," Upstairs at the Coronet, 368 N. La Cienega

Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   'WASP' a Funny, Dark Exploration of Family</TE>
<TE>   An absurdist plunge into family dysfunction, 1950s-style, Steve
Martin's "WASP" at the Sidewalk Studio Theatre plays a bit like an
episode of "Leave It to Beaver" filmed in an alternate universe. The
familiar period archetypes are all present and accounted for. There's
Dad (David Jay Barry), a pipe-smoking, cardigan-clad sage; Mom (Sally
Monroe), perky in hose and pearls; Sis (Staci Lawrence), gushy and
nubile; and Son (Scott Vinci), clean-cut and curious.</TE>
<TE>   But this Mom is a fragile basket case who chats with an omniscient
Female Voice (Sue Ulu), while Son gets regular visits from a space
alien (John Schaffer). Family interactions are skewed, to say the
least. As she goes dashing out the door, Sis blithely states, "I'm
off to choir molestation." And when Son muses about his future, Dad
"reassures" him, "No matter what in life you choose to do, I will be
there to shame you."</TE>
<TE>   Deft and incongruous, the play yields plenty of laughter but has a
serious point to make about the dark side of the American family. If
the characters chatter circuitously, that's fitting, given their
wrenching emotional disconnection. Isolated occupants of this family
Babel, they speak no common language, share no psychic connection.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointingly, Martin's quicksilver material often exceeds the
grasp of Kris Edlund's staging. Edlund has stylistic flair and a feel
for the period, but she doesn't always nail down the laughs hidden in
this tricky dialogue. Ulu and Schaffer, in particular, fail to muster
the comedic agility required in their vital lesser roles.</TE>

<HD>Lives Left to Marinate in 'American Adobo'</HD>
<DH>Filipino American friends gather around the table to await
a heaping serving of what comes next.</DH>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The infectious "American Adobo" takes its title from the Philippines'
national dish, which may be any meat or vegetable marinated in
vinegar, soy sauce and garlic. As prepared by Filipino Americans, it
acquires other flavors and ingredients, just as the immigrants may
find their lives taking on new directions and meanings over their
years in the U.S. while still feeling connected to their roots in
their native land. It's a feeling that is at once a source of
strength and conflict.</LD>
<LD>   This sense of dual identity is also a source of humor for director
Laurice Guillen and writer Vincent R. Nebrida. They never lose that
sense of humor even as they embrace some wrenchingly painful moments
in the lives of four friends who met as college classmates in the
Philippines, now live in New York and still stay in close touch 20
years later. The arrival of one college pal, Lorna (Sol Ocoa), for a
visit is the occasion for a celebration, and Tere (Cherry Pie
Picache) has prepared one of her typically outstanding meals in her
inviting Queens apartment, on a street lined with trees and gracious
vintage townhouses.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone in the group is doing reasonably well professionally,
living in tasteful quarters, but of course appearances are deceiving.
Tere is a beautiful woman, ample in the Kate Winslet manner, yet
despite her warm, loving nature and unfailing kindness, she has yet
to attract a man worthy of her. The brittle and glamorous Marissa
(Dina Bonnevie) has a successful career yet is more vulnerable than
she would like to be in regard to her live-in boyfriend, Sam (Randy
Becker), a laid-back singer-composer and casual philanderer.</TE>
<TE>   Mike (Christopher De Leon) is a New York correspondent for the
Philippine Times unhappily married to Gigi (Susan Valdez-LeGoff),
whose inheritance has allowed her to indulge in nouveau riche tastes
and a lot of grand airs. Mike and Gigi have two children: a little
boy, Mark (Jason Verdadero), and a girl, the pretty but sullen Candy
(Martha Millan), in her rebellious teens.</TE>
<TE>   Gerry (Ricky Davao) is a pleasant-looking ad agency veteran passed
over for a promotion but not giving up. Gerry has unexpectedly and
rapturously fallen in love but has trouble admitting to his friends
that his lover, Chris, is a man (Wayne Maugans). Gerry's struggles in
coming out, especially to his mother (Gloria Romero, a formidable
veteran actress) back in the Philippines, are at once the source of
outrageous humor and genuine pain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This wide span of emotions is handled with a sure sense of control
and compassion by Guillen. The shift in tone also applies to the
plight of Raul (Paolo Montalban), who is Marissa's cousin, and who
arrives at the party typically late and with his latest conquest in
tow. Raul is devilishly handsome and proudly callow but may be
heading for a fall.</TE>
<TE>   Once set in motion by Tere's dinner party, "American Adobo"
unfolds during the course of a year. This span of time provides a
perspective that imbues the film with a sense of the eternal human
comedy. "American Adobo" is an intimate, good-humored ethnic comedy
like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers and their wonderful cast are unafraid of emotion,
and they catch us up in the lives of their people to such an extent
that they can get away with some honest tear-jerking as well as some
very funny business, including an amusingly contrived way of wafting
a bit of romance in the direction of the lovely and lovable Tere. Not
the least of "American Adobo's" delicious ingredients is lots of
heart.</TE>

<HD>Diverse Worlds of Two Prep Teams</HD>

<LD>For football fans across the country and beyond, New Orleans is the
center of the universe this week, where one of the most grandiose
sporting events in the world will unfold Sunday before a sellout
crowd and a television audience of millions.</LD>
<LD>   But A&amp;E's focus at 9 tonight is on football on a smaller stage,
where athletes still in their teens play out dramas that for them can
seem equal to that of any Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "Wide Open: Inside the World of High School Football" is a
hard-hitting two hours that follows a pair of prep teams across the
2001 season: the Jefferson High School Democrats from Los Angeles and
West Texas' Stephenville High Yellowjackets.</LD>
<TE>   The schools are separated by much more than geography. The
Yellowjackets are an almost exclusively white team, hailing from the
cattle ranches and dairy farms of suburban Erath County. Jefferson's
roster of blacks and Latinos and its urban setting fill the other
half of the equation.</TE>
<TE>   There are common denominators, such as the struggle for gridiron
success and the hopes for college scholarships and even the NFL, but
the differences are given center stage.</TE>
<TE>   While the Texas players' world is portrayed as one of workouts,
church dances and trips to the diner, the Jefferson players are shown
coping with graffiti, broken homes and even parenthood. Police
cruisers are prominent at their games and the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people consider this the killing fields," says Democrats
Coach Hank Johnson. "This is one of the toughest areas of Los
Angeles, bar none."</TE>
<TE>   The playing field is far from level, yet a strong sense of
camaraderie and some quiet heroes emerge from both teams. For the two
schools, as well as tonight's viewers, it's a season to remember.</TE>

<HD>Offbeat 'Tuvalu' Casts Its Own Quirky Spell</HD>
<DH>Veit Helmer's black-and- white fairy tale captures the
conflict between the pull of the past and the lure of the future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veit Helmer's "Tuvalu" is a jaunty, captivating fairy tale told
essentially in mime and shot through with the sooty humor of its
Eastern European locale.</LD>
<LD>   This one-of-a kind charmer casts an immediate and delightful
spell, and could never have happened without its enchanting setting,
a vast and crumbling Beaux Arts building. Helmer found the building
in the heart of Sofia, Bulgaria, although for purposes of the story
it's supposed to be in that country's town of Varna, on the Black
Sea. Box Office magazine aptly summed it up as "equal parts Emir
Kusturica and Charlie Chaplin, with a dash of "Metropolis."</LD>
<LD>   An old steamship conks out in Varna in the midst of a storm, and
its captain (Djoko Rossich) and his pretty young daughter Eva
(Chulpan Hamatova) take refuge in an old hotel. It and the
cathedral-like public bath nearby are the only buildings standing in
a wide open space scheduled for redevelopment.</LD>
<TE>   When father and daughter go to the baths, they encounter a
dilapidated interior with a large pool circled by wide colonnaded
balconies giving way to a dome decorated with a bas-relief of
Neptune. Grand staircases surround the pool, into which water pours
from a cornucopia held by a mermaid statue seated at its edge.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding over all this faded grandeur like a general is Karl
(Philippe Clay), the blind, imperious master of the baths--and the
building's owner--who is continually giving orders to his devoted,
hard-working son Anton (Denis Lavant).</TE>
<TE>   Anton is forever repairing the ancient building and its creaky
machinery and leaky roof the best he can. He plays tapes of people
frolicking in the pool to maintain the illusion for his father that
the baths are as popular as ever, when in reality they attract only
an elderly person now and then. The plunge's kindly cashier (Catalina
Murgea) has long accepted buttons in place of coins for her handful
of impoverished customers.</TE>
<TE>   Two parallel story lines develop and ultimately converge: the
lethal machinations of Anton's smarmy brother, Gregor (Terrence
Gillespie), to bulldoze the baths for profit as part of the
redevelopment project, and the budding romance between Anton and Eva,
who discovers in her father's old chest a map locating the island of
Tuvalu, presumably the site of buried pirate treasure.</TE>
<TE>   The crux of the matter is Anton's experiencing the conflicting
pull of a past that's rapidly deteriorating and the equally strong
lure of the future, with Eva representing promises of romance and
adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Helmer carries off this lively, offbeat tale with unfailing
aplomb. Cinematographer Emil Cristov's mastery of the richness of
black-and-white images is equal to that of cameraman Roger Deakins'
contribution to "The Man Who Wasn't There."</TE>
<TE>   The pug-nosed, wiry and diminutive Lavant, best known for such
Leos Carax films as "Lovers on the Bridge," is a born mime, as
wistful as a clown, and he is by far the film's dominant figure.</TE>
<TE>   There's scarcely more dialogue in "Tuvalu" than in Chaplin's "City
Lights" and "Modern Times," and like those films, "Tuvalu" has an
evocative score and sound effects. Helmer searched throughout his
native Germany, then Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and
Russia for exactly the right indoor pool before finding it in
Bulgaria. His search for the perfect locale--and the perfect cast
too--was well worth the effort.</TE>

<HD>Manager Keeps Order in the Court</HD>
<DH>Administrator Gerald Kippen makes sure things run smoothly,
even with the unhappiest customers in town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every weekday morning, those wishing to gain access to the Pasadena
courthouse--lawyers, jurors, witnesses and a few defendants--wait
together in a long line that inches forward along the outside of the
building.</LD>
<LD>   By looking at their faces, Gerald Kippen can determine how the
rest of his day will go.</LD>
<LD>   "You can tell by the people coming in if it's going to be a good
day or if we have problems," said Kippen, the administrator for Los
Angeles County Superior Court's Northeast District, which, besides
Pasadena, includes the Alhambra, Burbank, Glendale and Monrovia
courthouses. "You can get your finger on exactly what's going on."</LD>
<TE>   The 64-year-old court veteran, a slender man with bushy eyebrows
and a mustache, observes the lengthy procession from a perch near the
metal detector and conveyor belt at the building's entrance. Kippen,
who has been part of the court system for more than 40 years and is
its longest-serving current court administrator, remains invigorated
by the people whom he serves.</TE>
<TE>   "We always say that we have the most unhappy customers in the
world," he said. "They are either being sued or are defendants in a
criminal case or in a family law case. A lot of people coming here
have never been to court before. It's a new experience. They are
terrified. You try to help them as much as possible."</TE>
<TE>   As administrator of the Northeast Division, a job he's held since
1984, Kippen oversees a budget of $18 million and a staff of more
than 300 people.</TE>
<TE>   He is responsible for overseeing everything that does or does not
happen at the five courthouses. For example, he must make sure that
the courtrooms are staffed with court reporters, clerks and bailiffs,
that the judges are following recent changes in law and court
procedures and even that the elevators are running properly.</TE>
<TE>   One recent afternoon, Kippen had to help get things back under
control after an angry man, in court to take care of a traffic
ticket, punched through a window, causing glass to hit a court
employee.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he is a member of the supervisory committee of the
Courts and Records Federal Credit Union and is the co-chairman of
special services for Los Angeles County's Management Council, for
which he helps organize educational conferences.</TE>
<TE>   "Gerry Kippen is the professor emeritus of court administrators,"
said Judge Mary Thornton House, supervising judge at the Pasadena
courthouse. "He's done almost everything you can do as a court
administrator, and he has tremendous credibility with both the people
who work for him and the judges who work with him."</TE>
<TE>   Kippen, a Kentucky native who now lives in Burbank, joined the
L.A. court system in 1961, fresh out of the University of Louisville.
He has worked his way up its ranks, from entry-level clerk to court
clerk to supervising court clerk.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his career, he considered becoming a lawyer, and even
took classes at Southwestern University School of Law, but his long
days in court took their toll.</TE>
<TE>   "Things happen," he said. "I ended up staying."</TE>
<TE>   The most memorable career moments, Kippen said, came early.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, he was a clerk in the courtroom where the first Onion
Field trial, in which two men were convicted of the abduction and
murder of a Los Angeles police officer, was held. "I was sitting
there and one of the attorneys came in and told us that John F.
Kennedy had been killed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Working for Judge Earl Broady Sr. in the late 1960s, Kippen met
jazz musician Chet Baker, who had come in to appear on charges
relating to a drug problem. "That I will never forget," Kippen said.
"He used to bring us records."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Kippen has helped to inaugurate drug and domestic
violence courts, establish a call-in system for traffic violators and
move his courts to a one-day, one-trial jury system.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, the people working alongside him have dealt with
the day-to-day business of the legal system, offering up everything
from small claims to search warrants and handling everything from
family courts to criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   Kippen said many of the issues and conflicts have remained similar
during his tenure, but the court personnel have changed dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was an entry-level clerk, they used to give the court
clerk positions to the old-timers. Most of the court clerks were the
older workers, and we had very few women then. The job wasn't as
demanding," he said. "It's changed dramatically in the time I've
worked here. Now, it's a younger, more diverse group, with different
attitudes. It's a steppingstone for wherever they want to go."</TE>
<TE>   Kippen--who holds a season pass to Disneyland, loves old movies
and attends "oldies but goodies concerts" whenever he has the
chance--often slips into the habit of speaking about his job in
religious terms. He is a shepherd of sorts, and this job, he says
repeatedly, sustains him.</TE>
<TE>   Kippen's wife, Linda, who also worked as a court clerk, died last
year after battling melanoma for five years. He is now raising their
two teenage children, a boy and a girl, alone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough on me," said Kippen, who also has an adult son
from a previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have watched him struggle with his wife's death said
that even when he was distracted by what was going on at home, Kippen
found solace at work.</TE>
<TE>   "He's my hero," House said. "He let the tragedy make his work life
important, and I think we have all benefited from that. His wife
would be real proud of him, how he's continued on, taking care of the
family. It's been very heartwarming to observe."</TE>
<TE>   Kippen has been with the county for so long that when he retires
he will be entitled to receive 100% of his $102,000 base salary
annually. But he is tenacious in his desire to continue doing what he
has been doing for so many years.</TE>
<TE>   "If I retired I could do a lot of volunteering," he said. "But I
can do more here. I can help more people here."</TE>
<TE>   Kippen said one of his immediate challenges involves the recent
addition of the Burbank and Glendale courts to his district.</TE>
<TE>   "The sheriff condemned the lockup in Glendale. We are trying to
work out some issues," he said. "It's something or the other almost
every day. That's what makes the job interesting."</TE>

<HD>J. Miner, 81; Led Outward Bound USA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joshua L. Miner, an innovative educator who introduced Outward Bound
to the United States in 1961 and continued to be the guiding light
for the confidence-building wilderness education program over the
last four decades, has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Miner, former dean of admissions at Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass., died of prostate cancer Tuesday at his home in Andover.</LD>
<LD>   "My dad was an educator who loved the outdoors and was interested
in experiential education," said Miner's son, Dan Miner.</LD>
<TE>   "He often said that if you can find a mission or a passion in your
life, you're very lucky. And that's what Outward Bound was for him."</TE>
<TE>   Miner was introduced to Outward Bound in 1950 while teaching at
the Gordonstoun School in Scotland, where he met Outward Bound's
founder, Kurt Hahn, an Oxford-educated German.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn had developed the adventure-based experiential education
program during World War II at the request of a British shipping line
owner, who felt the line's young sailors needed training to be able
to endure the hardships of spending days on a life raft in the event
their ships were sunk by German submarines.</TE>
<TE>   Miner, who joined students in Scotland on their
confidence-building expeditions, took Hahn's concepts home with him
and initiated an innovative physical education program based on
Hahn's principles at Phillips Academy in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, he started Outward Bound USA in Colorado, near Marble,
with 80 students. Miner served as director.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Outward Bound USA has five wilderness schools--in Portland,
Ore., Ely, Minn., Asheville, N.C., Rockland, Maine, and Denver--and
urban centers in New York and Boston. Together they draw nearly
40,000 students a year.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they're sailing, mountain climbing, desert backpacking,
white-water rafting, dog sledding or sea kayaking, the goal is the
same.</TE>
<TE>   "Outward Bound courses are about discovery, and you can discover a
lot about yourself in the wilderness," said Stocky Clark, chief
operating officer of the Garrison, N.Y.-headquartered nonprofit
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Through taking people out of their comfort zone, putting them
with a group they've never met before and going through all aspects
of an expedition--from cooking meals to navigating mountains and
oceans--they learn teamwork, leadership, character development and
compassion for each other."</TE>
<TE>   Miner stayed involved with Outward Bound until the end, Clark
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is our inspiration," Clark said. "There wasn't a board meeting
in which Josh didn't say something very significant. He had a great
deal of wisdom and a tremendous belief in youth and people and the
principles of Outward Bound--the focus on service, compassion and
character development."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Plainfield, N.J., Miner attended Phillips Exeter Academy
in New Hampshire and graduated from Princeton University in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served as a captain in the 696th Armored
Field Artillery Battalion with Gen. George S. Patton's 3rd Army in
Europe. He received a Bronze Star with five combat stars, a Purple
Heart and the Croix de Guerre.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Miner was assistant headmaster and a physics and
math instructor at the Hun School, a small boys boarding school in
Princeton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   During his two years at the Gordonstoun School in Scotland, he
taught math and served as director of athletics under Hahn's
guidance.</TE>
<TE>   At Phillips Academy from 1952 to 1964, he served as a physics
instructor, housemaster and P.E. coach.</TE>
<TE>   As founding trustee and chairman of Outward Bound USA, Miner spent
the first eight years building the organization.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, he returned to Phillips Academy and served as dean of
admissions until retiring in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring, he served as an education consultant. Until about
10 years ago, he would take business executives on short Outward
Bound trips down the Green River in Utah in summer.</TE>
<TE>   Miner was co-author of "Outward Bound USA" (William Morrow; 1981).</TE>
<TE>   In addition to son Dan, of Durham, N.H., Miner is survived by his
wife of 54 years, Phebe; daughters, Phebe M. Richards of Costa Rica
and Louise M. Miner of Minneapolis; sons, Joshua L. IV of Boxford,
Mass., and John of Seattle; two brothers, Frank of Denver and Tom of
Sarasota, Fla.; and 12 grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>From Associated Press</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Hovhannes Tertzakian, former leader of the Armenian
Catholic Church in the United States and Canada, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Tertzakian was struck by a car in front of his home in Belmont,
Mass., a Boston suburb, Monday and was pronounced dead later that day
at Mt. Auburn Hospital. The matter was under investigation by the
Middlesex County district attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   From 1995 to 2000, Tertzakian led the Apostolic Exarchate for
Armenian Catholics in the United States and Canada, overseeing about
36,000 Armenian Catholics from his headquarters at St. Ann's
Cathedral in New York.</TE>
<TE>   An exarchy is a church jurisdiction established for Eastern
Catholics living outside their native lands.</TE>
<TE>   Tertzakian was born in Aleppo, Syria, and entered the Mekhitarist
Monastery of St. Lazarus in Venice, Italy, in 1935.</TE>
<TE>   He served as rector of Moorat-Raphael College in Venice and of
Samuel-Moorat College in Sevres, France, as well as an administrator
at schools in Egypt and Syria before moving to the United States in
1986. He was elevated to leadership of the exarchy in 1995 by Pope
John Paul II.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral Mass was scheduled for Saturday at Holy Cross Armenian
Catholic Church in Belmont. Tertzakian will be buried in Venice.</TE>

<LD>This weekend, after a 21-year gap, Los Angeles hosts the National
Hockey League's All-Star game, which gathers the world's best
professionals to celebrate their talents. In a bit of nationalistic
nostalgia the festivities will include an exhibition game today
involving most of the players from the 1980 "Miracle on Ice" U.S.
Olympic team.</LD>
<LD>   At noon Saturday the hockey world's eyes--and television sets in
175 countries--will be trained on Staples Center as the refreshed
format pits the best players from Canada and the United States
against the best players from everywhere else in the world. That's
appropriate for a city as diverse as ours and a reflection of both
the sport's changing makeup and many of the names we'll hear during
the coming Olympic competitions.</LD>
<LD>   The NHL, which actually was international from inception, has
diversified drastically. At the 1917 founding, a third of the six
teams were Canadian; today, 80% of the 30 teams are American, many
from warm-climate cities like L.A. and Miami, next year's All-Star
site. A quarter-century ago 97% of league players were Canadian;
current competitors come from 22 countries. Barely half are Canadian,
15% are American, a third are from Europe. Many of the league's games
go global on satellite TV, and all are on the Web.</LD>
<TE>   The game comes while a worried world confronts an international
terrorism network. In one sense this deft ballet on ice involving
rapid men with sticks and a seven-ounce rubber disk is an act of
defiance against the xenophobia of the religious fundamentalists who
killed thousands of many nationalities Sept. 11. The three-hour
contest here pits players of various colors and tongues--Pavol, Teemu
and Jaroslav against Jarome, Rob and Paul--with hearty handshakes
before and afterward. Viewers will cheer favorites and ooh at the
magical moves these men make at 24 miles an hour on thin steel
blades.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, it's just a game played by a diverse band of well-paid
men, a passing metaphor for the wins, losses and less clearly
resolved conflicts of ordinary lives. Sunday the players return to
their own teams. But at a time like this when the weapons of
intolerance have been aimed with awful accuracy at so many ordinary
lives and now-shattered assumptions, it's grand to witness an event
with enduring excellence and sportsmanship--and to host it here for a
watching world.</TE>

<HD>Shield for Immigration Court</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When, say, a mother and her children flee to the United States after
escaping from a dictator slaughtering people for worshipping the
wrong god, one of 220 federal immigration judges decides whether to
let them stay or make them go. These same judges decide the fates of
foreign students who overstay their visas and immigrants charged with
minor crimes. Now, because of Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's heavy-handed
crackdown on immigrants after Sept. 11, which includes new limits on
judicial discretion, these judges themselves are seeking a sort of
asylum.</LD>
<LD>   The National Assn. of Immigration Judges, an AFL-CIO-affiliated
union, is asking that its members be removed from Justice Department
control and perhaps constitute themselves as a new, separate federal
court. The judges say that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which argues the government's cases before them, unduly
influences the Justice Department's policies and practices, an
influence that frequently spills over to judicial matters. The
particulars they cite include Ashcroft's directives that let the INS
override immigration judges' decisions to release Sept. 11 detainees
on bond and that order judges to close their courtrooms to the public
in every case involving those detainees.</LD>
<TE>   The judges are particularly concerned that their current
organizational arrangement undermines the essential fairness of the
immigration proceedings they conduct, that such core American values
as judicial independence and impartiality have been compromised. And
because immigration judges serve at the pleasure of the attorney
general, with no Civil Service job tenure, they feel vulnerable to
intimidation and interference from within the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1983, these judges worked directly for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, but this arrangement proved rife with
conflict since INS lawyers argue the government's cases before them.
As a result, Congress created the Executive Office for Immigration
Review, an arm of the Justice Department. Now it's time to change
again.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Security judges who settle benefits disputes and
bankruptcy judges who sort out what's owed to creditors operate with
far more independence than immigration judges. Since the 1940s, many
administrative judges have been protected by Civil Service and
procedural rules that help ensure that their decisions are governed
by the merits of the cases, not political or bureaucratic pressures.
Immigration judges have every right--and good reason--to demand the
same protections.</TE>

<HD>Keep a Line Open to Arafat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, having twice sent an envoy to the Middle
East and having warned Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
countless times to arrest terrorists and stop the violence, now has
moved more deeply into the camp of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon. A step back is in order.</LD>
<LD>   The big winners since the start of the second uprising against
Israel 16 months ago have not been Israel or the Palestinian
Authority or the United States. They have been the two main
Palestinian terrorist groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, both singled
out for condemnation by President Bush in his State of the Union
speech.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's ''targeted assassination'' of individual terrorists has
not increased the nation's security, and its settlements in territory
that Palestinians believe Israel promised to return have inflamed
passions. Palestinian terror groups have made bitter enemies of many
Israelis who once supported the peace process. How can a man whose
wife has been murdered by a suicide bomber support a deal with a
group whose members include terrorists? Counseling peace is easy.
Turning the other cheek is difficult.</LD>
<TE>   Then there's the economic toll. Shopkeepers on Jerusalem's Jaffa
Road have lost business because customers don't want to risk being in
an area where a Palestinian gunman raked a line of people waiting for
a bus and days later--last Sunday--a Palestinian woman killed herself
and an Israeli bystander and wounded scores of people when a bomb she
was carrying exploded. In the occupied territories of the West Bank
and Gaza, Israeli checkpoints keep people from leaving to earn a
living. The Palestinian economy is a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   The United States' basic support of Israel, of course, must remain
unshakable. Israel, founded after the Holocaust, is a democracy in a
region where many of its neighbors refuse to recognize its right to
exist. It has been forced to fight for its survival in four wars.</TE>
<TE>   Last month Israeli commandos seized a boat carrying 50 tons of
rockets, mortars and explosives to the Palestinian Authority. Bush
and his advisors then discussed shutting the authority's Washington
office and putting Arafat's personal security force on the State
Department's list of terrorist groups. It's hard to see how that
would help matters.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has to keep the channels of communication open
with the Palestinians. Yes, the Palestinian Authority is corrupt and
despised even by many of those it represents. But it's the only
organization to talk to now.</TE>
<TE>   The main burden is on Arafat to stop the violence. If he can't or
won't, Israel and the United States will have to look elsewhere for a
partner in dialogue. But there is no guarantee things will improve
when Arafat dies or is removed.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is due to visit the White House next week. He should bring
not merely a justification for keeping Yasser Arafat under virtual
house arrest but proposals for returning to the peace process. And,
while Bush should work with Sharon toward that end, it would be
foolish for the president to embrace the lifelong hawk as the only
personification of the olive branch.</TE>

<HD>It Is Proper to Honor CIA Officer Spann</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is certainly Jacob Heilbrunn's prerogative to not give the CIA
credit for doing anything right in its history ("CIA's New Celebrity
Exposes Its Failings," Opinion, Jan. 27). What is beyond the pale,
however, is his suggestion that Director George J. Tenet "seized
upon" the death of CIA officer Johnny Michael Spann to "trumpet the
CIA's key role in the war effort" against terrorism. This assertion
does a great disservice to Tenet and the agency he leads, as well as
to Spann's family.</LD>
<LD>   The Times reported on Nov. 27 that a CIA officer may have been
killed or wounded in Afghanistan, a day before the agency publicly
acknowledged Spann's employment--once his death had been confirmed
and his remains had been recovered. Over the years, when
circumstances have permitted, the CIA has publicly identified agency
officers who have been killed in the line of duty. It was determined
that Spann's affiliation with the CIA could be acknowledged without
doing any harm to intelligence sources, methods or operations. Just
as important, the Spann family strongly supported the decision to
confirm his employment and honor his sacrifice.</LD>
<TE>   We may never be able to reveal the name of every CIA officer who
dies in the line of duty. We will remain silent when we must, but we
will honor the names publicly when we can, not with the cynical
motive Heilbrunn suggests but, as with Spann, to honor true patriots
whose heroic contributions to keeping America safe and free deserve
the public's recognition and gratitude.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Perfect Soldier," by Terry McDermott, Jan. 27: Mohamed el Amir
Atta seems less the product of a repressive Egyptian government
(though it surely exists) than the inevitable result of the collision
between the modern world's reality and that of a hermetic upbringing
in a household ruled by an unyielding and fearful father. McDermott
devastatingly emphasizes how history's course is often changed by the
actions of a few perverted losers unwilling or unable to fathom the
world that surrounds them.</LD>

<TE>   While it may be necessary to examine the personal history of a
Mohamed Atta, referring to him as a "soldier" (and a "perfect" one,
at that) demeans a necessary and noble profession. Whatever his
motivations and convictions may have been, Atta was, ultimately,
nothing more than a depraved criminal.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article on Atta was quite chilling, but his lifestyle and
beliefs point out a problem every religion on Earth has to deal with.
A small percentage of people in each religion strive only to focus on
Allah, Yahweh or God and despise everything else he has created, from
nature to music to humor to sensuality.</TE>
<TE>   Atta's anger at even having feelings of hunger forcing him to eat
and his avoiding any kind of food that might give him pleasure as it
simply goes into his mouth show the very contempt he and people like
him have toward any uplifting emotions or feelings. It has little to
do with the actual religion so much as their own disgust at
themselves and the world around them. Anything pleasurable distracts
them from their own self-hatred and hatred toward everything else.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban's overt hatred of women, shown by making them wear
full-length veils and beating them when they walk in the streets,
reveals the underlying weakness of their beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Their God is a self-hating God. A weak and vulnerable one who
cannot protect them from their own feelings of arousal of any kind,
whether it is the smell of flowers in a garden, a wonderful dinner,
or the perfume or cologne of a member of the opposite sex, which for
a second causes them bliss.</TE>
<TE>   That God of hatred died in the aftermath of Sept. 11; they just
don't know it yet.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Vows to Take War on Terror to Hostile Nations, Calls for
Unity," Jan. 30: The pedestrian semantics of President Bush's speech
writers sounded much the same as Ronald Reagan's, who penned the
simplistic "evil empire."</LD>
<LD>   Why not rely upon the United Nations before committing our
resources to eliminate the scourge of terrorism worldwide? One need
only look at the official French reaction (who owe their very
existence to us) to know that memories are short and that most
countries will remain noncommittal until the wolf is at their door.
The United Nations provides the only acceptable stage for this
challenge.</LD>

<TE>   David Hood (letter, Jan. 31) questions President Bush for "not
having the guts to come out and declare [war]." The reason Hood
states is so the Bush administration doesn't have to give the
detainees "those nasty 'rights.' "</TE>
<TE>   So, if Hood is correct, our undeclared war wasn't about the
unprovoked attack on our country, or the thousands of victims who
lost their lives or their families. It isn't even about the thousands
who lost their jobs, which may never come back. It's not about the
hundreds of firefighters or NYPD officers who are now suffering
respiratory problems. We went halfway around the world and spent
billions of dollars just so we could capture a couple hundred guys
and bring them to a tropical island, feed them bagels and cream
cheese and give them their own religious leader. That must have been
what we wanted the whole time.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush had declared war, or the attack an act of war, none of
those victims would have been able to file any life insurance claims,
nor would any of the businesses affected by the attacks be allowed to
do so, because the losses would have occurred due to an act of war,
thus voiding any claims. Now, unless Hood was in Afghanistan, took
part in the war effort and helped to capture and interrogate these
detainees, I would suggest that he let the highly trained
professionals handle this one.</TE>

<TE>   It always starts with a war.</TE>
<TE>   The president or chief has to be in charge. Everyone rallies. Then
he needs more authority. What's a little more authority in times of
crisis?</TE>
<TE>   Then he needs more domestic control. Well, that makes sense. How
can a president fight a war without home security? He may need to
listen in on private conversations. If your conversations need to be
private, maybe they're dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Then the war gets hotter and the president needs a few more
extraordinary powers. He shouldn't have to consult opposition leaders
to make decisions. Everyone must sacrifice during wartime.</TE>
<TE>   Are we there yet? You decide.</TE>

<TE>   While volunteering is a noble pursuit, it should not be used as a
means for business and government to shirk their responsibilities to
contribute to the common good. Specifically, Bush adds insult to
injury when he calls for teachers and nurses to volunteer. These
professionals have for too long been overworked, underpaid and
undervalued. Instead, I would like to see our president propose that
Enron executives and other corporate pirates "volunteer" their
ill-gotten profits to bail out beleaguered trauma centers and schools
in the inner cities.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Does Graham Fuller have a crystal ball that assures him of the
opinions that he states as fact ("Bush Must See Past the Acts of
Terror to the Root Causes," Commentary, Jan. 29)? How can he say that
"terrorism against Israelis will be applauded by virtually every
Palestinian . . . until their sovereign state has been established"?</LD>
<LD>   These Palestinians applaud terrorism now, they applauded it when
the peace process seemed to be working, they applauded it when the
Palestinian Authority was given every bit of sovereignty it has
received and they applauded it against the United States on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Are we truly to believe that it will end if they are granted their
own country? If the Arab world's only wish is for the Israeli borders
to be redrawn back to the pre-1967 lines, why did it feel a need to
stage an offensive in 1967 in the first place?</LD>
<TE>   Dan Schochet</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson Ranch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fuller's sense of indignation is a very selective one. Happily he
preaches the uselessness of force and violence when applied by
Israel. He ignores how violence and terror from the Palestinian side
helped get Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon elected in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Reisman</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fuller aptly called the present Israeli-Palestinian situation a
case of collective madness. The whole idea of fighting Hamas by
blowing up Palestinian Authority police stations, offices and radio
stations, killing policemen, putting Yasser Arafat under virtual
house arrest, destroying people's houses, humiliating them, all with
a lot of "collateral damage," and then expecting the PA to eradicate
Hamas and other terrorists 100% is madness and a prime example of
motivating people in the wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   One can guess that Hamas leaders thank God for Sharon because he
brings them so many volunteers for the suicidal missions. As Fuller
says, the result is more Israeli casualties. That Sharon, who is a
simple-minded bully, follows this madness is not surprising. However,
why the U.S. administration is supporting this madness is beyond
comprehension.</TE>

<LD>Re "Davis TV Ads Attack Riordan," Jan. 29: The first time I saw Gov.
Gray Davis' hit piece on Richard Riordan I thought how pathetic and
desperate the governor must feel about his reelection prospects.
While abortion is an issue that certainly evokes strong feelings from
just about all voters wherever they stand on the subject, it is
perhaps the biggest non-issue facing the voters of California today.</LD>
<LD>   The abortion issue in California was firmly decided when Ronald
Reagan was governor. Any voter who buys into this fear-mongering
tactic is paranoid, proving that it isn't what Davis stands for but
what the voters will fall for that ultimately rules the day.</LD>

<TE>   I can't stand it any longer--I have to speak out! Richard Riordan
was worthless as mayor of Los Angeles. In my area, the harbor area,
we got nothing--reduced LAPD support, little graffiti cleanup,
increased noise, truck traffic and pollution in the toxic-wasteland
harbor. Thanks for a whole lot of nothing while he was mayor.</TE>
<TE>   I would vote for Davis a hundred times over before I would vote
for Riordan--and Dick, don't even try to stick Davis with the energy
deregulation thing. It won't work.</TE>

<LD>One would normally welcome the addition of a new national monument if
it were not for a disturbing pattern that seems to emerge whenever
the Bush administration makes new decisions on the use of public land
("National Monument in Utah Proposed," Jan. 29).</LD>
<LD>   The San Rafael Swell in eastern Utah certainly deserves this
special recognition, but why is it necessary to have the approval of
those who stand to profit from this land before it can be considered?</LD>
<LD>   President Clinton's creation of Escalante National Monument in
southern Utah angered many local oil, mineral and grazing interests,
but the majority of Americans overwhelmingly support his decision. If
Bush wishes to create his legacy for the American people, he needs to
listen to all of them and not just the ones who contributed
generously to his campaign.</LD>

<HD>2 More Airlines Post Big Losses</HD>

<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two more airlines, Delta and America West, on Thursday joined most
other U.S. carriers in posting sizable fourth-quarter losses in the
face of what Delta Chairman Leo Mullin called "challenges unlike any
we've seen in the history of aviation."</LD>
<LD>   Delta Air Lines Inc., the nation's third-largest airline, lost
$486million, or $3.97 per diluted share, after excluding one-time
items such as the cash Delta received as its portion of the
industry's federal bailout. The results were a tad worse than the
$3.89-per-share loss expected by Wall Street analysts, as surveyed by
Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   A year earlier, Delta earned $79million, or 60 cents a share. Its
fourth-quarter revenue tumbled to $2.9billion from $4billion a year
earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Hammered by the drop in passenger traffic after Sept. 11 and the
economic recession, the airline industry has been hit with massive
losses in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta-based Delta, with many routes concentrated in the East,
was particularly hard-hit after the attacks in New York and at the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   For all of 2001, the industry is poised to lose more than $6
billion (excluding the bailout money). United Airlines' parent, UAL
Corp.,  will be the last major airline to report its fourth-quarter
results when it makes its announcement today.1</TE>
<TE>   America West Holdings Corp., based in Phoenix, said its
fourth-quarter loss (excluding one-time gains and charges) was $89
million, or $2.64 a share, which matched analysts' forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   America West so far is the only airline to receive a federal loan
guarantee, which was another component of the bailout package. Most
airlines have not yet applied for that aid.</TE>
<TE>   In other airline news, Alaska Air Group Inc. said its board
elected William Ayer as chief executive of Alaska Airlines to succeed
John F. Kelly, 57, who remains chairman and chief executive of the
carrier's Seattle-based parent company.</TE>
<TE>   Ayer, 47, currently is Alaska's president, and the company said
the promotion was one of several personnel changes that were part of
a long-term executive-succession plan for both Alaska Airlines and
the company's other unit, the regional airline Horizon Air.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Switzerland's national airline was renamed Swiss Air Lines
after its predecessor, Swissair, collapsed from financial problems
last fall. The new airline will fly under the name Swiss and take
over Swissair's network--which includes Los Angeles--on April 1.</TE>
<TE>   Delta's stock closed Thursday at $31.60 a share, up 3 cents, while
America West slipped 2 cents to $3.96  and Alaska Air fell 23 cents
to $30.66 a share, all on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>California Amends Credit Lyonnais Suit</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Atty. Gen. Lockyer adds Apollo Advisors and Leon
Black to Executive Life case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has added a fresh crop of
defendants to a multibillion-dollar lawsuit that accuses Credit
Lyonnais and affiliates of the French bank of using phony business
fronts to illegally acquire the assets of the defunct Executive Life
Insurance Co. in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   In an amended complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, Lockyer named Apollo Advisors of New York, Apollo President
Leon Black--a former close associate of junk bond king Michael
Milken--and three Apollo partners. The suit claims they helped to
conceal the bank's role in the purchase of Executive's insurance
business and junk bond portfolio for $3.25 billion.</LD>
<LD>   California law bars foreign governments from owning insurance
companies, and at the time of the purchase, the French government was
majority owner of Credit Lyonnais. Moreover, under a federal law,
since repealed, banks were prohibited from owning more than 25% of an
insurance company.</LD>
<TE>   Knowing this, the lawsuit states, Credit Lyonnais fronts and
affiliates lied to the state to secure its approval of their bid for
Executive Life. California authorities would not have approved the
sale but for the "false statements and concealments," says the suit,
which was originally filed in June.</TE>
<TE>   "Covert business arrangements that illegally included foreign
investors were used to acquire the assets and bond portfolio of
Executive Life at fire-sale prices," said Lockyer, who filed the
amended complaint Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Apollo and Black, the amended suit names John J. Hannan,
an Apollo principal, and Craig M. Cogut and Eric B. Siegel, former
partners. The men followed Black to Apollo after the collapse of
Drexel Burnham Lambert and the criminal conviction of Milken.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Weiner, general counsel for Apollo, on Thursday called the
charges "irresponsible and baseless." He said the allegations were
especially surprising because the state insurance department--which
is pursuing a separate lawsuit--determined his clients should not be
charged.</TE>
<TE>   The civil litigation is not the worst threat to Credit Lyonnais.
Last April, the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles told the bank
that it plans to seek an indictment on charges that might include
mail and wire fraud, money laundering and making false statements to
the Federal Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   But federal prosecutors gave the bank's lawyers time to appeal the
decision to the Justice Department. Those discussions are continuing,
and French authorities have asked the State Department to intervene
on the bank's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, more than 300,000 policyholders lost billions of
dollars in the failure of Los Angeles-based Executive Life, which had
been one of the country's largest life insurers. Along with life
insurance, the company sold high-interest annuities, banking on high
returns from a $6-billion junk bond portfolio it had assembled with
Milken's help.</TE>
<TE>   But the insurer's fortunes fell with the junk bond market in 1989,
and frightened policyholders began cashing out their policies.
Then-state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi wound up seizing the
business.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1991, Garamendi and a superior court judge approved
the sale of the bonds and insurance business to a consortium led by a
French insurer, MAAF. According to the lawsuit, the consortium was a
front for the bank and a subsidiary, Altus Finance, which would
maintain the real ownership and control.</TE>
<TE>   The cast of characters and complex transactions multiply in the
amended complaint. It says that at the time of the sale, Apollo was
acting as an investment advisor to Altus, and was to share in profits
from the insurance business and bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds included stakes in American companies that could be
extremely valuable when the market rebounded. In 1992, Credit
Lyonnais sold a portion of the bond portfolio to a company owned by
French tycoon Francois Pinault, another defendant in the case.
Altogether, authorities say, the individuals and businesses named in
the case realized profits of more than $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although the state insurance department is pursuing a parallel
suit on behalf of Executive Life policyholders and creditors, its
lawyers have told the Apollo group that they won't be sued.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an evaluation of the evidence," said Gary Fontana, a
lawyer for the insurance department. "We reached one conclusion, and
I guess they [the attorney general] reached a different" one. "We
made the decision it was not appropriate to sue someone we thought
was innocent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, Lockyer's suit accuses some 25 defendants of violating
the state's false claims and unfair competition acts, along with the
federal anti-racketeering, or RICO, law. It seeks damages of $6
billion.</TE>

<HD>Calpine Profit Drops 17% as Demand Falls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp., one of the biggest U.S. power producers, said Thursday
that its profit fell 17% in the fourth quarter as electricity prices
dropped because of lower industrial demand and mild weather.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose-based company said net income declined to
$111.5million, or 33 cents a share, from $134.7 million, or 40 cents,
a year earlier, even as revenue climbed 57% to $1.72 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The results matched the average estimate of analysts polled by
Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Electricity prices fell more than 50% in most of the U.S. last
quarter, dropping 90% on the California-Oregon border, according to
Bloomberg Energy Service statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine, which produces enough power to supply 11.1 million U.S.
homes, has about half its generators in California.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine nearly doubled its generating capacity in the last year to
11,100 megawatts. Costs of buying and marketing power almost tripled
to $916.4 million, though, even as gas prices fell 59% on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Calpine rose 14 cents to $11.20 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have tumbled 72% in the last year, along with other
power producers, after the collapse of energy trader Enron Corp.
raised investors' concerns about debt-laden companies.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine said its total debt more than doubled in the last year to
$12.7 billion. It has $1.8 billion in cash on hand, Chief Executive
Peter Cartwright said.</TE>
<TE>   Another major energy provider, Entergy Corp., reported a 47% drop
in earnings to $26.6 million, or 9 cents a share, as revenue fell 28%
to $1.89 billion.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans-based Entergy sells electricity to about 2.6 million
customers in Southern states and operates nine nuclear power
generators.</TE>
<TE>   Entergy shares rose $1.31 to $41.18 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from California companies, excluding one-time items
unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * Cheesecake Factory Inc. said fourth-quarter income grew 16% to
$10.9 million, or 23 cents a share, on an 18% jump in revenue to
$148.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Dole Food Co. said fourth-quarter profit from continuing
operations was $4.1 million, or 7 cents a share, beating analysts'
estimates of 4 cents, as it cut costs in its core banana business.
The results exclude a gain of $168.6 million from the sale of its
Honduran beer unit. Sales fell 1.9% to $982.5 million. Dole had a
loss of $18.2 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * Gilead Sciences Inc. reported a fourth-quarter loss of $22.9
million, or 24 cents a share. Analysts had expected a 29-cent loss.
The biotechnology company said revenue, including sales from the
recently introduced Viread HIV treatment, rose 42% to $74.3 million.
The latest results exclude a $154.5-million gain from the sale of its
cancer business. Gilead lost $18.4 million, or 20 cents a share, a
year ago.</TE>

<HD>4 Audit Firms May Ease Role in Consulting</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Proposal aims to restore confidence in industry
after controversial work by Andersen for Enron.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four of the nation's largest accounting firms said Thursday that they
would be willing to give up at least some of their lucrative but
controversial consulting work in an effort to restore confidence in
their industry.</LD>
<LD>   Similar limitations, considered by the Securities and Exchange
Commission two years ago, failed to win support after lobbying by the
accounting industry.</LD>
<LD>   The stance was announced individually by KPMG,
Pricewater-houseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young and Andersen. Deloitte &amp;
Touche, the other member of the Big Five accounting group, remained
uncommitted and called for more discussion.</LD>
<TE>   The announcements come as lawmakers are calling for new
restrictions on accounting firms after the bankruptcy of Enron Corp.
and questions about auditor Andersen's role in the failure.</TE>
<TE>   "These firms and the industry are attracting tremendous heat and
they want to placate their critics and the public," said Rick Antle,
a Yale University accounting professor.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co. became the first major corporation to
say it would no longer use its outside accounting firm for new
consulting projects and would review those underway.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Michael Eisner said the debate over auditor
independence had convinced the entertainment giant to "take decisive
action," even though current safeguards had worked well.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Disney paid its accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
$8.6million for its auditing and $32million for other services,
according to its proxy statement.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed policy on consulting discussed Thursday would apply
to information technology and internal audit consulting by accounting
firms, but not necessarily on all types of consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the American Institute for Certified Public
Accountants, the profession's largest trade organization, said there
is no evidence that limiting consulting work will improve the quality
of audits or prevent Enron-style meltdowns. Nonetheless, they would
support the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firms often earn more for consulting than auditing and
provide a wide range of financial services, tax advice and other
corporate guidance. Enron, for example, paid Andersen $25 million for
its audit and $27 million for consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the accounting industry, however, question whether the
push Thursday to restrain consulting would limit potential conflicts
of interest in audits.</TE>
<TE>   Of the top five accounting firms, all but Deloitte &amp; Touche have
sold or are divesting their consulting units that performed much of
the information technology consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Yet at the same time the companies maintain other types of
consulting relationships with their clients.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a first step, but we can't lose sight of the
other types of consulting work that are of concern and we can't
ignore the need to strengthen oversight of the profession," said Lynn
Turner, former chief accountant for the SEC and one of the main
proponents of limiting consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) and Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) plan
legislation that would restrict a broad range of the consulting work
that accounting firms do for audit clients. They said through a
spokesman that limiting just the two types of consulting is a
positive step but does not go far enough. Corzine is a former
co-chairman of Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, work classified in SEC filings of public companies as
"non-audit" generates tremendous billings for the large accounting
firms.</TE>
<TE>   For example, General Electric Co. paid KPMG $23.9 million for its
2000 audit, but it also paid the accounting firm $11.5 million for
financial information systems design and implementation, $13.8
million for tax services, $15.5 million for "nonfinancial statement
audit services" and $38.9 million for information technology
consulting not associated with the financial statements, according to
SEC filings.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of this is really hard to sort out," Antle said. "When a
client that is considering a merger asks the accounting firm how the
deal would be treated, is that auditing or consulting?"</TE>
<TE>   Although opposed to the proposal when it was first broached by the
SEC in 2000, KPMG Chairman Stephen Butler said Thursday that he
believes it is now in the best interests of the accounting
profession.</TE>
<TE>   "Concerns over perceived conflicts between audit and non-audit
services have so far dominated the public debate over the role of the
auditor," Butler said. The "red herring" of the conflict-of-interest
issue, he said, has limited debate over what he believes is a more
important issue for investors--an auditing and financial reporting
system that has not kept pace with dramatic changes in business.</TE>
<TE>   He said a financial reporting system "designed for the Industrial
Age" no longer works in the Information Age.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we should accept previously proposed limits on
non-audit services and move forward," Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   PricewaterhouseCoopers, which also announced plans Thursday to
spin off its consulting practice, was in favor of the original SEC
proposal and has not changed its opinion, company spokesman David
Nestor said.</TE>
<TE>   But not all of the industry is on board.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a huge perception problem, and we fully acknowledge that
this perception problem needs to be solved so that all of the
interested parties can deal with the more substantive issues ... ,"
Deloitte &amp; Touche said in a statement. "But, it is premature to
accept or reject any single proposal, whether we agree with it or
not, because the effectiveness of a complete set of reforms is what
ultimately needs to be assessed."</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said agency Chairman Harvey L. Pitt
has not taken a position on the consulting-fee proposal broached by
KPMG on Thursday but that in the wake of the Enron collapse and its
reverberations through the financial markets, the regulator
"considers everything is on the table this year."</TE>

<HD>Credit Suisse Reports $1-Billion Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Credit Suisse First Boston reported a $1-billion fourth-quarter loss
as Chief Executive John Mack fired 2,500 employees and settled U.S.
regulatory charges of violating rules in stock sales.</LD>
<LD>   Charges totaling $646 million left the investment bank's parent,
Credit Suisse Group, with a loss of $468 million, spokesman Paul
Rimmer said. Switzerland's second-biggest bank started reporting
quarterly earnings in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The losses, which also reflect unprofitable investments in
Argentina and Enron Corp., are wider than those of rival securities
firms except Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   CSFB, which ranked fourth among merger advisory firms last year
and fifth in stock underwriting, reported a $289-million loss in the
third quarter, prompting Mack to pledge $1 billion in cost
reductions. That included firing 9% of the firm's payroll of 27,623.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, CSFB said it named Stephen Volk as chairman. Volk
succeeds former Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. CEO Joe Roby.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB's fourth-quarter charges included a $100-million settlement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers, following allegations the firm benefited from
kickbacks in exchange for allotting investors sought-after shares
from initial public offerings. Charges for cutting staff amounted to
$745 million.</TE>
<TE>   After tax, fourth-quarter charges totaled $646 million. In
addition to the charges, the firm lost $213 million on Argentine
securities and $126 million investing in Enron.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB's full-year loss was about $961 million, compared with a
profit of $1.41 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Other company earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges
unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * French telecommunications equipment supplier Alcatel reported a
fourth-quarter loss of $1.3 billion, largely because of restructuring
charges and inventory write-downs, in line with its earlier forecast.
But the company generated a positive operating cash flow of $1.73
billion in the quarter, helping it trim debt far below its goal.
Sales fell 20% to $5.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Computer Sciences Corp. said fiscal third-quarter profit rose as
it reduced costs and was hired to manage more corporate and
government computer systems. Net income rose to $87.1 million, or 51
cents a share, from $65.6 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier. Sales
rose 9% to $2.9 billion from $2.66 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * MGM Mirage Inc., which gets two-thirds of its revenue from Las
Vegas casinos, said fourth-quarter profit fell 65% on a drop in
tourism after the September terrorist attacks. Net income fell to
$23.7 million, or 15 cents a share, from $68 million, or 42 cents, a
year earlier. Revenue fell 12% to $896.3 million, as cash flow fell
36% at the Bellagio and 35% at MGM Grand.</TE>
<TE>   * Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said fiscal second-quarter earnings rose
8.8% after the largest U.S. household-goods maker boosted sales for
the first time in more than a year. Net income rose to $1.3 billion,
or 93 cents a share, from $1.19 billion, or 84 cents, a year earlier.
Sales climbed 2.2% to $10.4 billion, boosted mainly by the newly
acquired Clairol hair-care line.</TE>
<TE>   * Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc., owner of the Westin
and Sheraton hotel chains, had its first loss since 1998 as the
September terrorist attacks led to a drop in international travel.
Starwood had a loss of $54 million, or 28 cents a share, compared
with profit of $131 million, or 64 cents, a year earlier. Revenue
fell 21% to $878 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Verizon Communications Inc. reported fourth-quarter profit of
$2.1 billion, or 77 cents a share, virtually unchanged from a year
ago, as declining sales in its core local telephone business offset
higher sales of long-distance, high-speed Internet access and
wireless services. The results, which exclude a $1.4-billion charge
for job cuts, matched analyst expectations. Revenue rose less than 1%
to $17 billion, below Wall Street forecasts of $17.17 billion.</TE>

<HD>Cost Cutting Helps Disney Post a Surprise 1st-Quarter
Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co., which has been reeling from a slowdown at its theme
parks as well as a television advertising slump, surprised analysts
Thursday with better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results,
mostly because of aggressive cost cutting.</LD>
<LD>   Disney posted net income of $438 million, or 21 cents a share, for
the quarter ended Dec. 31, contrasted with a net loss of $36 million
a year earlier. Included in this year's results was a $216-million
gain on the sale of Knight Ridder Inc. stock.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue for the quarter fell 5% to $7.05 billion, from $7.43
billion. Excluding one-time charges and gains, Disney's net income in
the quarter fell 55% to $297 million, or 15 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   Still, those "pro forma" results were better than Wall Street
expected. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call estimated
Disney would earn 10 cents a share, pro forma, in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The results, announced after the stock market closed, pushed
Disney's stock to $22.19 in after-hours trading. Disney shares closed
at $21.06, down 34 cents, on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives said attendance at the company's theme parks are
showing signs of recovery and predicted tourist traffic would return
to growth by year-end.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now one difficult quarter closer to a new day of growth at
Walt Disney Co.," Chief Executive Michael Eisner said in a conference
call.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs expects its
operating profit to decline 10% to 15% in the next three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is obviously making the very best of a bad
situation," said Chris Dixon, an analyst with UBS Warburg. "There's
every reason to believe that if the economy returns, Disney will
continue to benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives attributed the better-than-expected results to
vigilant cost cutting in the movie studio, theme parks and consumer
products division, which has shut 50 Disney Stores.</TE>
<TE>   All told, Disney has cut 4,000 jobs in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Disney and other media and entertainment companies have been
battered by the economic slowdown after the  Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Disney  has been suffering from a deep ratings slide at its ABC
network, which two years ago was the No. 1 broadcast network on the
strength of the game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, it has dropped to its current slot as the No. 4 TV
network among total U.S. households.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, operating income at Disney's media networks
divisions, which includes ABC, fell 58% to $246 million because of ad
declines and poor ratings. The firm recently replaced ABC's
entertainment chief in hopes of improving ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "ABC is one of the biggest under-performers of the company," said
Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Gerard Klauer &amp; Mattison. "The
management changes are one attempt to build a solution, but it's
still a long-term process."</TE>
<TE>   In October, Disney paid $5.2 billion for the Fox Family TV
channel.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has been considered more at risk than its media peers
because one-third of Disney's operating income typically comes from
theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Operating income for Disney's parks and resorts division fell 51%
in the first quarter. Theme park attendance fell 20% at Walt Disney
World last quarter on concerns about travel after the terrorist
attacks, and now is about 15% below last year's levels.</TE>
<TE>   Although attendance at Disneyland was up in the first quarter
because of the opening of the California Adventure theme park, guest
spending was down 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's studio entertainment division had a flat quarter, with
the huge success of "Monsters, Inc." offset by marketing costs on
upcoming films.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner also said Thursday that Disney would no longer use its
outside auditing firm for consulting projects. In 2001, Disney paid
PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.6 million for its auditing and $32 million
for other services.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Disney opposed an effort by some shareholders to bar its
auditor from providing these consulting services. But the debate over
auditor independence, and possible conflicts of interest, has become
a hot topic on Wall Street since the Enron Corp. debacle.</TE>

<HD>Credible Accounting Is the New Essential</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The current rage on Wall Street over accounting and the quality of
corporate earnings is a little like a hangover victim swearing never
to touch another drop. Big investors have known for years that
company accounts have been mildly or even seriously fictional. And
yet that made little difference in their investment decisions.</LD>
<LD>   But clear and credible accounting is making a difference now, in
the wake of Enron's collapse amid disclosures of hidden debts and
overstated profit.</LD>
<LD>   Investors this week dumped stocks of companies deemed guilty of
obscure accounting or understating liabilities in their financial
reports.</LD>
<TE>   And those investor reactions already are forcing changes in
corporate reporting and in the accounting profession. Some of these
changes:</TE>
<TE>   * Companies will have to end or severely limit their use of
off-balance-sheet partnerships that hold debt or assets away from
their reports to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Enron had used such partnerships extensively to make its
financial situation look better than it actually was.</TE>
<TE>   * Accounting firms will get new regulation, and they will have to
separate auditing of company books from other services to clients,
such as management and information technology consulting.</TE>
<TE>   * Companies generally will have to bolster their credibility by
fully explaining all profits and losses, assets and liabilities. They
will have to stop using loosely defined "operating income" in
presentations to investment analysts, who themselves are coming in
for fresh scrutiny by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The rising trend is regulation of financial reporting. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the corporate world's
rule-making body, said Thursday that it planned to change the rule on
special partnerships of the kind that allowed Enron to effectively
place debt off its balance sheet. The board is working with the SEC
to tighten rules on disclosure of debts and contingent liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   That reform is part of a general coming-clean by companies that
saw their stocks clobbered this week. The stock of Williams Cos., a
natural gas pipeline and producing firm, fell an additional 2% on
Thursday to $17.68 a share. It is down 27% from Tuesday, when the
company told shareholders of a potential $2-billion liability from
debts it had guaranteed for a subsidiary last year but failed to tell
investors about previously.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant Corp., owner of Avis rental cars and Days Inn hotels, said
Thursday that it was putting on its Web site information about
off-balance-sheet ventures previously undisclosed to shareholders.
Investors this week had driven Cendant stock down 10% before the
announcement. They promptly sent it back up 6% to $17.48 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firms were eager to burnish their images. Samuel
DiPiazza Jr., chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the largest
accountancy firm, said he welcomed regulation of his industry by an
oversight committee that will be set after a suggestion from SEC
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   DiPiazza was not merely being diplomatic in welcoming regulation.
Accountants, who are being criticized these days, say the corporate
customer frequently has as much to do with poor accounting as the
auditor. A national, government-sanctioned oversight body could
strengthen the auditor's hand in disputes with company managements.</TE>
<TE>   An expert watchdog of corporate accounting, Howard Schilit of the
Center for Financial Research &amp; Analysis in Rockville, Md., says,
"Firmness and strength in the accounting firms' head offices is
necessary to clean up these trends in corporate reporting."</TE>
<TE>   DiPiazza also announced that his firm would spin off its
consulting division as a separate company to dispel the appearance of
a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the perception of conflict of interest is something we
must deal with," DiPiazza said.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts about the quality of corporate earnings are not new. But
the 1990s boom made matters worse, says Srinivas Thiruvadanthai, a
researcher at the Jerome Levy Economists Institute at Bard College
outside New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The institute, founded in the 1930s by an economist who believed
that corporate profits drove the U.S. economy, issued a study last
fall estimating that U.S. company earnings have been overstated by
20% in recent years and by more than 10% for decades. The study
received attention from the institute's investment company clients,
Thiruvadanthai says, but not because the findings were new.</TE>
<TE>   "We told our investment clients about overstated earnings for
years. They told us in past years that even if they paid attention,
stocks of the companies kept going up. But now it is different since
Enron."</TE>
<TE>   One abuse the Levy study focused on was the increased use by
companies of "operating earnings" as a guide for investment analysts.
Firms would instruct investment markets to judge them by earnings
before many costs such as interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA. That would help stock market valuations, the
study reported.</TE>
<TE>   "But then firms would come back later with write-offs because of
greater depreciation or other business events and cast doubt on the
whole earnings picture."</TE>
<TE>   While the bull market was raging, such subtleties of accounting
were mere technicalities to investors. But with stock prices and the
economy struggling and Enron casting shadows of doubt on all
corporate behavior, clear and credible accounting has become the new
essential for any company looking for support from investors.</TE>

<HD>Explorer Design Defective, Jury Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BARSTOW</DL>
<LD>A Superior Court jury ruled Thursday that Ford Motor Co.'s Explorer
sport-utility vehicle is "defective by design," in what was thought
to be the first time the auto maker was found liable for
manufacturing and shipping a faulty Explorer model.</LD>
<LD>   A Barstow jury ruled 10 to 2 on Thursday evening in favor of Agop
and Catherine Gozukara, whose four-door 1994 Ford Explorer rolled
over on a California highway three months after they bought it in
1997. Agop Gozukara suffered severe leg injuries in the accident and
his wife was paralyzed for life, their attorneys said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time in history that a jury has found this
vehicle to be defective in design, in that it has a propensity to
roll over," said Garo Mardirossian, attorney for the plaintiffs.</LD>
<TE>   However, Mardirossian said, the jury determined that damages will
be paid by the dealer that sold the used Explorer--not Ford--and by
the California Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   A Ford spokesman said he was unfamiliar with the case and could
not immediately comment. Plaintiffs' lawyers said the portion of the
trial in which financial damages are set will begin Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ford has struggled with issues related to its best-selling
Explorer SUV since August 2000, when the U.S. unit of Japanese tire
maker Bridgestone Corp. said it would recall 6.5 million Firestone
tires fitted mainly on Explorers. Ford later said it would replace
all 13 million Firestone Wilderness AT tires on its vehicles because
of "substantial failure risk."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government has said that more than 200 people have died
in accidents linked to the tires or to Ford vehicles. Ford claimed
the safety problems at issue were caused by Firestone tires, while
Firestone blamed the accidents on the Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   The Barstow jury ruled not only that the Ford Explorer model
involved in the case was defective but that it was faulty when Ford
shipped it, according to a release issued by the plaintiffs'
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's redesigned 2002 four-door Explorer posted rollover ratings
comparable with those of other SUVs, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration reported last fall. A separate NHTSA
investigation found that the rollover risk for Explorers was no
greater than for other SUVs during incidents of tire tread
separations or blowouts.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Ford said it has ordered dealers to stop selling many
of its 2002 Ranger pickups because of a problem with the rear axle.</TE>

<HD>GM's Management Changes  to Shake Up Design Process</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. announced management and organizational changes
Thursday that will shake up the way it designs new vehicles. The
moves will result in an undetermined number of job losses.</LD>
<LD>   For the world's biggest auto maker, the moves are seen as a
significant step in deflating its legendary bloated structure that
experts saw as an impediment to keeping pace with changing trends.</LD>
<LD>   "They're clearly going in the right direction. First and foremost
they're getting rid of the bureaucracy, which will speed up the
process so they can get products to market more quickly," said Chris
Cedergren of the automotive market research firm Nextrend.</LD>
<TE>   "The best thing is they're putting more control in the hands of
people that should be more responsible for products, designers and
planners," Cedergren said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Hogan, president of e-GM, will immediately assume the
position of group vice president of advanced vehicle development.
Wayne Cherry, vice president of GM Design, will now lead the
realigned design organization.</TE>
<TE>   The impetus for the changes came with the September arrival of
Robert Lutz to oversee product development. He was later appointed
chairman of GM's North America division. Hogan, 50, and Cherry, 64,
will report directly to Lutz.</TE>
<TE>   "We must move with a laser-like focus at getting great-looking,
low-cost, investment-efficient products into our system quickly,"
Lutz said. "Mark Hogan's role in blending great designs with the
other imperatives should shorten our total development times and,
most importantly, ensure that we have the right products."</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it is reducing its 13 vehicle line teams
into 11 by consolidating two of them. The result will be a loss of
some jobs, but that number has yet to be determined, spokesman Tom
Kowaleski said.</TE>
<TE>   GM shares rose 78 cents to close at $51.14 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>ImClone Saga Shows Biotech Risk</HD>
<DH>Investments: Analysts question why Bristol-Myers didn't
see problems in firm before acquiring 19.9% stake. Congressional
probe may offer answers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the mysteries surrounding the implosion of ImClone Systems Inc.
is the terrible timing of a $1.2-billion investment in the company by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</LD>
<LD>   The pharmaceutical giant acquired 19.9% of ImClone at $70 a share
in October, two months before ImClone's stock collapsed amid
allegations that the small biotechnology company had misled investors
about prospects for its cancer drug Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   Bristol-Myers has not commented in detail about its investment
since the Food and Drug Administration refused Dec. 28 to accept
ImClone's application to market Erbitux, triggering ImClone's slide.
Documents that Bristol-Myers had been asked to deliver to a
congressional committee by Thursday should begin to offer clues.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts who follow the pharmaceutical industry suspect the
documents will show that Bristol-Myers, anxious to keep its edge in
the lucrative oncology drug business, either ignored or failed to see
problems the FDA and others later raised about Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   "In their eagerness, they made broad assumptions about the data
[on Erbitux] and, apparently, did not dig into the nuts and bolts,"
said Eric M. Yee, a research vice president with Murphy Investment
Research in Half Moon Bay, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The ImClone saga underscores the riskiness of investing in
biotechnology when even savvy companies with full access to
information can get caught. "These stocks aren't for small
investors," said Eric S. Sharps of investment firm FourSquare
Partners in Los Altos, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA, in its rejection letter to ImClone, cited numerous
problems with the clinical trials the company conducted to test
Erbitux in colon cancer patients. The confidential rejection letter,
obtained by an industry publication called Cancer Letter, said new
trials "would be needed" to show whether Erbitux worked.</TE>
<TE>   Before it made the investment, Bristol-Myers had full access to
ImClone internal documents about Erbitux, said ImClone Chief
Executive Samuel Waksal. Bristol-Myers "did real due diligence.
[They] feel comfortable this is an approvable drug," he said. But
Waksal, speaking to investors last month, said he did not know
whether people from Bristol-Myers reviewed all the data.</TE>
<TE>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin, has asked Bristol-Myers to provide a list of people
who conducted due diligence of ImClone, the opinion of Bristol-Myers'
oncology committee about Erbitux and audits and investigations of
ImClone conducted by Bristol-Myers. Peter Dolan, chairman and CEO,
pledged last week to comply "fully with any and all requests" by the
panel.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is investigating allegations, raised in numerous
shareholder suits, that ImClone misled investors; Waksal has denied
that charge. Besides Bristol-Myers, the panel is seeking documents
from ImClone and the FDA. It isn't known whether the documents will
be made public.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers at first spurned overtures from ImClone, a
17-year-old company with no products. Bristol-Myers representatives
"conducted due diligence" during the summer of 2000, according to a
regulatory filing, but they decided against a "strategic
transaction."</TE>
<TE>   By last April, the top brass at Bristol-Myers had changed their
minds. Bristol-Myers Vice President Brian Markinson, working through
Lehman Bros., sent word to Waksal that the big drug maker was
interested in a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts speculated that Bristol-Myers had become nervous about
its shrinking oncology franchise and thought Erbitux could replace
sales being lost to generic versions of Taxol, its blockbuster
chemotherapy drug.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of generic competition on Bristol-Myers became evident
last week, when the company reported that worldwide Taxol sales
plummeted 25% in 2001 to $1.2 billion. Leading the decline was a 45%
revenue drop in the United States, as oncologists switched patients
to knockoff versions of the cancer drug.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile last spring, a buzz had grown around Erbitux, a new type
of treatment that targets growth receptors found on the surface of
many kinds of cancer cells. Bristol-Myers later said it expected
sales of Erbitux to reach at least $1.5 billion by 2005, putting it
in the same league as Taxol.</TE>
<TE>   Markinson, the Bristol-Myers vice president, at first proposed
that his company acquire as much as 80% of ImClone for stock valued
at $65 a share. His proposal included a separate marketing deal for
Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in mid-May, representatives of Bristol-Myers went
through ImClone's books and files, including the company's "clinical
development ... intellectual property and regulatory affairs,"
according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
By late June, for reasons not specified in the SEC document,
Bristol-Myers backed away from acquiring a majority stake in ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   Since the companies began talking, ImClone shares had risen to
about $50 from $40. Wall Street was excited by research data
presented at a May medical conference that showed a combination of
Erbitux and a chemotherapy drug helped 22.5% of 121 colon cancer
patients who received the treatment. (The FDA, according to the
Cancer Letter, later found that the study was flawed.)</TE>
<TE>   Waksal told Bristol-Myers CEO Dolan that he would consider an
alternative proposal, but any deal must involve "a significant equity
investment" from Bristol-Myers. Waksal suggested a deal structure
that would reward shareholders directly. "Stockholders would benefit
most if [Bristol-Myers] acquired an equity interest through a tender
offer," Waksal told Dolan, according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, the two companies sketched the outline of a deal;
besides the $1-billion tender offer, it included a separate Erbitux
marketing pact worth as much as $1billion for ImClone. Bristol-Myers
also got two seats on ImClone's board. It completed the tender offer
in October.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal and brother Harlan Waksal, ImClone's chief operating
officer, sold their shares to Bristol-Myers for $111.3 million.
Another director, Dr. John Mendelsohn, president of the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston, received $6.5 million. ImClone Chairman
Robert F. Goldhammer, a New York investment banker, received $25.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Since the FDA's rejection of Erbitux, Bristol-Myers has written
down its investment in ImClone by $735 million. Dolan last week
called Erbitux "a top priority for Bristol-Myers Squibb, me and my
senior management team."</TE>
<TE>   The company is devoting its "considerable oncology resources" to
refiling an acceptable application with the FDA "if at all possible."
Dolan acknowledged what Wall Street has already assumed: that the
launch of Erbitux could be delayed. Bristol-Myers had expected to
launch Erbitux with ImClone in April.</TE>
<TE>   Any delay increases the vulnerability of Erbitux to competition
from new drugs that also target the same growth receptors on cancer
cells. The investment firm Goldman Sachs does not expect Erbitux to
reach the market until 2004. By then, at least one and possibly two
competing drugs will be available.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA is reviewing AstraZeneca's application to market Iressa
for head and neck cancers; Erbitux is conducting clinical trials for
those cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its partner, Genentech
Inc., expect to file an application for approval to market a similar
drug, called Tarceva.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone shares closed Thursday at $19.16, down 87 cents, on
Nasdaq. Bristol-Myers closed at $45.37, up 44 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Higher on Renewed Confidence</HD>
<DH>Markets: Rally isn't enough to keep key indexes from losing
ground in January, which is seen as a barometer for the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks rallied for a second day Thursday on optimism about the
economy, but it wasn't enough to lift key indexes into positive
territory for January--which could be a bad sign for the year.</LD>
<LD>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.5% on the day but finished the
month down 1.6%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% but lost 0.8%
for the month.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials rose 157.14 points, or 1.6%, to 9,920. With
Wednesday's gain of 144 points, the Dow has recouped all of Tuesday's
plunge, when stocks sank on fears of more accounting-related
scandals. But the Dow too lost ground in January, off 1%.</LD>
<TE>   According to the "January barometer," the direction of major
indexes in the first month usually foretells the rest of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, small and mid-sized stocks fared better than blue chips
last month, continuing a 2-year-old trend. The S&amp;P small-cap index
rose 0.8% in January while the S&amp;P mid-cap index eased 0.6%.</TE>
<TE>   A more tongue-in-cheek market barometer will send its signal this
weekend: the Super Bowl indicator, which for much of the last 35
years accurately "predicted" an up year for stocks when a team from
the original NFL won and a down year when an old AFL team won. Market
bulls may hope the favored St. Louis Rams prove the oddsmakers right,
but bears note that the indicator has fumbled for four straight
years.</TE>
<TE>   However, the January barometer generally has worked well since
1950, according to Ned Davis Research of Venice, Fla. When the S&amp;P
500 has sagged in January, the index has slid an average of 1.8% in
the rest of the year; when the index has risen in January, it has
gained an average of 12.8% in the next 11 months.</TE>
<TE>   But the barometer failed in 2001, as a January rally last year
gave way to a dismal year.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's rally, amid heavy trading, was fueled by renewed hopes
for an economic pickup, analysts said. Personal income rose in
December, new data showed, lending credence to the Federal Reserve's
upbeat outlook Wednesday. Winners topped losers by 2 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange on Thursday and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Gainers included consumer names such as Procter &amp; Gamble, which
rose $3.39 to $81.68 after reporting brisk quarterly sales, and Kraft
Foods, up $1.56 to $37.06 a day after raising profit projections.</TE>
<TE>   Chip bellwether Intel gained $1.18 to $35.04 on an upgrade by
Merrill Lynch. Elsewhere in tech, IBM climbed $2.34 at $107.89.</TE>
<TE>   Defense contractors rose in anticipation of higher military
spending. Lockheed Martin gained $2.51 to $52.97, and Raytheon
climbed $1.11 to $38.27.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, Treasury yields continued to edge higher in
anticipation of a stronger economy. In currency trading the Japanese
yen fell to a fresh three-year low against the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Though blue-chip stocks carried the day Thursday, the so-called
January effect apparently bolstered smaller stocks last month.</TE>
<TE>   The January effect has historically referred to smaller stocks'
tendency to beat bigger stocks in the first month of the year, in
part because smaller names may suffer more from tax-related selling
at year's end, and thus are primed for a bounce.</TE>
<TE>   Satya Pradhuman, director of small-cap research at Merrill Lynch,
notes that smaller "value" stocks did especially well last month,
continuing their strong performance of 2001. "Investors are more
valuation-sensitive these days, more judicious," he said. "That may
accidentally lead them to lower-cap names."</TE>
<TE>   As for the Super Bowl indicator, it has been accurate in 28 of 35
years--but wrong since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, it has helped the indicator that the majority of
football teams are from the old NFL, and that the stock market rises
more years than it falls.</TE>
<TE>   Academics rail against the indicator as sheer coincidence. Still,
said Prudential Financial market strategist Robert Stovall, "it
outperforms any gaggle of gurus or econometric model I've ever heard
of."</TE>

<HD>Mattel Posts Profit Gain of 21% for 4th Quarter</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc. reported a 21% gain in quarterly profit Thursday despite
a modest sales increase. Cost controls helped boost full-year profit
by 20%, excluding one-time charges.</LD>
<LD>   With a sales gain of 2%, to $1.6 billion, during the company's
holiday selling period, the toy maker reported fourth-quarter
earnings of $146 million, or 33 cents a share, not including one-time
charges, compared with $120.6 million, or 28 cents a share, for the
same period a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   For the year, Mattel earned $351.6 million before charges, or 82
cents a share, up from $293.3 million, or 69 cents, in 2000. Sales
rose 3% to $4.8 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The company also announced it was cutting 240 jobs at its U.S.
facilities, including at its El Segundo headquarters and at the
Fisher-Price division in East Aurora, N.Y</TE>
<TE>   Including charges related to the company's closure of its U.S.
manufacturing facilities and other one-time costs, Mattel posted 2001
net income of $298.9million, or 69 cents a share, compared with a net
loss of $431million a year earlier, or $1.01 a share. The 2000 loss
was related mostly to the firm's failed Learning Co. interactive
unit, which it has since divested.</TE>
<TE>   The latest quarter's charges included a 4-cents-a-share reduction
for the write-down of debt related to the bankruptcy filing of Kmart
Corp., which accounts for 6% of Mattel's sales.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, Mattel Chief Executive Robert
Eckert said strong foreign sales have helped offset slow domestic
results. He reiterated that Mattel expects annual earnings growth to
be at least in the low-double-digit range over the next three to five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel shares rose 35 cents to $19 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Mighty J.P. Morgan in the Hot Seat</HD>
<DH>Banking: Charges of collusion with Enron and its recent
hefty losses raise questions about firm's judgment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the rubble of recent financial collapses, one prestigious
institution seems especially vulnerable: J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., the
nation's second-largest bank.</LD>
<LD>   The New York company, a lead lender to Enron Corp., Kmart Corp.
and telecommunications firm Global Crossing Ltd., is at risk of
losing billions in dealings with bankrupt firms, as well as losing
heavily in Argentina's economic meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   J.P. Morgan also lost $1.1 billion last year on its stakes in
businesses, including many ailing technology companies, and is
accused by insurers of helping Enron conceal vast losses. Morgan
strongly disputes the charge, but the allegation, coupled with the
hefty losses, raises questions about the judgment of an institution
that traces its roots back more than 200 years.</LD>
<TE>   The bank's woes, accompanied by sizable losses on loans at many
other financial giants, also reveal chinks in a banking industry
generally regarded as a pillar for the nation's recovery from an
economic slowdown and from Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan fares badly in comparison with big competitors such as
Citigroup Inc., the largest U.S. banking concern, and Bank of America
Inc., the third-largest. Despite their huge losses in Argentina,
Enron and other corporate collapses, Citigroup earned $4 billion and
BofA posted a profit of $2 billion in the fourth quarter, bolstered
in part by robust consumer lending.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, by contrast, lost $332million in the fourth quarter,
compared with a $708-million profit a year earlier. For the year, the
company still earned $1.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's skittishness over projected losses at J.P. Morgan
has been apparent in the steady stock sell-off in recent weeks after
a "continuing parade of train wrecks," in the words of analyst E.
Reilly Tierney at Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The stock, which traded above $40 early in December, hovered near
$32 this week before closing Thursday at $34.05, up 99 cents a share,
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts remain bullish on Morgan, saying the institution is
fundamentally sound and the financial setbacks are only temporary.
And by some industry measures, J.P. Morgan's financials look sturdy.
A key ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets, for example, was
just 0.87% as of Dec. 31, well below the 2% figure regarded as a sign
of potential trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' concerns surfaced in December after Enron's bankruptcy,
when J.P. Morgan, which had a reputation for usually disclosing bad
news promptly and completely, suddenly tripled its estimate of its
potential Enron losses, to $2.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $1 billion of the total stemmed from insurers' refusals to
pay Enron-related claims on unfulfilled energy contracts. The
insurers contended in a lawsuit filed in federal court in New York
that the losses resulted from J.P. Morgan's setting up "sham"
offshore energy trading concerns to do business with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan contends its energy trading companies were above
board, adding that--unlike Enron--it included the results on its
balance sheets.</TE>
<TE>   The bank also says the hefty loan losses from the mammoth
bankruptcies are a result of J.P. Morgan's position as the leading
arranger of the biggest credit lines to the biggest businesses. These
so-called syndicated loans are carved up and shared by dozens of
banks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're handling 40% of the syndicated loans, and when companies go
down we tend to be exposed," said J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin
Lemkau.</TE>
<TE>   But other banks in the syndicates typically take on responsibility
for more than 90% of the amounts lent. Though J.P. Morgan arranged
$1.6 billion in credit lines for Kmart, for example, it had just $117
million in unsecured loans when the retailer filed for bankruptcy
last month. Likewise, though J.P. Morgan had helped arrange $2.25
billion in loans for Global Crossing, it's now owed less than $100
million by the telecom firm, according to people close to the
situation. And while J.P. Morgan still has a $500-million exposure to
Argentina, Citigroup and FleetBoston have far more.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, only about 10% of J.P. Morgan's earnings come from lending
these days, compared with 50% a decade ago, Lemkau said, meaning its
comparative credit risk exposure actually has declined dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's no denying the bank's missteps, which include an 8%
stake in an Argentine bank accused of fraud, and loans to a European
cable TV company that has threatened to default on $17.5 billion in
debt.</TE>
<TE>   Prospects looked far brighter at the end of 2000, when J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co. emerged in its current manifestation via the colossal
merger of Chase Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   After deregulation tore down walls separating banks, brokerages
and insurers, the idea was to compete better with Citigroup--itself
formed in the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group--by selling more
services to clients. The newly formed giant hoped especially to
persuade companies with bank loans to use J.P. Morgan's investment
banking services, which typically are more profitable than commercial
lending.</TE>
<TE>   But the technology meltdown, the recession and Sept. 11 combined
to create the worst environment in years for stock offerings, mergers
and other staples of investment banking.</TE>
<TE>   The big question now, Tierney said, is whether J.P. Morgan failed
to assess credit risks properly at companies because it figured
making loans was a sure path to bigger profit on other services.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lemkau said the dollar amount of corporate loans on J.P.
Morgan's books has declined for the last three years. "It's a
misconception we're lending like a drunken sailor so we can get our
hand on more profitable businesses," she said. "It's just not true."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt reflecting the uncertainties facing all financial
institutions after Sept. 11 and the Enron meltdown, the range of
expert opinions about Morgan is astonishingly wide.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, such as Michael Mayo at Prudential Financial, have
slapped "sell" ratings on the bank while others, such as Diana P.
Yates at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., rate it a "strong buy."</TE>
<TE>   Yates characterized concerns over the insurers' allegations of
collusion with Enron as "overdone." She also warned against judging
J.P. Morgan by its admittedly atrocious last quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "They're taking some hits, but they're a big company with a
$41-billion equity base. It's not like they're going out of
business," she said.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Watchdog Reiterates It Will Disband</HD>

<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Public Oversight Board, the accounting industry watchdog,
Thursday reiterated its intention to disband by the end of March
despite a plea from Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, to reconsider.</LD>
<LD>   Charles A. Bowsher, the board's chairman, notified Pitt in a
one-page letter, saying in part: "Given the recent events and the
SEC's proposal for a new structure, we believe that we cannot
effectively oversee the activities of the accounting profession and
it would mislead the public to seem to do so."</LD>
<LD>   The five-member panel voted unanimously to disband after Pitt had
failed to consult the group before unveiling his own proposal for a
new oversight system for the accounting industry in the wake of the
Enron Corp. debacle.</LD>
<TE>   Pitt believes that the Public Oversight Board's independence is
compromised because the board receives all its funding from the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the industry's
trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher has said he fears the new board proposed by Pitt could
come to be dominated by the accounting profession. The Public
Oversight Board, despite its funding source, has no members with
direct ties to the Big Five accounting firms.</TE>

<HD>Providian Is Delaying Results</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Struggling credit card issuer Providian Financial Corp. delayed
announcing its fourth-quarter results Thursday because executives
said they need more time to discuss the company's financial woes with
federal banking regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company said it would delay the
announcement until Feb. 7, and provided little detail on the reasons
for the decision.</LD>
<LD>   At the beginning of the week, Providian had affirmed it would
disclose its results Thursday. The company announced the delay just a
few hours before a scheduled conference call.</LD>
<TE>   "We continue to make good progress in finalizing the key
components of our capital plan with our regulators," said  Chief
Executive Joseph Saunders.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned by heavy losses in Providian's credit card portfolio,
regulators imposed controls on the  firm's operations to protect
nearly $16 billion in insured deposits.</TE>
<TE>   Providian's shares fell 21 cents, or 5%, to close at $3.75 on
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock plunged 94% in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "This can't be good news. It looks like they are running an
open-door liquidation of the company," said analyst Charlotte
Chamberlain of Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Providian may be negotiating with regulators about the amount of
special charges to be booked in the fourth quarter, said analyst
Matthew Park of Thom Weisel Partners. If the charges are too large,
Providian's balance sheet might fall below the minimum ratios
demanded of banking regulators, opening the door to a government
takeover, Park said.</TE>
<TE>   As of Sept. 30, the company's capital ratio remained well above
the minimum threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect Providian to post a fourth-quarter loss of 5 cents
a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Management didn't
project Providian's results in Thursday's announcement.</TE>

<LD>Americans cut back on spending a bit in December as free-financing
offers for cars and other incentives began to wane. But incomes rose
for the first time in four months, putting consumers in a better
position to spend in the months ahead, economists said.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said consumer spending dropped 0.2% in
December. That followed a revised 0.3% decline in November, a much
smaller decrease than previously reported.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Americans' incomes, which include wages,
interest and government benefits, rose by 0.4% in December after
being flat the month before.</LD>
<TE>   With income growth outpacing spending, the nation's personal
savings rate--savings as a percentage of after-tax income--rose to 1%
in December from 0.5% the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment
benefits last week rose by a seasonally adjusted 30,000 to 390,000
following three straight weeks of declines.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service said it won't challenge a $10.4-million
court victory by Rite Aid Corp. in July, opening the door for
companies that want to claim a tax deduction for selling affiliates
at a loss.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said it won't pursue the Rite Aid case to the U.S.
Supreme Court on the advice of the U.S. solicitor general. That keeps
intact an appeals court ruling that the agency overstepped its bounds
in drafting rules prohibiting companies from deducting losses when a
subsidiary is sold.</LD>
<LD>   In deciding against pursuing the case against Rite Aid, the
third-largest U.S. drugstore chain, the IRS in effect accepted a
federal appeals court's ruling that the tax agency went too far in
drafting regulations mandated by Congress in the 1990s. Those
regulations were intended to prevent tax shelters in which companies
tried to create artificial losses.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In another embarrassing quality glitch for Ford Motor Co., the auto
maker said it ordered dealers Monday to stop selling many of its 2002
model Ranger pickup trucks because of a problem with the rear axle.</LD>
<LD>   The order affected 804 Rangers on dealer lots with manual
transmissions and the new FX4 design package, which gives the
vehicles a rugged, off-road look.</LD>
<LD>   An additional 374 of the pickups, which already are in customer
hands, will be recalled by Ford, company officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The problem stems from a bad differential casting, they said,
adding that it could be fixed only by replacing the entire rear-axle
assembly.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft to Pay States in Antitrust Settlement</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. is paying about $10 million to reimburse the legal
bills of nine states that have settled the antitrust case against the
software giant, according to interviews with state representatives.</LD>
<LD>   Other states that opted to continue pursuing the case rather than
settle will have to wait for reimbursement until they end their
effort to win more stringent penalties against Microsoft.</LD>
<LD>   Under federal law, a company found liable for antitrust
violations, such as Microsoft, must reimburse taxpayers for the cost
of the prosecution. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly
ordered Microsoft to pay the nine states last week. The checks
starting arriving this week.</LD>
<TE>   The law applies only to the states, said Justice Department
spokeswoman Gina Talamona.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government will not be reimbursed. In 1999, the
Justice Department disclosed that it had spent about $7 million
investigating Microsoft in the case.</TE>

<HD>Amgen Gets FDA Approval for Drug</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc. won Food and Drug Administration approval of a
longer-acting version of Neupogen, its $1-billion blockbuster
chemotherapy drug.</LD>
<LD>   Neupogen is used daily during chemotherapy to prevent a drop in
infection-fighting white blood cells. The new form, to be sold as
Neulasta, can be taken once during a chemotherapy cycle, which is
typically three to four weeks, the company said. Neulasta is designed
to prevent infection as well as treat it.</LD>
<LD>   The new medicine's volume allows the drug to circulate longer in
the bloodstream before being removed by the kidneys. A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons Inc. analyst Craig West said the medicine, also called
pegfilgrastin, may give a modest boost to Neupogen sales. Neupogen
had $1.3 billion in sales in 2001, according to Amgen.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Thousand Oaks-based Amgen rose 46 cents to close at
$55.50 on Nasdaq, before the news was announced.</TE>

<HD>Viacom Truce Met With Skepticism</HD>
<DH>Media: Many company execs, money managers say
Redstone-Karmazin dispute will ignite again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after Viacom Inc.'s board of directors ordered Chief Executive
Sumner Redstone and second-in-command Mel Karmazin to reconcile their
differences and work as a team, many company executives and money
managers doubted the truce would hold.</LD>
<LD>   One source close to the company predicted that "Sumner will bite
his thumb off in frustration" if he has to watch from the sidelines
as Karmazin continues to run the company's daily operations.</LD>
<LD>   "It might be resolved for the short term, but [the dispute] is
going to rear its ugly head again," said Richard Rubinstein, senior
vice president at the Oppenheimer Funds, which owns Viacom shares.</LD>
<TE>   He said Viacom's stock would take a temporary hit if Karmazin
steps down when his contract expires at the end of next year or if
Redstone assumes more power, as the company's bylaws allow him to do
in May 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Karmazin, formerly chief executive of CBS Corp., gained operating
control of Viacom in May 2000, when the two companies merged.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts were disappointed that the board didn't take a more
dramatic step to signal support of Karmazin.</TE>
<TE>   "There would have been a bigger sigh of relief if Mel's contract
was extended for two more years," said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone, 78, lost round one in his apparent battle to regain
operating control of Viacom on Wednesday when the independent
directors, after a discussion of the management conflict, instructed
Karmazin to fulfill the remaining two years of his employment
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real test of Karmazin's leadership abilities. The
question is whether he has the self-discipline and can contain his
own ambitions for the greater good of the company and his own
career," said Stephen Unger, a managing partner at Heidick &amp;
Struggles, an executive recruiting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Many Wall Street money managers blame Redstone for provoking a
fight with Karmazin and creating investor uncertainty by telling the
media he would not designate Karmazin, 58, as his successor by naming
him CEO next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Sumner is like a lot of these media moguls," said Scott Black,
founder of Delphi Management Inc., a large Viacom shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   "He thinks he's going to live forever. You have the same problem
at News Corp. and Disney, where these large personalities have a hard
time sharing power."</TE>
<TE>   Although Karmazin is beloved on Wall Street, the clash of egos
with Redstone has created rivalries within Viacom's media empire,
with executives at CBS and Paramount Pictures choosing sides.</TE>
<TE>   Separately on Thursday, Viacom Entertainment Group Chairman
Jonathan Dolgen was given the additional responsibility of Viacom's
huge Simon &amp; Schuster publishing division, which formerly reported to
Karmazin.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Newcomb had been the publishing house's CEO but is
leaving to join private equity firm Leeds Weld &amp; Co.</TE>

<HD>Walter Hewlett Explains Stance</HD>
<DH>Deals: HP director says many large investors also oppose
Compaq merger. He disputes firm's accusations against him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Dissident Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett said he had met
with more than 30 of the company's 50 largest investors and found
widespread opposition to HP's planned acquisition of Compaq Computer
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "The clear impression I have is that the people we talk to don't
like the merger," said Hewlett, who is trying to muster enough
shareholder votes to kill the $25-billion all-stock deal. "We were
uniformly well-received."</LD>
<LD>   In his first round of on-the-record interviews since declaring his
opposition to the biggest technology merger in history, the
57-year-old philanthropist disputed several of HP's claims in the
ongoing battle for shareholder votes.</LD>
<TE>   For example, he challenged HP director George Keyworth's assertion
last week that Hewlett had refused to engage in substantive
conversations with the board about his opposition to the Compaq
takeover.</TE>
<TE>   "The board knew all along that I had grave reservations, and I
expressed them at each point when all of this was discussed," said
Hewlett, whose father co-founded the Palo Alto computer and printer
maker. "All of this is a smoke screen."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about HP's contention that he had never worked at HP,
Hewlett confirmed that in addition to serving on the board since
1987, he had worked full time at the company for three summers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is incorrect," he said of HP's statement. Hewlett said he
hadn't asked HP to correct the record because the debate on his
background is a "diversion" from the issue of whether the merger is
good or bad for HP investors. "I really understand HP and the
business it's in," Hewlett said.</TE>
<TE>   On the underlying dispute, he reiterated that major technology
mergers routinely fall short of management projections. Recent
securities filings by Hewlett cite the sliding profit at
Houston-based Compaq after it swallowed Digital Equipment Corp. and
Tandem Computers.</TE>
<TE>   "HP can do much better on its own," Hewlett said. "The net present
value of HP stock is going to go down $5," he said, even if
everything goes right after the merger.</TE>
<TE>   HP spokeswoman Rebecca Robboy offered modest disagreement. "We
have a different view of the facts," she said. "We've been meeting
with investors. We have a very good sense of their level of support."</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett's family foundation has about half its endowment tied up
in more than 100 million HP shares, worth more than $2.2 billion
based on Thursday's close of $22.11 a share.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the charity was not necessarily more risk-averse than
the average investor, as HP has suggested.</TE>
<TE>   HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina and the company's other directors
say the union with Compaq would save billions of dollars through the
elimination of competing product lines, give HP critical mass in the
services business and better enable the company to compete against
IBM Corp. in the market for big server computers.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett and many Wall Street analysts disagree, saying that the
company would lose some customers as it tries to force them toward
the surviving lines of machines.</TE>
<TE>   And they say HP's profitable printing business would be weighed
down by Compaq's exposure to the difficult personal-computer market.</TE>
<TE>   Challenged by HP to spell out a competing plan for HP to increase
earnings, Hewlett said he favored smaller, more targeted acquisitions
as a starting point. "Plenty of alternatives exist," he said. "The
board should direct the management to explore them."</TE>
<TE>   In other HP-Compaq news Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * The European Commission gave unconditional antitrust approval to
the deal, removing a barrier to completing the transaction, which
analysts said gives a boost to Fiorina's effort to overcome
opposition led by Hewlett.</TE>
<TE>   * HP cut total compensation for top executives last fiscal year.
Fiorina earned $1 million in salary with no bonus in fiscal 2001,
down from salary and bonus totaling $2.77 million in 2000. Fiorina
also was granted $1.17 million in options and other compensation,
down from $2.07 million in such awards in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   * Compaq cut total compensation for top executives last year as
the computer maker's turnaround stalled. CEO Michael D. Capellas
earned $1.6 million in salary with no bonus in 2001, down from salary
and bonus totaling $5.04 million in 2000. Capellas also was granted
$2.1 million in loan forgiveness and other compensation but no
restricted stock awards, contrasted with $24.4 million in such awards
last year.</TE>

<DH>Remembrance: Dozens gather to remember the 88 who died when
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 plunged into the sea two years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forever linked by the loss of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 off the Port
Hueneme coast, dozens of friends and relatives of those who died
marked the crash's second anniversary Thursday with prayers, tributes
and the dedication of a permanent memorial site.</LD>
<LD>   More than 70 people, most from the Seattle area and some from as
far away as Fargo, N.D., made what many called "the pilgrimage" to
Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   "My children will someday come down here, and this is how they
will get to know who my sister was," said 27-year-old Matthew Penna,
whose sister Deborah died when the MD-83 jetliner traveling from
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco went down eight miles
offshore. Five crew members and 83 passengers died.</LD>
<TE>   "I personally feel obligated to be here, and I gain strength from
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Penna made the trip from Seattle with his parents for the series
of events that started with an 11 a.m. memorial Mass at St.
Maximilian Kolbe Church in Westlake Village and was followed by a
picnic and graveside service.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's turnout was much smaller than last year's event, which
drew more than 850 people and was mostly paid for by the airline.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the relatives expressed frustration at the pace of the
legal proceedings and investigation by the National Transportation
Safety Board. Investigators believe the crash was caused by the
failure of the mechanism that controlled the plane's horizontal
stabilizer--the winglike projections on an aircraft's tail that help
control the up-and-down pitch of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of wrongful death lawsuits are pending, though more than 20
cases have been settled.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's events concluded on a Port Hueneme beach, where family
members expect to create a permanent memorial by next year.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives and friends were joined at the beachfront ceremony by
Ventura County officials and rescue workers, some of whom were among
the first on the water looking for survivors.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all just horrible," said Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd
Class Eric Beach of Simi Valley. "It was the worst thing I have
experienced in my life. You don't forget about something like this."</TE>
<TE>   James "Bud" Bottoms, the Santa Barbara artist commissioned to
create a memorial to those who died--a 20-foot-wide bronze sundial
attached to swimming dolphins--choked back tears as he talked of his
inspiration for the artwork.</TE>
<TE>   "Dolphins are the life spirit of the sea, and they lighten my
heart," he told the nearly 200 people who gathered at the beach.
"This project has renewed my spirit, and I hope it will bring joy to
your lives."</TE>
<TE>   With a Coast Guard boat nearby, family members then formed a large
circle, lighted candles of remembrance and listened as the victims'
names were read.</TE>
<TE>   Several in the group held hands and walked barefoot to the shore
to toss red roses into the surf at 4:22 p.m., the time the plane
crashed.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like half of me has been stopped," said Desirae Donaldson,
whose brother Monte, 29, a landscaper and disc jockey in Seattle,
died in the crash with his fiance, Colleen Whorley.</TE>
<TE>   "One minute they are here and the next minute they are gone, but
it gives me a bit of healing to be back here."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, about 60 family members attended the private
memorial Mass in Westlake Village. Msgr. Peter O'Reilly spoke of a
parallel between the crash and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we learned on Sept. 11 is that we are all
linked together," he said. "We mourn with your pain, but it is our
hope that death is not the end."</TE>
<TE>   A picnic at Oak Canyon Community Park followed the service. After
the meal, a motorcade proceeded to Pierce Bros. Valley Oaks Memorial
Park in Westlake Village for a graveside ceremony at the top of a
hill where the remains of people never identified are buried.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Busche said he is still dealing with the loss of his son Ryan,
28, and daughter-in-law Abigail, 25.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never get over this, but I have made a lot of friends from
this crash," said Busche, a resident of Olympia, Wash. "But I am a
bottom line kind of person, and we just want to know what really
happened that day."</TE>

<HD>Film School Debuts in Ventura</HD>
<DH>Photography: Brooks Institute opens 70,000-square-foot
facility on the Avenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With sprawling sound stages, elaborate movie sets and a hands-on
curriculum, the Brooks Institute of Photography officially opened its
new film school in Ventura on Thursday, attracting more than 300
officials and industry professionals to its west side campus.</LD>
<LD>   The 70,000-square-foot facility, which will serve 200 students
from all over the world, offers everything from screenwriting to
movie production to digital animation, school officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "The philosophy here is can-do," said Glynn Beard, the school's
program director for film and video production. "You roll up your
sleeves and get your hands dirty, and then you do it all over again.
We take students through every aspect of filmmaking."</LD>
<TE>   Local officials and artists say the school--10 times larger than
the Brooks Institute's old film school in Santa Barbara--may not
generate huge economic dividends for Ventura, but it will help
revitalize Ventura Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, they say, it will garner national prestige and
artistic recognition for the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is very catalytic," Ventura Mayor Ray Di Guilio said.
"Schools themselves don't generate a lot of money, but they create an
environment of economic stimulation. We heard loud and clear today
that they want to weave this school into our community. I am very
excited about the possibilities over the next five years or so."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Granata, who runs an art education program called Focus on
the Masters, is a graduate of the Brooks Institute of Photography.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have people imported into our community, businesses will
have to serve the student population," she said. "It will revitalize
the area and make our community more visually
recognizable--especially when you have a bunch of film students
photographing a community."</TE>
<TE>   School President John Calman said the new facility dwarfs the
school's former, 7,000-square-foot film studios. He hopes to expand
Brooks' film student population to at least 500.</TE>
<TE>   "Brooks is redefining its mission," he told the crowd gathered
inside a cavernous sound stage. "It has always been known as a
photography institute, but the film school has been its best-kept
secret."</TE>
<TE>   The new campus occupies the former Santa Ventura Studios, near oil
fields and vacant lots along an industrial patch of North Ventura
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   In 1875, the site was home to Canada Larga school, which later
became Mill School. Santa Ventura Studios opened in 1997 and shot
television shows, including "Mike Hammer" and the short-lived "Air
America." Parts of "Erin Brockovich" were also filmed at the studios.</TE>
<TE>   Those sets remain, along with a 28,000-square-foot sound stage,
billed as one of the largest in Southern California. The previous
owners also left behind a bonanza of equipment--thousands of cameras,
lights, cables, cords, props and outlets.</TE>
<TE>   One room is stacked to the ceiling with odds and ends from various
movies and television shows. There are barstools, Mayan head
carvings, African walking sticks, plastic flowers and an old crate of
liquor bottles.</TE>
<TE>   In another room are boxes of small video cameras, old-style
hand-cranked cameras and 16-millimeter cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "We quadrupled our holdings, and now we can offer opportunities
for students that are rare for any film school," said David Litschel,
academic dean of the institute.</TE>
<TE>   He said there are bigger and better-known film schools, such as
USC's, but all students at Brooks get to make a movie and all begin
using equipment the first year of their three-year course of study.
Tuition is $17,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Students come from as far as Indonesia, Japan and Korea. Only a
few hail from Ventura County, Litschel said, in part because the
school has not yet been marketed locally.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's grand opening, Jeff Perry, an actor and co-founder
of Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company, pronounced the facilities
"the best studios outside of Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   "Brooks is taking a bold and visionary step," Perry said. "It is
making a commitment it can back up with the facilities to join the
ranks of top film schools here and around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Students also praised the curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "Most film schools keep you off the equipment until your junior
year, but this place gets you going right away," said 23-year-old
Seamus Phillips of Northampton, Mass., sitting in an editing room
finishing up a documentary project.</TE>
<TE>   There are no student dormitories, but the school works with local
real estate agents to help students find housing.</TE>
<TE>   The Brooks Institute is well known for its school of photography,
which has four campuses in Santa Barbara and Montecito. It opened the
film school on State Street in Santa Barbara in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Alumni of the institute include Robert Legato, whose
special-effects team won an Oscar for its work on "Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   He was also visual-effects supervisor for "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone."</TE>
<TE>   The campus is a collection of low-slung, cream-colored buildings
with red tiled roofs. There are classrooms, recording studios,
animation facilities and a swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   Although the grand opening was Thursday, students have been
attending classes for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   During the opening ceremonies, Calman stressed how much he wants
the school to become part of life in Ventura County. He urged
residents to drop by and see what the film institute is all about.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Steve Bennett said Calman was likely to
get his wish.</TE>
<TE>   "You will find that the citizens here will bend over backward to
welcome you and to welcome you to become part of the community,"
Bennett said.</TE>

<HD>Drivers Relieved by New, Wide 55</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Six miles of the northern Costa Mesa Freeway are
widened and an interchange retooled in a three-year, $118-million
project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overcoming construction delays and unexpected engineering problems,
Caltrans on Thursday completed a $118-million project to rebuild and
widen the northern six miles of the Costa Mesa Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The roadwork includes a redesigned connection from the Garden
Grove Freeway to the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway that eliminates a
notorious stretch where traffic merged at the Chapman Avenue offramp
in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   "I used to dread that drive up the 55 to the 91," said Rob Silva,
who took the rebuilt highway for the first time on Thursday to get to
work in Santa Ana. "I think it is going to work out fine."</LD>
<TE>   Caltrans, which began construction on the northern section in
January 1999, widened the Costa Mesa Freeway from eight to 10
lanes--adding one lane in each direction--between the Garden Grove
and Riverside freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Entrances and exits were enlarged to at least two lanes and in
some areas to three, such as at Katella Avenue. Overpasses and
underpasses for city streets also were widened.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, roughly 210,000 motorists travel that part of the Costa
Mesa Freeway, which, combined with the Riverside Freeway, is one of
the main arteries between Orange County and the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   "The congestion that was there no longer exists," said Arshad
Rashedi, a senior engineer for Caltrans who worked on the project.</TE>
<TE>   At the interchange of the Garden Grove and Costa Mesa freeways,
the northbound Chapman Avenue offramp was separated from the
northbound entrance to the Costa Mesa Freeway. Caltrans officials say
problems caused by motorists trying to get on and off the freeway at
the same place should be greatly reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The eastbound interchange had been regarded as one of the county's
worst, with traffic often slowing to 25 mph or less during morning
and evening rush hours. Engineers predict the new ramps should allow
normal cruising speeds of 55 to 60 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it would take me 20 minutes just to transition to the
55 and get to Katella," said Frank Beels of Orange, who owns a gas-
and welding-supply company in Huntington Beach. "The project is worth
that change alone."</TE>
<TE>   Beels estimated that the improvements to the Costa Mesa Freeway
have reduced his rush-hour trips about 10 minutes each way.</TE>
<TE>   The project, however, was not without its problems. During
construction, motorists complained that the detours and ramp closures
caused grinding traffic jams and severe congestion on surrounding
city streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really frustrating for a while," said Silva, who manages
Sid's Tattoo Parlor, one of many businesses along the freeway. . "I'd
get off work to drive home and the ramps to the highway would all be
closed."</TE>
<TE>   The completion dates for several parts of the project--including
the $20.5-million interchange of the Garden Grove and Costa Mesa
freeways--were repeatedly delayed, prompting the Orange County
Transportation Authority to pressure Caltrans to get the project back
on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor and OCTA board member Todd Spitzer said he and
authority officials went to Caltrans last fall when it looked like
the work would not be finished on time. "The project was not
progressing as promised by Caltrans and we tried to get their
attention," said Spitzer, whose district includes the northern Costa
Mesa Freeway. . "These are our tax dollars at work. Well, where was
the work?"</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans blamed the delays on a series of unfortunate and
unforeseen circumstances, such as the electricity crisis, which
stymied the production of asphalt, and unusually rocky terrain that
slowed the installation of pilings.</TE>
<TE>   "We basically finished on time and on budget," said Rashedi. "But
during construction, some of our milestones were delayed. There were
utility problems and we had to redesign some of the bridges because
of unexpected subsurface boulders."</TE>
<TE>   The state provided $92 million for the project, while OCTA
allocated about $21 million from Measure M, the county's half-cent
sales tax for transportation projects. The city of Orange contributed
$5 million for work at Katella Avenue and overpasses at La Veta and
Meats avenues.</TE>

<HD>2 Women Suspected of Illegal Marketing in Pitch to Seniors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After an undercover fraud investigation, two saleswomen have been
arrested on suspicion of illegally marketing magnetic mattress pads
to sick and elderly consumers in Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests of Phyllis Hall, 51, and Nancy Milliken, 36, came
moments after the women finished separate sales pitches last month
touting the devices as a remedy for ailments ranging from heart
disease to impotence.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the state Department of Health Services nor the federal
Food and Drug Administration has given magnetic mattress pads
marketing approval.</LD>
<TE>   Hall, an Orange County resident, was arrested Monday after
speaking before two dozen Simi Valley seniors on the claimed benefits
of mattress pads produced by Tennessee-based Magnetic Ideas Inc.</TE>
<TE>   An investigator from the Los Angeles County Department of Consumer
Affairs had previously warned Hall her sales pitches were illegal,
Ventura County Chief Deputy Investigator Vinse Gilliam said.</TE>
<TE>   Before her presentation, Hall asked whether any of the attendees
represented government agencies, Gilliam said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing no response, she assured the crowd that magnetic pads
could help treat ailments such as arthritis, diabetes, asthma, heart
disease and impotence, Gilliam said.</TE>
<TE>   Hall was taken into custody following the conclusion of her
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Milliken, a Los Angeles resident, was arrested last month after
she gave a presentation in Simi Valley about magnetic mattress pads
produced by Florida-based European Health Concepts Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Milliken also described her company's product as an effective
remedy for various health disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators purchased a mattress pad from Milliken for $1,076
before placing her under arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Hall and Milliken are each accused of violating state health and
safety codes.</TE>
<TE>   Hall is scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 26, and Milliken on Feb.
19.</TE>

<HD>Evidence Planted, Defense Suggests</HD>
<DH>Court: Attorneys for date-rape suspect Andrew Luster allege
misconduct. Prosecutors rebut the accusations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for date-rape suspect Andrew Luster are raising allegations
of police and prosecutorial misconduct, suggesting Ventura County
authorities planted evidence and conspired to set up their wealthy
client.</LD>
<LD>   "There is something going on in Ventura that is bizarre and we are
going to get to the bottom of it," attorney Roger Jon Diamond said.</LD>
<LD>   After a court hearing Thursday, Diamond told reporters he will
push to remove county prosecutors from the case and seek dismissal of
the rape charges.</LD>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Wold said the misconduct allegation
is false.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not a shred of truth to back it up," Wold said,
suggesting defense attorneys were merely stalling to avoid trial.
"It's baseless, it's ludicrous and it's desperate."</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the 38-year-old great-grandson of cosmetics mogul Max
Factor, is accused of sexually assaulting three women after allegedly
rendering them unconscious with a date-rape drug known as gamma
hydroxybutrate, or GHB. He was arrested in July 2000 after one of the
women reported being raped.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said investigators later found videotapes of
encounters with two other women during a search of Luster's Mussel
Shoals beach house, where Luster has been held under house arrest for
more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   No trial date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have filed several motions, including one that
seeks to suppress the videotapes on grounds investigators seized
evidence outside the scope of a search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was supposed to be argued Thursday before Ventura County
Superior Court Judge Ken Riley.</TE>
<TE>   But Diamond and co-counsel Richard G. Sherman put the brakes on
the proceeding, telling Riley that prosecutors have withheld crime
scene photos the defense needs before going forward with the motion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are really stuck on the motion for suppression until
we get those photographs," Sherman argued.</TE>
<TE>   Wold objected to more delays, telling Riley, "It is the people's
position that the defendant is trying to drag this out as long as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   But Riley agreed to give the defense more time. He set a Feb. 21
hearing at which time lawyers are expected to set a firm schedule on
motions and a possible trial date.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Sherman denied trying to delay the case. He
blamed the slow pace on prosecutors who, he says, have failed to turn
over more than 160 items of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The defense contends law enforcement officials planted evidence,
altered tapes and filed false declarations to obtain an unprecedented
$10-million bail for their client. An appellate court later reversed
bail and set the amount at $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond said police and prosecutors moved too quickly and did not
properly investigate the claims of the alleged victims before filing

<TE>   "And when they make a commitment, they get their egos involved and
they don't look into exculpatory evidence," Diamond said.</TE>

<HD>Financier, Five Others Indicted in Ponzi Scheme</HD>
<DH>Courts: A 78-year-old Laguna Niguel man is among those held
in $17-million fraud case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard A. Parker, the Laguna Niguel financier who once offered to
fund construction of the world's tallest building, has been indicted
by a federal grand jury along with his son and four other colleagues
after investigators accused them of wire and mail fraud, money
laundering and conspiracy.</LD>
<LD>   Federal agents on Thursday arrested four officers of Parker's
firm--Morgan, Weinstein &amp; Co.-- and issued warrants for a Canadian
resident they claim participated in a long-running and sophisticated
Ponzi scheme. Parker, 78, was arrested by agents last week when they
heard he was considering leaving for Europe. All remained in custody
Thursday, according to the U.S. attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   In papers filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, authorities
claim the group bilked more than a dozen firms worldwide out of $17
million. In all, the indictment includes 33 counts of illegal
activity. Among the victims listed are development, airline, hotel,
shipping and computer firms.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities say Parker's firm promised to loan the corporations
more than $11 billion. The company didn't deliver the loans but
collected retainer fees.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators allege the borrowers were enticed by claims that
Morgan, Weinstein held more than $30 billion in assets--claims that
authorities say are false.</TE>
<TE>   The six indicted are:</TE>
<TE>   Parker, the chairman of Morgan, Weinstein &amp; Co.; Richard A. Parker
II, 54, of San Juan Capistrano, president of Morgan, Weinstein; David
A. Feldman, 62, of Fallbrook, a senior analyst; Donald L. Allen, 44,
of San Diego, an analyst; Daisy M. Burlingame, 60, of Grass Valley, a
new projects manager; and Wayne Chan, 51, of Vancouver, British
Columbia, who allegedly acted as a reference for Morgan, Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Parker's family say the elder Parker and his son are innocent. Jan
L. Handzlik, Feldman's lawyer, said his client denies the charges.
Other lawyers could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, a borrower was typically required to
pay 1% of the loan amount as a retainer but frequently didn't get it
back.</TE>

<HD>Grief Links the Survivors of Flight 261 Crash Victims</HD>
<DH>Anniversary: Dozens gather in Ventura County to remember
the 88 who died when their Alaska Airlines jet plunged into the sea
two years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forever linked by the loss of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 off the Port
Hueneme coast, dozens of friends and relatives of those who died
marked the crash's second anniversary Thursday with prayers, tributes
and the dedication of a permanent memorial site.</LD>
<LD>   More than 70 people, most from the Seattle area and some from as
far away as Fargo, N.D., made what many called "the pilgrimage" to
Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   "My children will someday come down here, and this is how they
will get to know who my sister was," said 27-year-old Matthew Penna,
whose sister Deborah died when the MD-83 jetliner traveling from
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco went down eight miles
offshore. Five crew members and 83 passengers died.</LD>
<TE>   "I personally feel obligated to be here, and I gain strength from
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Penna made the trip from Seattle with his parents for the series
of events that started with an 11 a.m. memorial Mass at St.
Maximilian Kolbe Church in Westlake Village and was followed by a
picnic and graveside service.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's turnout was much smaller than last year's event, which
drew more than 850 people and was mostly paid for by the airline.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the relatives expressed frustration at the pace of the
legal proceedings and investigation by the National Transportation
Safety Board. Investigators believe the crash was caused by the
failure of the mechanism that controlled the plane's horizontal
stabilizer--the winglike projections on an aircraft's tail which help
control the up-and-down pitch of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of wrongful death lawsuits are pending, though more than 20
cases have been settled.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's events concluded on a Port Hueneme beach, where family
members expect to create a permanent memorial by next year.</TE>
<TE>   With a Coast Guard search-and-rescue boat nearby, family members
then formed a large circle, lighted candles of remembrance and
listened as the victims' names were read.</TE>
<TE>   Several in the group held hands and walked barefoot to the shore
to toss red roses into the surf at about 4:22 p.m., the time the
plane crashed.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like half of me has been stopped," said Desirae Donaldson,
an independent filmmaker whose brother Monte, 29, a landscaper and
underground disc jockey in Seattle, died in the crash with his
fiance, Colleen Whorley.</TE>
<TE>   "One minute they are here and the next minute they are gone, but
it gives me a bit of healing to be back here."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, about 60 family members attended a private
memorial Mass in Westlake Village. Msgr. Peter O'Reilly spoke of a
parallel between the crash and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we learned on Sept. 11 is that we are all
linked together," he said. "We mourn with your pain, but it is our
hope that death is not the end."</TE>
<TE>   A picnic at Oak Canyon Community Park followed the service. After
the meal, a motorcade proceeded to Pierce Bros. Valley Oaks Memorial
Park in Westlake Village for a graveside ceremony at the top of a
hill where the remains of people never identified are buried.</TE>

<HD>Impasse Ends on Energy Bonds</HD>
<DH>Finances: Regulators and state officials clear way to raise
$13.4 billion to help ease budget shortfall. But Wall Street reserves
judgment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>After four months of deadlock, utility regulators and state officials
struck a deal Thursday intended to allow California to float as much
as $13.4 billion in energy-related bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials struggling with a
serious budget shortfall welcomed the proposed agreement, saying they
hope it allows them to quickly restore money to be spent on schools
and hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   But Wall Street, which is crucial to California's plan, reserved
judgment pending closer scrutiny. Consumer advocates criticized the
deal, saying it short-circuits public oversight of electricity rates
and does nothing to amend the state's dozens of relatively expensive
long-term power contracts.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed agreement between the Public Utilities Commission and
the state Department of Water Resources faces a vote Feb. 21 at the
commission, where it is expected to pass. It would earmark money from
the monthly electricity bills of 12 million utility customers for the
next decade to pay off as much as $13.4 billion in bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Money from the bonds would be used to reimburse the state, which
spent $6.5 billion for electricity dating to last January and then
borrowed $4.2 billion more in June. It was last January when soaring
wholesale electricity prices drained Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric of the cash needed to
buy electricity for their customers.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement does not specify rate increases. But it shifts
control of future rate increases from the commission, California's
historic regulator of rates, to the fledgling power-buying unit of
the Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   The precise electric rates under the deal would depend on the
final size of the bond offer and the state's electricity costs.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Agencies Will Scrutinize Deal</TE>
<TE>   There's no guarantee that Thursday's agreement will lead to a bond
sale. Credit agencies on Wall Street, which scrutinize such deals to
be sure that bondholders will be assured of getting paid back, were
wary.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to go through this with a legal fine-tooth
comb," said David Hitchcock, director of the local and state
government group of Standard &amp; Poor's, a credit rating agency.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph S. Fichera, chief executive officer of Saber Partners, who
until recently served as an energy advisor to Davis, said lenders
will be studying the agreement for "certainty of cash flow and that
the political battles ... would never be able to undermine the timely
payments of the bonds."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to comment further on the agreement until he could
examine it more thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities commission President Loretta Lynch said she was
confident that the rate agreement would allow California to win an
investment-grade rating for its bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think this structure works," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, shortly after the governor thrust the Department
of Water Resources into the emergency job of buying electricity to
avoid wide-scale blackouts, Davis also urged it to sign dozens of
long-term power contracts in order to avoid buying electricity in the
dysfunctional, exorbitant spot market that had been created under a
1996 deregulation plan.</TE>
<TE>   For many months, the bond deal has been stalled by the politics of
those long-term power contracts. In October, the utilities commission
voted 4 to 1 to reject Davis' plan for paying back the bonds. Lynch
argued that the governor's plan would prevent the state from
renegotiating the $43 billion worth of power contracts signed by the
Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch preferred a plan that would separate repayment of bonds from
payment of the long-term contracts and free the state to renegotiate
those contracts. Wholesale electricity prices in the West crashed in
June to roughly one-tenth the prices prevailing when the contracts
were signed.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch negotiated for months with Davis administration officials on
a compromise bond repayment plan.</TE>
<TE>   At her urging, Department of Water Resources officials began
meeting again with several power suppliers, such as Calpine and
Sempra Energy, to renegotiate long-term contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure Mounts to OK Repayment Plan</TE>
<TE>   But so far, those talks have yielded no amended contracts. And
with each round of bad news about the state's dwindling revenue
projections, pressure has mounted on the utilities commission to
approve a bond repayment plan.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds cannot be sold without such an agreement, and without bonds
or some other way of paying back the $6.5 billion, legislators would
have to make even more severe cuts in the state's roughly
$100-billion budget.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal announced Thursday, the utilities commission would
be forced to raise utility rates within 120 days of being notified by
the Department of Water Resources that it needed more money to make
payments on bonds or cover its electricity costs.</TE>
<TE>   Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, a
San Francisco consumer group, complained of the lack of utilities
commission oversight, saying that the needs of Wall Street were
driving California policy.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said it appears utility rates will not have to be increased
this year, given how much wholesale power prices have dropped.</TE>
<TE>   But that could change, Lynch said, if the Department of Water
Resources' costs of buying electricity rises or if the utilities,
which are expected to resume the job of buying electricity for their
customers in 2003, do not hold down costs.</TE>
<TE>   Some accused Lynch of abandoning her efforts to reform the state's
long-term power contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "We had expected that there would be some kind of iron fist to pry
open the long-term contracts," Hoge said.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead this is a kid glove to go hand in hand with [the
Department of Water Resources] to the same place we were before."</TE>
<TE>   But Lynch said since she began urging renegotiation of the power
deals, the governor, attorney general and other state officials have
come to agree that the state should seek cheaper electricity.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have a unified approach," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Ronan, a Calpine senior vice president, said the utilities
commission and the Department of Water Resources agreement will not
snuff out his company's willingness to discuss amending contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this changes at all our position," he said.</TE>

<HD>Boyd Got $104,000 While He Voted</HD>
<DH>Probe: D.A.'s documents show the Seal Beach councilman's
dealings over a trailer park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seal Beach Councilman Shawn Boyd received nearly $104,000 in
undisclosed payments from the owner of a trailer park, even as he
voted to use city-backed bonds to underwrite the sale of the park to
a nonprofit group, according to documents filed by the district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd didn't reveal his relationship to park owner Richard Hall,
for whom he began working in late 1999, to his colleagues or on
required state financial forms.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd also didn't disclose on the forms, which he filed under
penalty of perjury, that he had received money from Hall in 2000 and
2001.</LD>
<TE>   The financial relationship between Boyd and Hall was detailed in
court documents filed Wednesday by the Orange County district
attorney's office. The office opened an investigation in October into
possible conflict-of-interest violations by the councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd, up for reelection in March, didn't return calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hall made a profit of more than $4 million on the sale of the Seal
Beach Trailer Park, which he bought in December 1998 for $2.9
million. He sold it in December 2000 for $7.45 million to a nonprofit
group, using $6.4 million in city-backed revenue bonds and a
$1-million state grant. The park has provided the city's only
designated affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   District attorney investigators served search warrants Wednesday
on Boyd's home and an apartment where he has been staying in recent
months. Investigators seized financial and business documents, and
two computers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are continuing to vigorously pursue this investigation,"
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Pete Pierce said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times in September, Boyd said he had
followed state conflict-of-interest laws in his dealings with Hall.
He said he didn't tell his colleagues, even in closed sessions, about
his work for Hall because he feared it would be used against him
politically.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview Thursday, Hall said he told Boyd shortly
after they began working together that Boyd couldn't have anything to
do with the Seal Beach transaction.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no conspiracy to hide anything," Hall said. "I asked
Shawn if he was cool [working on other land deals]. He said he was
bulletproof."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Boyd received $123,800 in payments from Hall that
continued through last month, according to the court documents. The
portion of that over $104,000 is from periods outside the time of
Boyd's questioned votes.</TE>
<TE>   State law bars elected officials who have received $500 or more
from voting or influencing decisions for 12 months on matters that
could financially benefit the giver. That covers money paid or
formally promised.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd, 33, listed "no reportable sources of income or loans"
greater than $10,000 on his state financial forms for 2000 and 2001.
He told The Times in September that he had received no money from
Hall and was living on savings.</TE>
<TE>   During that interview, Boyd said he expected that Hall would
eventually pay him $12,000 for a mobile-home park project in Castaic
and $4,000 more for an aborted apartment project in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been able to put anything together," Boyd said in
September. "Nobody makes any money until the deal closes."</TE>
<TE>   But canceled checks filed with the court show that Boyd received
about $54,000 from Hall's RHC Communities Inc. between June 2000 and
January 2001. The money was listed as consulting fees, government
relations work and expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Hall paid Boyd an additional $65,000 between June 2000 and
December 2001 through payments to consultant David Ellis of Newport
Beach, according to canceled checks and invoices from Boyd's company,
Boyd Perkins. Hall paid $4,000 a month to Ellis, of which $3,000 was
then paid to Boyd, plus expenses, Hall said and records show.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no comment," Ellis said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $65,000 in indirect monthly payments, $15,000 fell outside
the period of Boyd's questionable votes. The remaining $50,000, plus
the $54,000 paid directly to Boyd, equals the $104,000 at issue.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $4,800 payment from RHC Communities was made to Boyd
Perkins in September 2001. Hall said that check was for Boyd's work
on the Anaheim apartment project.</TE>
<TE>   After the first check was cashed in June 2000, Boyd voted four
times as a council member and twice as a member of the city's
redevelopment agency on matters involving the mobile-home park and
its sale. The vote completing the sale was on June 25, 2001. The
first vote was Jan. 10, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd abstained on three other council votes involving the sale. A
videotape of one of the meetings shows Boyd acted not because of his
relationship with Hall but because he said he was involved in similar
real-estate transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd was elected to the council in 1998 after being endorsed by
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). He is facing three
challengers in March: retired accountant Walt Miller, county planner
Charles Antos and relocation specialist Beverly Pearce.</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach resident Laura Brecht, who filed complaints against
Boyd with Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas and the state Fair Political
Practices Commission, said voters should "have their eyes opened" to
Boyd's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   She and other residents said Boyd argued for the sale of the park
in community and council meetings. He acknowledged in September that
he'd told Hall that several million dollars in city money was
available to cover the purchase price--information that residents
said inflated the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Hall denied that allegation, saying he based his sale price solely
on an appraisal.</TE>

<HD>3 Years + 2 Lanes = Less Stress for 55 Freeway Trips</HD>
<DH>Traffic: A $118-million widening of six miles of the
northern Costa Mesa highway and a retooled interchange with the
Garden Grove bring relief to commuters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overcoming construction delays and unexpected engineering problems,
Caltrans on Thursday completed a $118-million project to rebuild and
widen the northern six miles of the Costa Mesa Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The roadwork includes a redesigned connection from the Garden
Grove Freeway to the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway that eliminates a
notorious stretch where traffic merged at the Chapman Avenue offramp
in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   "I used to dread that drive up the 55 to the 91," said Rob Silva,
who took the rebuilt highway for the first time Thursday to get to
work in Santa Ana. "I think it is going to work out fine."</LD>
<TE>   Caltrans, which began construction on the northern section in
January 1999, widened the Costa Mesa Freeway from eight to 10
lanes--adding one lane in each direction--between the Garden Grove
and Riverside freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Entrances and exits were enlarged to at least two lanes and in
some areas to three, such as at Katella Avenue. Overpasses and
underpasses for city streets also were widened.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, roughly 210,000 motorists travel that part of the Costa
Mesa Freeway, which, combined with the Riverside Freeway, is one of
the main arteries between Orange County and the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   "The congestion that was there no longer exists," said Arshad
Rashedi, a senior engineer for Caltrans who worked on the project.</TE>
<TE>   At the interchange of the Garden Grove and Costa Mesa freeways,
the northbound Chapman Avenue offramp was separated from the
northbound entrance to the Costa Mesa Freeway. Caltrans officials say
problems caused by motorists trying to get on and off the freeway at
the same place should be greatly reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The eastbound interchange had been regarded as one of the county's
worst, with traffic often slowing to 25 mph or less during morning
and evening rush hours. Engineers predict the new ramps should allow
normal cruising speeds of 55 to 60 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it would take me 20 minutes just to transition to the
55 and get to Katella," said Frank Beels of Orange, who owns a gas-
and welding-supply company in Huntington Beach. "The project is worth
that change alone."</TE>
<TE>   Beels estimated that the improvements to the Costa Mesa Freeway
have reduced his rush-hour trips by about 10 minutes each way.</TE>
<TE>   The project, however, was not without its problems. During
construction, motorists complained that the detours and ramp closures
caused grinding traffic jams.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really frustrating for a while," said Silva, who manages
Sid's Tattoo Parlor, one of many businesses along the freeway. "I'd
get off work to drive home and the ramps to the highway would all be
closed."</TE>
<TE>   The completion dates for several parts of the project--including
the $20.5-million interchange of the Garden Grove and Costa Mesa
freeways--were repeatedly delayed, prompting the Orange County
Transportation Authority to pressure Caltrans to get the project back
on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor and OCTA board member Todd Spitzer said he and
authority officials went to Caltrans last fall when it looked like
the work would not be on time.</TE>
<TE>   "The project was not progressing as promised by Caltrans and we
tried to get their attention," said Spitzer, whose district includes
the northern Costa Mesa Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans blamed the delays on a series of unfortunate and
unforeseen circumstances, such as the electricity crisis, which
stymied the production of asphalt, and unusually rocky terrain that
slowed the installation of pilings.</TE>
<TE>   "We basically finished on time and on budget," said Rashedi. "But
during construction, some of our milestones were delayed."</TE>

<HD>Southland Muslims Take a PR Approach</HD>
<DH>Advertising: Billboard campaign emphasizes shared values to
promote good relations and counter negative images after Sept. 11
attacks, its sponsors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new advertising campaign aimed at promoting good relations between
Muslims and their neighbors will be unveiled today on billboards in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Two billboards in Los Angeles County and one in Orange County will
show a diverse group of smiling Muslims above the slogan, "'Even a
smile is Charity'--a message from your Muslim neighbor." Two
additional billboards are scheduled to be put up in San Bernardino
County next week.</LD>
<LD>   The $15,000-a-month campaign, funded by the Southern California
chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is designed to
counteract the negative images of Islam and Muslims since the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to let others know we're not different than one another,"
executive director Hussam Ayloush said. "We have the same values."</TE>
<TE>   Ayloush said his organization is using Southern California to test
the potential for a national billboard campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to gauge the reaction of people," said Ayloush, who
solicited donations for the campaign from the Southern California
Islamic community.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't go on with this project without the financial support
from the Muslim community or the moral support from the larger
community."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign will change monthly or every other month, depending
on donations. Other planned slogans include "Family is life, life is
family," "Kindness is a mark of faith" and "A nice thought is an act
of worship."</TE>
<TE>   The themes are taken from the Koran, Islam's holy book, or the
words of the prophet Muhammad, although they remain uncredited on the
billboards.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully this can help, even in a small way, to bridge the gap
between the Muslim community and the broader Southern California
community," said Bill Shane, executive director of the Orange County
chapter of the National Conference for Community and Justice, an
organization that promotes interfaith understanding.</TE>
<TE>   The billboards are located on the Santa Ana Freeway near Garfield
Avenue in Commerce and on West Century Boulevard near Aviation
Boulevard in Los Angeles and on the Costa Mesa Freeway near Edinger
Avenue in Orange County.</TE>

<LD>The former president of a high school booster club was sentenced
Wednesday to 120 days in jail for stealing money from a school
athletics fund and a youth baseball team.</LD>
<LD>   Melissa Kucera pleaded guilty to stealing more than $75,000 from
the Woodbridge High athletic booster club--about two years' worth of
revenue--and $7,500 from the Thundercats baseball team. Both charges
were felonies.</LD>
<LD>   Kucera, who could have faced nearly five years in prison, has
repaid $61,776 to the booster club and fully repaid the Thundercats,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Nancy C. Du Point said.</LD>
<TE>   "Since restitution was made upfront, she was given a more lenient
sentence," Du Point said.</TE>
<TE>   Kucera was placed on five years' probation and ordered not to seek
employment or volunteer work with any nonprofit or school
organization during that time.</TE>

<HD>Garofalo Money Incident to Spark Change in Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau will
meet next week to consider strict new check-writing policies proposed
in the wake of a near-scandal involving former Mayor Dave Garofalo.</LD>
<LD>   "When we work with a group of volunteers involved in promoting
travel and tourism ... we would have a policy to [control] ... their
finances," bureau President Doug Traub said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The policy overhaul was ordered by the board last month after
disclosures that Garofalo, who resigned in December before pleading
guilty to one felony and 15 misdemeanor conflict-of-interest charges,
had transferred $11,500 from a bureau account into one of his own.
The money was eventually returned, after repeated requests by the
bureau and its threat to seek embezzlement charges, according to
Traub.</LD>
<TE>   Bureau officials said Thursday they considered the incident a
wake-up call. "When you're dealing with a loose group of volunteers,"
Traub said, " they may feel like they can spend money without
bringing in receipts; this will make it clear from the very beginning
that that's not how we operate."</TE>
<TE>   New rules would add a paper trail and ban signing blank checks.</TE>
<TE>   Reached late Thursday, Garofalo denied wrongdoing, saying he had
put the money in a separate account simply to avoid mixing it with
bureau funds. "I felt the only right thing to do was ... develop some
consensus on where the money should go," he said, adding that the
money was eventually distributed the way the donor wished.</TE>

<LD>He has serious things on his mind, but you'd never know it. Even when
you press Bigira Kiro-Kiro about how rough the last couple of months
must have been, you get nothing but a smile.</LD>
<LD>   Some people are just made that way.</LD>
<LD>   We're talking in Kiro-Kiro's shop, the African Corner, which sits
in the middle of a nondescript row of little stores on Newport
Boulevard in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<TE>   The shop has been shut down for two months, the result of a fire
in a store upstairs that caused water damage to Kiro-Kiro's. He ought
to be upset about that, but to a guy who decided he could make a go
of it in Orange County by opening a store called the African Corner,
it'll take more than a fire to discourage him.</TE>
<TE>   And that something happened earlier this month in Congo, a place
about as far away from Newport Boulevard as you can get.</TE>
<TE>   It's the country Kiro-Kiro, 51, lived in for 19 years before
leaving in 1991, when it was known as Zaire. It's the country that
borders his homeland of Burundi and where he still has several
relatives and scores of old friends.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Kiro-Kiro had a couple of shops and employed 17 people
in Goma, a city on Congo's eastern edge. Residents knew that nearby
Mt. Nyiragongo was volcanic and could erupt sometime, but no one
could imagine the devastation that ensued when it did blow two weeks
ago, slicing Goma in half and leaving countless people dead or
homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The first call Kiro-Kiro got was from his sister-in-law. Her
family was safe, but all she could save from the home was a cell
phone. Kiro-Kiro also learned his boyhood home had been demolished by
the river of lava.</TE>
<TE>   From this great distance away in America, Kiro-Kiro says he wants
to help. He's collecting donated food and clothing for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Only an earthquake could approximate the kind of damage here that
Goma--a city of 800,000--has seen. Knowing that, I ask Kiro-Kiro how
he and people there are reacting to the devastation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sad and shocked," he says, "but people there are used to
fighting and killing. So, this was kind of a relieved shock."</TE>
<TE>   Relieved shock?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," he says. "This time, there was nobody to blame."</TE>
<TE>   Will the townspeople be demoralized? He smiles and says no.</TE>
<TE>   "In Africa, we live day to day. We go shopping every day, we get
groceries every day, water every day. So, the volcano was not an
issue, like, 'It was coming today, it will come tomorrow.' Nobody is
busy chasing a volcano there, they're busy chasing daily life."</TE>
<TE>   Americans don't live like that, of course. We don't know what it's
like to live in a war-torn country where you shop every day because
you don't have either the money or the refrigerator to buy a week's
worth of food.</TE>
<TE>   So, why is this man smiling?</TE>
<TE>   "People in Africa are full of life," he says. "They accept things.
This has happened. Now, what is next?"</TE>
<TE>   I ask Kiro-Kiro if he still considers Congo his home.</TE>
<TE>   "The way Orange County has accepted me, this is home," he says.
"When I told friends I wanted to open a shop here, they said, 'Are
you crazy? L.A., New York, Atlanta, San Diego, anywhere, but not
Orange County.'"</TE>
<TE>   That was a reaction to the county's small African American
population and the perception that a dreadlocked man selling African
artifacts might have better luck elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Kiro-Kiro smiles about the decent living he's making and
the fact that "95% of my business is white."</TE>
<TE>   The store is set to reopen next week. Kiro-Kiro says any relief
goods people donate will be delivered to humanitarian organizations.</TE>
<TE>   I understand why, when it comes to his own business, Kiro-Kiro
isn't unhappy. "I feel like a multibillionaire compared to what they
have in Africa," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but how can he not weep over the plight of the Congolese.</TE>
<TE>   "Soon, they'll be planting roses again," he says. "Life will be
happy again."</TE>

<LD>Two saleswomen have been arrested on suspicion of illegally marketing
magnetic mattress pads to sick and elderly consumers in Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests of Phyllis Hall, 51, of Orange County, and Nancy
Milliken, 36, of Los Angeles came moments after the women finished
separate sales pitches last month touting the devices as a remedy for
ailments ranging from heart disease to impotence.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the state Department of Health Services nor the federal
Food and Drug Administration has given magnetic mattress pads
marketing approval.</LD>
<TE>   Hall and Milliken are accused of violating state health and safety
codes. Hall is scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 26, and Milliken on
Feb. 19.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Visits Valley to Promote City Unity</HD>
<DH>Politics: Mayor takes his anti-secession message to
Chatsworth. The effort has raised $30,000 so far.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn's hoped-for $5-million campaign to fight the
breakup of Los Angeles has raised $30,000 so far, records show.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters said they have tapped government contractors and
expressed confidence they will meet the $5-million goal set for his
anti-secession campaign committee.</LD>
<LD>   The largest contribution listed was $25,000 from HNTB Corp., which
worked at Los Angeles International Airport for the city and on the
Blue Line for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The firm
currently shares an MTA contract to study the Alameda Corridor
project.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn's anti-secession committee received $5,000 from the public
relations firm Fleishman-Hillard Inc., which has a $5-million
contract with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also received $25,000 from the public relations firm
Winner and Associates of Encino. But Hahn returned the money after
The Times reported that the firm sought a one-year extension of a
city contract to promote the expansion of LAX, even though the
expansion had been put on hold.</TE>
<TE>   The company's president, Charles Winner, withdrew from the
contract after reports he had held three fund-raisers for Hahn's 2001
mayoral campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The Winner money was returned by the anti-secession committee, "to
avoid even the appearance of a conflict," said Kam Kuwata, a
political consultant for the anti-secession committee, called L.A.
United.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
it was inappropriate for Hahn to be asking government contractors for
contributions to an anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn filed papers to form L.A. United on Nov. 15. The contribution
report released Thursday covers the period ending Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Some potential donors are probably waiting for a decision in April
from the Local Agency Formation Commission about whether cityhood
proposals for the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the harbor area
will be put on the November ballot, said Larry Levine, co-founder of
a separate anti-secession organization called One Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not on the ballot, so people aren't motivated," Levine said.
His group has raised about $4,500 so far.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has stepped up his appearances in areas seeking to break
away, in part to persuade voters that the city is improving service
and that staying together is best for all of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he toured a solar power business in Chatsworth, ate
lunch with constituents at Brent's Deli in Northridge and presented
an award at a Knights of Columbus meeting in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   He capped the day by announcing the deployment of traffic officers
to guide rush-hour traffic through five busy intersections along
Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks and Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Valley VOTE representatives testified at a hearing
Thursday that any environmental impact report on the secession
proposal should be limited in scope.</TE>
<TE>   A study done for LAFCO found that the breakup may significantly
harm the environment in terms of water and power supplies, sewage
treatment and cuts to police and fire services.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, LAFCO has agreed to go ahead with an environmental
impact report to determine whether any negative effects can be
mitigated.</TE>

<LD>   Pair Plead Guilty in Software Theft Ring</LD>
<LD>   Two key players in a prominent cyberspace gang, known as</LD>
<TE>   DrinkorDie, pleaded guilty Thursday in Los Angeles federal court
to criminal charges of copyright infringement.</TE>
<TE>   Kentaga Kartadinata, 30, of Los Angeles and Mike Nguyen, 26, of
West Los Angeles agreed to cooperate with the U.S. Customs Service in
an investigation targeting members of the so-called Warez cyberspace
gang around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Christopher Johnson said in court that
indictments are expected soon against at least 50 other DrinkorDie
members.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of a plea agreement, Kartadinata and Nguyen each face
27 to 33 months in prison. They are free on bail pending sentencing a
year from now.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen, a computer programmer at UCLA, managed several of the
group's file servers containing thousands of pirated software titles.</TE>

<TE>   School Chief's Raises at Ex-District Contested</TE>
<TE>   The New Mexico attorney general Thursday charged current and
former school board members in Las Cruces with illegally granting
raises and benefits to Compton Supt. Jesse Gonzales when he headed
the schools there.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales, who was not charged with anything, was superintendent in
Las Cruces for nearly 12 years before leaving late last year to
assume the top job in Compton. Through a spokesman, he declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a previous interview and in documents submitted to The Times, a
lawyer for Gonzales said the board was responsible for approving
raises and that Gonzales had accepted them "in good faith" as
gestures recognizing his "excellent work."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales' accomplishments in Las Cruces were cited by California
education officials when they decided to return full local authority
to Compton's schools last year after eight years of state management.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal complaints involve misdemeanor violations of New
Mexico's Open Meetings Act. They charge two current board members and
three former members with approving hundreds of thousands of dollars
in extra benefits for Gonzales without making the votes public.</TE>

<TE>   An employee who threatened to blow up the Chevron oil refinery in
El Segundo if the company refused to pay him as much as $3 million to
settle his disability claims was found guilty of extortion Thursday
by a federal jury in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors said Ronald Denton, 38, who worked at the
refinery for 14 years, had been placed on disability leave after
complaining of stress stemming from his failure to get a promotion.</TE>
<TE>   While on leave, he told a psychologist he intended to blow up the
facility if the firm refused to meet his financial demands, the U.S.
attorney's office said. Denton, who remains in custody, is scheduled
to be sentenced May 2.</TE>

<TE>   Melvin Farmer, who formed an antiviolence organization, pleaded
not guilty at the Inglewood Courthouse on Tuesday. Sheriff's deputies

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Mexico attorney general Thursday charged current and former
school board members in Las Cruces with illegally granting raises and
benefits to Compton Supt. Jesse Gonzales when he headed the schools
there.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzales, who was not charged with anything, was superintendent in
Las Cruces for nearly 12 years before leaving late last year to
assume the top job in Compton. Through a spokesman, he declined to
comment.</LD>
<LD>   In a previous interview and in documents submitted to The Times, a
lawyer for Gonzales said the board was responsible for approving
raises and that Gonzales had accepted them "in good faith" as
gestures recognizing his "excellent work."</LD>
<TE>   Gonzales' accomplishments in Las Cruces were cited by California
education officials when they decided to return full local authority
to Compton's schools last year after eight years of state management.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal complaints involve misdemeanor violations of New
Mexico's Open Meetings Act. They charge two current board members and
three former members with approving hundreds of thousands of dollars
in extra benefits for Gonzales without making the votes public.</TE>

<HD>For Swedish Olympians, This Is Winter Training</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Snowboard team pursues R&amp;R in the surf and sand
of Laguna Niguel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dude, the name Stefan Isaksson isn't, like, on Huntington Beach's
Surfing Walk of Fame. But give the Swede credit.</LD>
<LD>   Isaksson, head coach of the Swedish Olympic snowboard team,
borrowed a page from California's laid-back school of thought. With
only a week or so till the opening ceremonies in Salt Lake City, he
brought the team to sunny Orange County for a little R &amp; R.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been out working hard since August," Isaksson explained
while sitting poolside at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel. "We
needed to get out ... away ... to have some fun."</LD>
<TE>   Way cool.</TE>
<TE>   They chose the hotel because the coach had heard from a friend of
a friend that it had a great gym where the team could work out, had
palm trees for environmental happiness and was close to Salt Creek
beach, one of the area's better surfing breaks.</TE>
<TE>   And, since snowboarding is akin to skateboarding which is like
surfing, voila! It wasn't hard to make the leap of reason. After all,
the team needed a break. The six team members would force themselves
to enjoy the heated pool and Jacuzzi and try surfing in the nearby
Pacific Ocean, all for Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Isaksson did, however, take some flack from Sweden's skiing and
snowboarding establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "At home, they kept telling me, 'Why aren't you at high altitude
with the team training?'" he said. "I'm the coach and I need to keep
them working hard and yet happy. They need to have some fun."</TE>
<TE>   He said he knew the team would enjoy surfing and the beach.
"They're going to feel relaxed and a bit spoiled, enjoying good food
and the luxurious environment. That's what I think will make them win
the Olympic gold."</TE>
<TE>   Is he a Kahuna or what?</TE>
<TE>   Forget that Southern California is in the middle of a deep freeze,
with chilly, frost-bitten nights. Dude, that's what room thermostats
are for. Hello?</TE>
<TE>   Team member Anna Hellman, 23--who, at 5-foot-9, is one of those
tall, naturally blond Nordic beauties you hear about--says she
worships the sun. In her country, where summers are short, the
daytime temperature this week in the northern areas was minus 4
degrees Fahrenheit.</TE>
<TE>   So cold that when it snows at night and then rains, there's only
ice on the slopes the next day. That's why they love California,
especially training at Mammoth Mountain in Northern California, where
they enjoyed powdered snow conditions thanks to a recent storm.</TE>
<TE>   "Your weather here, is actually like our summer in Sweden,"
Hellman said.</TE>
<TE>   She grew up snowboarding but says it takes a back seat to downhill
skiing and cross-country skiing in terms of popularity in Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, at least in the United States, there exists a
generation gap that plays out at mountain resorts where old school
downhill skiers turn their noses up at the younger, wilder snowboard
nation.</TE>
<TE>   "But in Sweden, it's getting more popular and more interesting
because television is starting to carry more snowboarding events,"
Hellman said.</TE>
<TE>   During a poolside lunch at their hotel, the team chowed down on
club sandwiches, French fries and sodas.</TE>
<TE>   But what did they really want? Swedish meatballs, they yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, back home, Swedish meatball recipes are as plentiful
as frozen burritos are here at the local gas-station mart.</TE>
<TE>   "At home, we eat mostly Swedish meatballs and maybe a little
pasta," Markus Jonsson said. "That's one of the things you look
forward to, is Mom's homemade food because we travel a lot. And when
you travel, you always eat a lot of fried foods."</TE>
<TE>   The team had tasted fast-food cuisine on previous snowboarding
trips. "Sweden has gotten Americanized, and we have plenty of
California food like tacos, burritos and enchiladas," one team member
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jonsson and his teammate and sister, Janet, 24, come from a small
mountain village, population 150. Breakfasts consist of hearty foods
such as porridge, not U.S.-style three-egg breakfasts loaded with
bacon and sausages. "We eat healthier there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   They marvel at such large urban centers as Los Angeles and San
Francisco. Stockholm is large, said Janet Jonsson, "but we don't have
anything like you do here with all these homes upon homes."</TE>
<TE>   Added her brother: "We live in a remote area. My dad hunts for
moose and we even eat reindeer sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   After lunch, and to help them succeed with their full cultural
immersion, three members of the team donned wetsuits and tried
surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Markus Jonsson, Magnus Sterner, 23, and Stefan Karlsson, 20,
lugged the bulky, 8-foot beginner surfboards supplied by a local surf
shop under their arms as they waded excitedly into the surf. (The
team's medal hopes are pinned on Sterner, last year's World Cup
winner, but the team is not considered a shoo-in for the gold in Salt
Lake City.)</TE>
<TE>   They bobbed like corks for what seemed a long time, waiting for
the right wave. But since they were beginners, they either would
stroke too soon or had trouble turning the board around.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, one was a goofy and two stood regular--surf lingo
for standing with either your left (regular) or right (goofy) foot
forward--though what they did couldn't really be called "standing
up."</TE>
<TE>   Several times they paddled hard when a large wave broke in front
of them, but as they grabbed the rails and tried to stand, the
board's nose would sink, pitching them off unmercifully.</TE>
<TE>   Although the water temperatures were in the mid- to high-50s, the
Swedes--accustomed to the frigid Baltic Sea--thought it was quite
warm.</TE>
<TE>   And what did the Salt Creek local rippers think?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good vibe," said Ian Calderon, 16, who surfs for nearby
Capistrano Valley High School team. "It shows they're up for new
things. It's cool they want to try."</TE>

<LD>After an undercover fraud investigation, two saleswomen have been
arrested on suspicion of illegally marketing magnetic mattress pads
to sick and elderly consumers in Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests of Phyllis Hall, 51, and Nancy Milliken, 36, came
moments after the women finished separate sales pitches last month
touting the devices as a remedy for ailments ranging from heart
disease to impotence.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the state Department of Health Services nor the federal
Food and Drug Administration has given magnetic mattress pads
marketing approval.</LD>
<TE>   Hall, an Orange County resident, was arrested Monday after
speaking before two dozen Simi Valley seniors on the claimed benefits
of mattress pads produced by Tennessee-based Magnetic Ideas Inc.</TE>
<TE>   An investigator from the Los Angeles County Department of Consumer
Affairs had previously warned Hall her sales pitches were illegal,
Ventura County Chief Deputy Investigator Vinse Gilliam said.</TE>

<LD>The New Mexico attorney general Thursday charged current and former
school board members in Las Cruces with illegally granting raises and
benefits to Compton Superintendent Jesse Gonzales when he headed the
schools there.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzales, who was not charged with anything, was superintendent in
Las Cruces for nearly 12 years before leaving late last year to
assume the top job in Compton. He declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   In a previous interview and in documents submitted to The Times, a
lawyer for Gonzales said that the board was responsible for approving
raises and that Gonzales had accepted them "in good faith" as
gestures recognizing his "excellent work."</LD>

<HD>Unlicensed Abortion Clinic Closed</HD>
<DH>Health: The owner is under investigation by county
officials, who say he charged $200 for the procedure and catered to
uninsured women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health and law enforcement officials shut down what they called an
unlicensed abortion clinic in West Hollywood, and are investigating
whether the owner practiced medicine without a license.</LD>
<LD>   Edgar Ruiz, 42, charged $200 in cash for abortions and catered to
uninsured women, according to sheriff's and county health department
officials. Ruiz told authorities he is licensed in his native
Nicaragua, but does not hold a medical license in this country.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Opferman, of the Health Authority Law
Enforcement Task Force, said Ruiz's clinic drew "women wanting
something cheap and discreet, something that wouldn't leave a paper
trail."</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz told investigators that he has run Centro Medico Para La
Mujer for four years in a medical building on Santa Monica Boulevard
near the Hollywood Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Officials learned of the facility, which they say was not licensed
as a health clinic, after a patient complained to county Supervisor
Gloria Molina's office Nov. 30 that the doctor had performed an
incorrect procedure.</TE>
<TE>   The woman's sister suspected the clinic was not licensed. Molina
alerted the Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   An undercover sheriff's deputy then visited the clinic posing as a
patient, and Ruiz allegedly offered to perform a pelvic exam on her.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested Ruiz on Tuesday, seized hundreds of patient
files and padlocked the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   His bail was set at $1 million. Investigators asked the district
attorney's office to file felony charges against Ruiz, alleging that
he practiced medicine without a license with the risk of great bodily
injury.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that an abortion is, by nature, a dangerous procedure,
Opferman said.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors declined to file felony charges Thursday
afternoon, saying investigators had not presented enough evidence to
support them and had not had time to go through the files seized.</TE>
<TE>   Because the law requires arrestees to be arraigned or released
within 48 hours, Ruiz was scheduled to be released.</TE>
<TE>   "None of those [patient] files have been looked at," said Sandi
Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of work needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators acknowledged that Ruiz paid a licensed physician to
attend at least some of the abortions at the clinic, working with
Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   That was the experience of the only alleged victim authorities
have identified so far, a woman who was at the clinic for a follow-up
visit when investigators arrived with search and arrest warrants,
according to Opferman and deputy health officer Don Ashton.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the task force will seek patients identified in
Ruiz's files to gather more evidence.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who held a news conference
Thursday morning to announce Ruiz's arrest, said he was concerned
that Ruiz will leave the country.</TE>
<TE>   Opferman and Ashton said they were concerned that Ruiz might open
another abortion clinic somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities asked anyone treated by Ruiz to call (800) 427-8700.
To report an illegal clinic, call the county health department at
(213) 989-7039.</TE>

<HD>Man Held in 1970 Death of Infant</HD>
<DH>Crimes: Detective, who wasn't even born when the killing
occurred, reopened case because it involved a young child.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The father of a Los Angeles infant who died in 1970 has been arrested
on suspicion of murder and is in custody in Albuquerque, police said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Roy Montoya wore "an expression on his face that was a little
surprised and shocked" when officers went to interview him last week,
said LAPD Det. Chris Merlo, who, with his partner, Det. Dan Garcia,
reopened the case a few months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Police suspect that Montoya beat his son to death before fleeing
California. One-year-old Jeffrey Leroy Montoya died at Harbor General
Hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Montoya, who police believe is in his 50s, was found as part of a
push by the Los Angeles Police Department to solve more old cases,
also known as "cold cases," often by using improved technology.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the department established the citywide Cold Case
Homicide Unit. It is reviewing all unsolved homicides to see if they
can be solved.</TE>
<TE>   At the Harbor Division, where a separate, less formal effort has
been underway, 63% fewer homicides last year than in 2000 allowed
detectives more time for the older cases.</TE>
<TE>   Merlo said that as he and Garcia began sorting through the Harbor
Division's old files, the Montoya case jumped out.</TE>
<TE>   "It was particularly catching to both my partner and me, I guess
because we both have little kids," Merlo said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Montoya had been brought by his parents to Harbor General
with bruises. They said he had fallen. But by the time a coroner's
report was issued contradicting their account--the death was found to
be a homicide--both parents had left the state, Capt. Andrew Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   Using databases not available 32 years ago, Merlo and Garcia found
the parents, now divorced, in Albuquerque.</TE>
<TE>   After interviewing them, they asked local police to make an
arrest. Montoya was apprehended at his home Jan. 24.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to be extradited to California.</TE>
<TE>   Merlo said the boy's mother, who was not arrested and does not
face charges, helped detectives find Montoya.</TE>
<TE>   Merlo, 31, who was not born when Jeffrey Montoya died, said old
cases can be difficult, but time can also be an investigator's
friend.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," he said, "people are more cooperative after years of
guilt or discomfort."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the mother, "32 years of thinking about it
certainly helped."</TE>

<HD>Finding Strength in Their Faith</HD>
<DH>Accident: A day after a car plows into a crowd, students
and teachers at Christian school pray and find things to be thankful
for.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sanctuary of Eagle Rock Baptist Church is where the families of
Westminster Academy Christian Day School typically meet for chapel
prayers, for the school's "Patriotic Day" celebration, for
eighth-grade graduation.</LD>
<LD>   But Thursday morning, hundreds of parents, students and young
alumni quietly gathered in the dimly lighted church to pray and sing
from their hardback hymnals for the wounded among them--the 13
students and teachers taken to the hospital after being struck
Wednesday by a gray Mercedes in a parking lot accident during
after-school pickup.</LD>
<LD>   In an instant, bodies were pinned beneath a car as children
screamed and adults ran to the rescue. A team of visiting basketball
players from Arcadia Christian School and several adults lifted the
car off the victims while others pulled them out.</LD>
<TE>   "As soon as I saw the bodies, I was sure there were fatalities
around there somewhere," Principal David Thibault told the 500
gathered in the chapel. "But God's protection has never been made
more clear to me in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Only four students and the music teacher from this Christian
school remained hospitalized Thursday. Teacher Jan Hanson, who was
pinned beneath the car, suffered three fractured ribs, a shattered
pelvis and a severe cut on her leg and is being treated at County-USC
Medical Center. Two boys are being treated at Childrens Hospital. A
6-year-old underwent surgery Thursday to repair two broken femurs. A
9-year-old is in serious condition, suffering from a badly bruised
left lung and a collapsed right lung, along with several broken ribs.</TE>
<TE>   Two other children, a 10-year-old boy with a fractured left leg
and an 8-year-old boy in fair condition with unspecified injuries,
are being treated at County-USC.</TE>
<TE>   Others were recovering at home from scrapes, bruises and
fractures.</TE>
<TE>   "We can rejoice in God's grace that none of them are in critical
condition and none of them are expected to suffer long term,"
Thibault said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the 1978 Mercedes, Kae Hak In, 65, of Glendale was
picking up her granddaughter, a second-grader, about 3 p.m. when she
accelerated into the crowd, police said. She probably will not be
cited, said Sgt. John Pasquariello, a police spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigation has found no indication there was any criminal
intent on her part," Pasquariello said. "But we have not determined
what caused the accident."</TE>
<TE>   Thibault and the crowd prayed for the driver. "What happened was
an accident, it was not the direct result of the sin of the driver,"
the principal said.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents and students arriving at the Colorado Boulevard
campus Thursday morning were overcome with emotion, crying and
hugging each other, as they met with teachers and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so scared, I'm so scared," said one mother, crying into the
shoulder of first-grade teacher Jan Quintelier. "I just love you so
much."</TE>
<TE>   This is a school of modest cinder-block buildings but strong
faith. Thursday's gathering was called "a service of rejoicing"
because no lives were lost, and Thibault sounded as much like a
pastor as a principal.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen the power of God who does things we do not
understand," Thibault said. "But instead of asking why, we need to
ask, what results can come even in the midst of trouble?"</TE>
<TE>   He joked that the seventh-graders didn't have to take their
feudalism test Thursday. Then, more seriously, he began building on a
theme:</TE>
<TE>   "In the midst of our heartache, in the midst of our trouble, we
find the strength of others," he said, slipping into prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord, we don't like trouble and wish it didn't occur, but we can
say you are a great God and you know what is best."</TE>
<TE>   This is just the kind of religious teaching that envelops every
classroom and lesson at Westminster Academy, whose mission includes
leading "pupils to receive Christ as Savior and Lord."</TE>
<TE>   A stable faculty of 22 teaches 220 students from kindergarten
through eighth grade, leaning heavily on Bible teachings.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1953, Westminster teaches creationism, not Darwinism,
and in the school's early years it had to undertake a wide search to
find a science textbook in sync with those beliefs. Thanks to the
popularity of fundamentalist Christian schools and home-schooling
among Christians, plenty of texts were found, said school board Vice
President Laurel Martin.</TE>
<TE>   The school was started by parents who attended Calvary
Presbyterian Church in Glendale and felt that public schools were not
teaching Christian values. Nearly 50 years later, parents send their
children to Westminster for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the Bible as the foundation for teaching our children in
this school," said Edwin Quiles, 43, who has sent his three children
to Westminster. "We agree with the school's philosophy of teaching
respect for authority and respect for the hierarchy of the family."</TE>
<TE>   Westminster is not a tony school for wealthy families. Tuition,
about $3,500 a year with after-school care available for $2 an hour,
is well below most independent schools' price tags, and it does not
cover the cost of educating the students.</TE>
<TE>   The school makes up the difference by counting pennies and holding
fund-raisers throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   The community favorite is the annual nut sale--thousands of pounds
of almonds, pistachios and walnuts. Last year, playground equipment
was bought with the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the families today are Asian or Latino and many of the
parents are immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   While many private schools refuse to disclose their test scores to
outsiders, Westminster proudly shared its students' performance.</TE>
<TE>   On the Stanford 9 test, administered in California public schools
and other schools around the country, Westminster students typically
score better than about 75% of other students who took the test.</TE>
<TE>   While this school community is shaken by the accident, its members
confronted the tragedy in the way they do most things at Westminster:
turning to the word of God, reading the 46th Psalm to open their
service:</TE>
<TE>   "God is our refuge and our strength.... Be still and know that God
is with us ... "</TE>

<HD>Study Links Smog, Sports to Asthma</HD>
<DH>Health: Children who engage in strenuous exercise in
polluted cities triple their risk of developing breathing problems,
USC research finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Children who live in smoggy cities and play strenuous sports are
three times more likely to develop asthma than kids breathing cleaner
air, according to a new study of 3,500 children by USC and government
researchers.</LD>
<LD>   The study is the first to show smog can cause the sickness in
otherwise healthy kids. About 5 million children suffer from asthma
nationwide, and its prevalence has increased dramatically in recent
years. Smog is one of several suspected causes of the problem, but a
cause-and-effect link has proven elusive until now.</LD>
<LD>   "We've known for some time that smog can trigger attacks in
asthmatics. This study has shown that ozone [the main component of
smog] can cause asthma as well," said Alan C. Lloyd, chairman of the
state Air Resources Board, which sponsored the study. "This
illustrates the need not to retreat but to continue pushing forward
in our efforts to strengthen air pollution regulations."</LD>
<TE>   Although the study focuses on 13 cities in California, the
researchers say the results suggest young people in such ozone hot
spots as Houston, Atlanta and Phoenix may face similar risks.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are part of an $18-million, decade-long children's
health study at USC. Previous studies have found that smog causes
bronchitis in children, increases school absenteeism and results in
decreased lung function.</TE>
<TE>   Results of the study will be published Saturday in Lancet, a
British scientific journal. Researchers from USC, the state air board
and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
participated in the research.</TE>
<TE>   Even as health experts encourage children to exercise more to
promote well-being, the scientists involved in the study found that
increased exertion on smoggy days can lead to the onset of a
long-term condition that sometimes proves life-threatening.
Researchers emphasize that kids need to stay fit, but parents and
coaches need to be more mindful of air pollution levels.</TE>
<TE>   "Exercise is really healthy for children and children should be
encouraged to play team sports, but on days when air pollution levels
are expected to be high, children should limit prolonged outdoor
exertion," said Dr. Rob McConnell, the study's lead author and
associate professor of preventive medicine at the USC Keck School of
Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Ishida, executive director of the California Interscholastic
Federation, said she will refer the study to the organization's
health and safety committee for review. The federation, which
oversees athletic programs involving 661,000 high school students,
routinely advises school districts to avoid games and practices
during hot days, but not when it's smoggy.</TE>
<TE>   "It troubles me. If it is a health and safety issue for our
athletes, we certainly need to look into it," Ishida said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the study offers some assurance for parents and children. Only
kids who participated in three or more strenuous sports, including
football, swimming and basketball, were most at risk. They made up
just 8% of the children in the study. Whites and Hispanics, boys, and
youths of both sexes from middle- or upper-income families were most
likely to play multiple sports.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the researchers found that the risk of illness is greater
in smoggy cities in inland valleys downwind of city cars, trucks and
factories, they saw little or no effect in towns with little or no
air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Pollution levels across much of California have declined since the
fieldwork for the study was completed four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists tracked 3,535 fourth-, seventh- and 10th- graders in
seven smoggy communities--Lake Arrowhead, Mira Loma, Riverside,
Upland, Glendora, San Dimas and Alpine--and six with cleaner
air--Atascadero, Santa Maria, Lompoc, Lancaster, Long Beach and Lake
Elsinore--from 1993 to 1998. None of the children had a history of
asthma, respiratory disease, wheezing, chest injuries or surgery.
Scientists took into account each child's socioeconomic status,
history of allergies and family history of asthma. By the end of the
study, researchers had identified 265 new cases of asthma, mainly in
the smoggy cities. Across all communities, children who played three
or more sports were 80% more likely to develop asthma, and children
in the smoggy cities who participated in multiple sports were 330%
more likely to develop the ailment.</TE>
<TE>   Ozone, created in abundance when emissions mix with sunlight, was
most clearly implicated as the cause. It scars lung tissue, leads to
shortness of breath, and can cause permanent loss of lung function
and trigger asthmatic attacks. California has higher concentrations
of the pollutant spread over a wider area than any other state.</TE>
<TE>   Though the study indicates ozone can cause asthma, scientists say
other factors play a role as well. Other studies have blamed latex in
tires, socioeconomic status and cockroach droppings as possible
causes. About 15 million Americans suffer chronic inflammation of the
airways, or asthma, 50% more than 20 years ago.</TE>

<LD>An employee who threatened to blow up the Chevron oil refinery in El
Segundo if the company refused to pay him as much as $3 million to
settle his disability claims was found guilty of extortion Thursday
by a federal jury in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors said Ronald Denton, 38, who worked at the
refinery for 14 years, had been placed on disability leave after
complaining of stress stemming from his failure to get a promotion.</LD>
<LD>   While on leave, he told a psychologist he intended to blow up the
facility if the firm refused to meet his financial demands, the U.S.
attorney's office said. Denton was arrested after he urged the
psychologist to report the threats to Chevron, according to
prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   A search of Denton's home turned up books on how to manufacture
explosives, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Denton, who remains in custody, is scheduled to be sentenced May
2.</TE>

<HD>Add Staff to Ease Backup at Mexican Border, Panel Told</HD>
<DH>San Diego: Stepped-up security is effective but extra hours
are taking a toll, area officials say. But Customs chief says ports,
entry from Canada most need added resources.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Stricter safeguards have made the U.S.-Mexico border safer since
Sept. 11, but the federal government will have to spend more for new
inspectors and facilities to ease traffic jams, U.S. border officials
said at a congressional hearing here Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Customs Service Commissioner Robert C. Bonner, however,
touring the San Diego area to make his own assessment of customs
needs, said at a news conference that most resources should go to
strengthening security along the border with Canada and at major U.S.
seaports.</LD>
<LD>   Bonner said some new agents are needed at California border
stations, but he noted that wait times in San Diego have begun to
return to pre-Sept. 11 levels because agents are working longer
hours.</LD>
<TE>   A congressional subcommittee heard the case for speeding commerce
across the border, and also was told of a significant drop in the
number of undocumented immigrants trying to cross the border since
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Arrests of undocumented immigrants have fallen dramatically since
border inspectors began stepped-up searches of cars and more rigorous
document checks, a sign that far fewer people are trying to cross
illegally, authorities say. The searches, meanwhile, have yielded
more drug seizures.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working longer and harder," said Rex Applegate, a customs
field operations official.</TE>
<TE>   Adele J. Fasano, director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service office in San Diego, said immigration fraud cases at ports of
entry have fallen by more than half. "There have been significant
effects of heightened border security," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing was held by a House subcommittee on criminal justice
and is one of a series along the Southwest and northern borders.</TE>
<TE>   The panel was represented by its chairman, Rep. Mark Souder, an
Indiana Republican. He was joined by Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego),
who has sought emergency economic aid for U.S. communities on the
border that have suffered lost sales due to crossing delays.</TE>
<TE>   Several business leaders said they support tighter terrorism
controls. They asked Congress, however, to send more inspectors to
cut waiting times, which grew to up to eight hours after the
terrorist attacks but have fallen to below an hour, on average.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to act and we need to do it quickly," said Viviana Ibanez
of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Fasano said an analysis of staffing needs indicated it would take
300 more INS inspectors--a 50% increase--to fully cover California's
six ports of entry.</TE>
<TE>   The border officials also urged Congress to improve pay for
inspectors and agents to prevent high turnover.</TE>
<TE>   William T. Veal, chief agent for the Border Patrol in San Diego,
said his agents are leaving for better-paying law enforcement
agencies in California. Last year, San Diego lost 282 agents from a
force of 2,200, mostly to other police jobs, he said. Base pay for
new border agents is between $25,000 and $31,000.</TE>
<TE>   Fasano also said the border crossing at San Ysidro, with 24
vehicle lanes and eight pedestrian lanes, must be expanded to
accommodate traffic from Tijuana. In 2000, 39 million people entered
at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest entrance point.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, border officials imposed the most stringent checks
in years. Inspectors began checking under the hoods and inside the
trunks of far more vehicles than usual. Immigration officials also
began conducting instant background checks on those crossing on foot.
Everyone entering now is required to carry photo identification.</TE>
<TE>   Those steps, plus increased vigilance by Border Patrol agents
outside the official ports, have been accompanied by a huge drop in
illegal crossing attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Since Oct. 1, arrests of undocumented migrants by Border Patrol
agents along 66 miles in San Diego have fallen by nearly 40%--to
about 18,000--compared to the same period a year earlier, authorities
said. The decline mirrors a trend along the 2,000-mile border, where
arrests since Oct. 1 are down by 45% from a year earlier. The drop is
especially significant because arrest levels last year were much
lower than in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Arrests at San Diego's three ports of entry also have fallen, from
a monthly average of 4,150 to fewer than 1,000, since Oct. 1, the
start of the federal fiscal year. Instances of immigrants smuggled
inside car trunks and hidden compartments have all but disappeared.
Bonner's visit to San Diego on Thursday was coincidental to the
congressional hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to look at the southern border," Bonner said. "There will
be some additional staffing here. But the large, significant amount
of new resources is going to go to the north and our ports. The
northern border with Canada has been much more chronically
understaffed."</TE>
<TE>   Bonner said the customs budget is being increased by $400 million
as a result of anti-terrorism concerns.</TE>

<HD>Back for a Moment to an October Day in '41</HD>
<DH>Memories: A time capsule buried at a grammar school yields
a glimpse of the past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 61 years, Doug Lemon tried to remember what was inside a time
capsule at Emery Park School in Alhambra.</LD>
<LD>   Lemon, 70, was a fifth-grader at the school when the capsule was
sealed into a cornerstone near the bottom of the auditorium doorway
Oct. 7, 1941.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, he watched with four other gray-haired Emery alumni
as a maintenance worker chipped away at the concrete, revealing a
blackened metal box wedged in a crevice. The tightly sealed box was
pried open.</LD>
<TE>   And there it was, on a list of students from every class, in loopy
cursive--Lemon's name.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," he said, tracing the letters with his finger. He had signed
the document as a 10-year-old, never imagining he would see it again.</TE>
<TE>   Alumna Ariel Duggan, 81, scanned damp, yellowed copies of the
Alhambra Post-Advocate, which were also in the capsule. Even though
she left the school in 1932, the capsule brought back fond memories
of Principal A.K. Kaufman, who was there when the capsule was sealed.</TE>
<TE>   Duggan marveled at the headline of a newspaper that read, "Yankees
Win Series 3-1." Others laughed as they looked at an advertisement
selling lamb shoulder for 27 cents per pound.</TE>
<TE>   It was Lemon who informed current Principal Jenny Cheng of the
capsule's existence. A low brick wall had partially obscured the
concrete plaque that read "1941."</TE>
<TE>   Lemon contacted Emery alumni to solicit donations for the
excavation effort. He raised $410 to tear down the wall, retrieve the
capsule and replace the brick. He also organized a reunion of alumni,
to be held in April.</TE>
<TE>   Cheng hopes to soon fill the empty hole with a 2002 time capsule.</TE>

<HD>2 Men Tied to Internet Piracy Gang Plead Guilty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were members of a global community of computer nerds who claimed
bragging rights for pirating the hottest software and DVD programs
and posting them on the Internet for anyone to download for free.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators say cyberspace gangs that make up the so-called
Warez community have cheated legitimate software and film
distributors out of billions of dollars in lost revenue.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, two key players in the most prominent gang, known as
DrinkorDie, pleaded guilty in Los Angeles federal court to criminal
charges of copyright infringement.</LD>
<TE>   Kentaga Kartadinata, 30, of Los Angeles and Mike Nguyen, 26, of
West Los Angeles agreed to cooperate with the U.S. Customs Service in
an investigation targeting Warez community members around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Christopher Johnson said in court that
indictments are expected soon against at least 50 other DrinkorDie
members.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of a plea agreement, Kartadinata and Nguyen each face
27 to 33 months in prison. They are free on bail pending sentencing a
year from now.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against them grew out of raids in December by law
enforcement officers in the United States, Australia, Finland,
England and Norway. Investigators seized more than 100 computers
allegedly used by members of the Warez (pronounced like wares) scene.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said Kartadinata and Nguyen are the first suspects charged
in the massive case.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen, a computer programmer at UCLA, managed several of the
group's file servers containing thousands of pirated software titles.</TE>
<TE>   "Every program you can find on the shelves at Fry's or Best Buy,
they had on the file servers available for downloading," Johnson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said Warez groups obtain copyrighted programs, sometimes
before they are released to the public. Members known as "crackers"
then remove security protections from the programs, making them ready
for distribution via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The Customs Service has estimated that more than 70% of all
illegal software sites on the Internet are operated by Warez
community members. The first group to disseminate a new software
product scores points, which are posted on a Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The Warez groups maintain their own e-mail servers, allowing
members to communicate with each other in relative privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Kartadinata handled that task for DrinkorDie. Last year, the
Customs Service obtained a court warrant to eavesdrop on
Kartadinata's e-mail server. Investigators were able to identify
members of the group and monitor their activities.</TE>
<TE>   DrinkorDie was founded in Moscow in 1993 by a Russian calling
himself Deviator. Johnson said Thursday that the group's membership
was about 75 until recently.</TE>
<TE>   In one of its earliest pirating feats, DrinkorDie boasted of
releasing MS Windows95 two weeks before Microsoft began selling it to
the American public.</TE>
<TE>   There are eight to 10 major groups and several smaller ones in the
Warez community, but Drink-orDie is considered the most accomplished,
according to the Customs Service.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles-area community activist has been charged with
unlawfully taking a vehicle and receiving stolen property,
prosecutors said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Melvin Farmer, who formed an antiviolence organization, pleaded
not guilty at the Inglewood Courthouse on Tuesday. Sheriff's deputies
arrested him last Friday and booked him into the Los Angeles County
jail. He is being held on $85,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   Farmer, 44, is a former gang member who grew up in South Los
Angeles. His organization, Parents Against Public Abuse, helped plan
a community meeting last month at Leimert Park to call for a gang
truce and promote peaceful neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   Farmer is scheduled for a preliminary hearing Feb. 8.</TE>

<HD>Simon and Jones Promise to Protect Local Tax Revenues</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The two, competing with Riordan for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination, try to stake their claim as the
conservative choice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Bill Simon Jr. and Bill Jones pledged to protect local tax dollars
from raids by state government Thursday as they continued to nip at
the front-runner's heels in California's race for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination.</LD>
<LD>   While Richard Riordan, the former Los Angeles mayor, spent the day
raising money, his two foes addressed a gathering of county
supervisors here and sparred over which of them is the true
conservative choice.</LD>
<LD>   Simon, buoyed by his recent surge in the polls, repeated a vow not
to raise taxes and highlighted his endorsement by the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. and another taxpayer rights group. The wealthy Los
Angeles business investor also noted that he is backed by some of the
state's most conservative legislators.</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State Jones, trailing in recent voter surveys and in
fund-raising, pledged for the first time that he, too, would refuse
to raise taxes to deal with the state's anticipated $12.5-billion
budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, the most seasoned politician in the group, also dismissed a
new Times poll that shows him finishing last in the March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   "One poll does not make an election," he said. "There are five
weeks to go, and our focus right now is not to peak too soon."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Riordan's double-digit lead, analysts say he remains
vulnerable if a rival can attract enough conservative voters and if
turnout is relatively low--a good possibility given the unusually
early date of the election.</TE>
<TE>   Jones says he will attract the support he needs once voters
realize he is a veteran who has put together coalitions he needed to
win two statewide elections. That message, he said, will ultimately
get through, even though he hasn't raised enough money to spread it
most effectively--through television ads.</TE>
<TE>   "I have proven I have the universe of voters I require to win,"
Jones said. "Mr. Simon can write checks for any amount he chooses ...
but you can't raise a record, and it'll take a record to beat Gray
Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Simon made their remarks to reporters after appearing
before the County Supervisors Assn. of California. Despite their
efforts to draw distinctions between themselves politically, their
speeches to the group were remarkably similar in tone.</TE>
<TE>   Both lambasted Gov. Davis for failing to help cities and counties
regain billions in property-tax revenue that was taken from their
coffers during the recession of the early 1990s and used by the state
to help fund schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Sacramento is forever promising and forever shortchanging local
government," Simon said. Davis, he added, should have tackled the
thorny problem of local government finances when the state was
enjoying a budget surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was an assemblyman at the time the funds were shifted, and
supported the move as a "temporary fix" to help the state through the
tough economic period.</TE>
<TE>   He faulted Davis for not "keeping the state's promise" to restore
the money and for ongoing "budget shenanigans" that could further
harm local governments.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Davis campaign, Roger Salazar, said the GOP
candidates "don't know what they're talking about."</TE>
<TE>   "The state has been very good in providing cities and counties a
lot of the funding they need for infrastructure, public safety and
other programs," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   "And the governor has pledged that we will not get through this
economic downturn on the backs of local governments."</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors said that the two Republican speakers seemed
attentive to their problems and covered all of the obvious issues,
but that neither bowled them over with creative ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "They hit all the buttons--bang, bang, bang," Humboldt County
Supervisor Roger Rodoni said. "But remember, we've been robbed. You
just never know what these guys will do once they get in."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan attended private fund-raisers Thursday in Los Angeles,
Newport Beach and San Diego. He has had no public appearances since
Tuesday and will have none for the next week, according to Ron
Hartwig, his campaign manager.</TE>

<HD>Kerkorian Denies Fathering Girl, 3</HD>
<DH>Courts: MGM executive submits results of DNA test in
increasingly bitter custody dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a surprise twist to an increasingly nasty child support dispute,
MGM mogul Kirk Kerkorian denied Thursday that he is the biological
father of a 3-year-old girl, Kira, whose mother is asking a Los
Angeles Superior Court judge to award a record $320,000 a month.</LD>
<LD>   The 84-year-old billionaire said in court papers that as the
mother's financial demands escalated, he felt as though he had been
set up and submitted strands of Kira's and his hair for a DNA test.
He learned in November 2000 that the test scientifically excluded him
as the father.</LD>
<LD>   The mother, former tennis pro Lisa Bonder Kerkorian, was informed
of the test results months ago, his court papers say.</LD>
<TE>   While denying he is Kira's biological father, Kerkorian said he
has grown attached to the girl and intends to continue to provide for
her. He has set up a trust fund for her education, and is asking the
court to award child support of no more than the $50,000 he currently
pays.</TE>
<TE>   That "already substantially exceeds any amount ever ordered by the
Los Angeles Superior Court--or any other court in the United States,"
said his attorney, Dennis M. Wasser.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian's lawyer, Stephen A. Kolodny, could not be reached
for comment</TE>
<TE>   The bitter dispute became public last month, when Lisa Kerkorian
filed papers in the couple's divorce seeking to increase Kira's
monthly support. She and her lawyer argued that the child should not
suffer because the relationship between her parents recently has
chilled.</TE>
<TE>   Her version of the story portrayed a lavish lifestyle with a man
so leery of marriage that he had his lawyer talk her into a
preplanned 29-day marriage and quickie divorce that she says left her
heartbroken. She says that at the time of their marriage she waived
all her rights to spousal support because he promised he'd always
take care of Kira's every need.</TE>
<TE>   When times were good, she said, Kira enjoyed perks "befitting the
daughter of Kirk Kerkorian,"--including a $70,000 birthday party at
the Hotel Bel-Air, summer vacations in France, a phalanx of nannies
and bodyguards, and $436 a month for care of her pets, including a
bunny Kerkorian gave as a Christmas present.</TE>
<TE>   In his version, Kirk Kerkorian charges that she fabricated the
story that he was Kira's father "for her own monetary benefit and to
remain a part of my life despite the nonexistence of a romantic
relationship between us."</TE>
<TE>   The money demanded, he said, would benefit the mother, not the
child.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter is that Kira is not able to comprehend
the difference between a lifestyle based upon $30,000 per month or
$300,000 per month; nor does she have any meaningful way to benefit
from any such difference," Wasser argued in the court papers filed
late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite reasonable to believe that Kira would be far happier
eating a 'Happy Meal' at McDonald's and playing at McDonaldsland than
she would be sitting at a dinner table in an upscale, adult
restaurant being shushed by a coterie of nannies so as not to bother"
her mother and the other adults. "Similarly," the document said, Kira
would be much happier going to Disneyland than "taking a long, boring
plane trip to Paris."</TE>
<TE>   The legal filing alleges that the couple stopped cohabiting in
1995, two years before Kira was born. He said he broke off the
relationship after learning she was "telling people that she believed
I should be giving her money because I was doing well in my business.
I was deeply disturbed that [she] secretly had such discussions with
people around me."</TE>
<TE>   He said he gave her $1 million to start her life over in New York.
Instead, he said, she "simply moved into a friend's house and kept
the money."</TE>
<TE>   He followed that up with $4 million in June 1997, leading to a
weeklong reconciliation during which they had sex, according to the
court papers. Three months later, he said, she told him that she was
pregnant and that was absolutely certain he was the father.</TE>
<TE>   He said he took her at her word and accepted both financial and
psychological responsibility for the child, who was born in March
1998. Initially, he paid $20,000 a month in support. Later, he said,
Lisa Kerkorian submitted a list of her expenses, saying she, her
teenage son from her first marriage, and Kira could live comfortably
on $48,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "By the summer of 1999," he continued, she was pressing him to
marry her. "When I refused, she appeared depressed. I was extremely
concerned about her emotional state and how it might affect Kira," he
said. She told him it was "difficult to be the mother of our
out-of-wedlock child, and that she felt society looked down upon
her."</TE>
<TE>   He says she agreed to a brief marriage, then balked at divorcing
him. He said they never occupied the same home. Four months after
their marriage, she again demanded money from him, Kerkorian charged.
This time, the money was to remodel a house in Beverly Hills, where
she would raise Kira. She said she needed $4.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian said he paid her $2.5 million when their divorce became
final. At that point, he said, her "animosity toward me increased
dramatically. No matter what I did, and despite the increasing sums
of money I had given to her, that animosity only got worse."</TE>
<TE>   She moved to New York but never stayed long. Kerkorian said she
told him that she found an "acceptable" apartment for $12million, but
that the "really nice" apartments cost $30 million to $40 million.
She agreed to return to Los Angeles if Kerkorian would set up a
$25-million trust fund for her, his court papers say.</TE>
<TE>   That was the final straw for the billionaire. He said he finally
told her, no.</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship continued to deteriorate. Finally, on Christmas
Day, Kerkorian alleges, she tossed a toy Mickey Mouse phone he had
given Kira the previous evening over his gate. The toy broke into
pieces. Then, he says, she threatened to toss the pet bunny over the
fence as well. They haven't spoken since.</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Killing of Wife Who Vanished</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The son-in-law of a former California senator was arrested Thursday
on suspicion of killing his wife, who has been missing since August,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Koklich, 42, was charged with murdering Jana
Carpenter-Koklich, who disappeared from their Lakewood home Aug. 18
and has still not been found, the district attorney's office said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim's father was Paul Carpenter, a former state senator
from Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators arrested Koklich just after noon Thursday
outside his real estate office in Long Beach. He was booked into the
Lakewood sheriff's station and transferred to the Twin Towers jail
near downtown Los Angeles, where he is being held in lieu of
$1-million bail. He is scheduled to appear at the Los Cerritos
Courthouse today for arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities declined to discuss the case other than to describe
what led to the murder charges as "a preponderance of evidence."</TE>
<TE>   "There's no body and no one substantial piece of evidence,"
Sheriff's Lt. Ray Peavy said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
"It's a combination and accumulation of facts that developed through
the investigation that led to this point."</TE>
<TE>   Peavy said the case is largely circumstantial but that "we believe
he did it." Koklich had been under surveillance since his wife's
disappearance. Detectives would not discuss a motive.</TE>
<TE>   Koklich's attorney, Henry Salcido, said his client maintains his
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "First he loses his wife, and now the wrong person is being
arrested," said the lawyer, who also attended the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Koklich allegedly killed his wife "on or about Aug. 18," according
to court papers. The 41-year-old real estate agent was last seen
early that Saturday morning, when a friend dropped her off at home
after they attended a concert at Staples Center together, detectives
said.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter-Koklich, described by friends as punctual and
fastidious, missed several appointments that weekend and failed to
return phone calls, including one from her mother, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Koklich reported his wife missing two days later, when she didn't
show up at their office and he couldn't find her at their home.</TE>
<TE>   He offered a $100,000 reward for any information. Detectives said
Koklich agreed, but later declined, three times to take a polygraph
test.</TE>
<TE>   Salcido said the reason Carpenter-Koklich did not return phone
calls that weekend was because the couple had come back from a
business trip in Las Vegas earlier in the week and they "were tired
and wanted to spend some quality time together." He said the couple
were happily married and were planning to adopt children.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 27, Carpenter-Koklich's bloodstained Nissan Pathfinder was
found abandoned in a garage in Signal Hill, with her keys still in
the ignition. Three teenagers had been seen joy-riding in the car,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, a handgun taken from her purse was handed over
to authorities. In October, DNA tests confirmed that blood in the car
was Carpenter-Koklich's, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Peavy said he believes the body is probably hidden near where the
car was discovered, he but expressed doubts about it ever being
found. Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Dohi said prosecuting a murder case
without a body will be challenging.</TE>
<TE>   Koklich was not the only suspect investigators considered,
authorities said. "The detectives working the case looked at a number
of different leads, not just those that involved Mr. Koklich," Dohi
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Salcido said sheriff's investigators did not aggressively
pursue the possibility that the teenagers seen driving the Pathfinder
were involved in her death.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after his daughter disappeared, Paul Carpenter said he
doubted that she would return home safely.</TE>
<TE>   As detectives updated Carpenter-Koklich's family about the
investigation, her parents expressed their belief that their
son-in-law had something to do with their daughter's death, Peavy
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially they seemed to support him," he said. "But as time went
by, and not a whole lot of time, they let it be known to us they
thought their son-in-law was responsible for their daughter's death."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter-Koklich's mother, Janeth Carpenter, said Thursday that
over time, she became convinced that her son-in-law was to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I supported him for about a month, because I just couldn't
believe he could do such a thing," she said. "But after I reviewed
all the evidence, there just wasn't any other explanation."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter said that the last five months have been difficult and
that the arrest doesn't make it any easier.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel very sad," she said. "Jana and Bruce were my
whole family."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Carpenter, a Democrat from Cypress, served in the Assembly
and state Senate before being convicted of political corruption and
spending four years in prison. He died last week of cancer.</TE>

<LD>   The Hack Hotline is back.</LD>
<LD>   An allegation of astounding insolence on the part of a public
servant has come in over the transom, and we have conducted a
thorough investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Before we get to the goods, however, many readers have asked what
ever happened to our last featured hack, the Robo Ranger of Griffith
Park.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen of you have told me of your own run-ins with
this junior crimebuster. The trial of one poor soul who got into an
altercation with Robo is set for March 4. Check this space for
updates.</TE>
<TE>   Now to the matter at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Chan, 67, got laid off from Lockheed 11 years ago and now
works for Second Careers, which sent him to the L.A. Times recently
on a temporary job.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Monterey Park man went to an art supply shop on an
errand. Larry parked at Boyd and Omar in downtown L.A. and put a
quarter in the meter, but the meter flashed red. Out of order.</TE>
<TE>   Larry went into the store to take care of his business. Moments
later, he happened to look out the window, and what did he see? You
know exactly what he saw. He saw a traffic officer writing him a
parking ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "I went out and told her it doesn't work," says Larry, a
soft-spoken, nonconfrontational gent.</TE>
<TE>   "Demonstrate it," the meter maid ordered Larry, who wasn't
sure why the flashing red flag wasn't demonstration enough. But good
citizen that he is, Larry reached into his pocket for another
quarter, and when the meter ate it without registering any time, the
traffic officer tore up the ticket.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't seem fair to Larry that he had to put the second quarter
in the meter, but he counted his blessings and walked back into the
store.</TE>
<TE>   Less than five minutes passed. Larry looked out the window again,
and what did he see? He saw yet another traffic cop writing yet
another ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Larry must have parked in the fattest fishing hole in all of Los
Angeles, and the meter maids were taking turns bagging this poor
lunker.</TE>
<TE>   Larry made another mad dash out the door.</TE>
<TE>   "Another officer just tore up a ticket," he protested. "The meter
is broken."</TE>
<TE>   To which this lug responded: "Demonstrate it."</TE>
<TE>   Is there an echo in downtown L.A. Are drill sergeants drumming
this into young recruits at meter maid boot camp? And why does the
citizen have to keep digging for coins? Can't this cop wannabe open
his eyes and have a look for himself, or maybe demonstrate it with
his own quarter?</TE>
<TE>   Larry reached into his pocket. Out of quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Hold on, he said, scrambling back into the store to borrow one.
Coin in hand, he raced back out and dropped the quarter into the
slot. Once more, the meter flashed red as the planet Mars, and the
traffic officer did something that signaled the apocalypse is near.</TE>
<TE>   He handed Larry the ticket anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Larry, it seems, did not "demonstrate it" quickly enough. The fine
is $30.</TE>
<TE>   What can we as citizens do in the face of such godlessness? For
starters, I'm setting up a legal defense fund, and you're welcome to
contribute to it.</TE>
<TE>   Free Larry, not Winona!</TE>
<TE>   I went back with Larry on Wednesday and the meter was
still broken. The digital window was red on one side and said Fail and
Out of Order on the other.</TE>
<TE>   We watched David Takeuchi, an unsuspecting copy machine repairman,
pull into the space. When we told him the meter was broken, Takeuchi
said:</TE>
<TE>   "I better move the car then. Even if you park at one with a bag
over it, and the meter says Fail, they'll come by and give you a
ticket. It's utterly asinine," he said, big, bold emphasis on
asinine. The city wants people to do business downtown, David said,
but then it does idiotic things like this.</TE>
<TE>   It might be part of a plan. Mayor Jim Hahn projects a $250-million
deficit, so maybe he's going to square the books by taking it out of
our hides in parking fines.</TE>
<TE>   I went back Thursday and the meter was still broken. I did a quick
check on Omar Street, a short block, and found no fewer than 12 more
meters broken.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of junk did the city buy? These digital jobs are only a
few years old, and half of them are on the fritz.</TE>
<TE>   And instead of calling someone to have them fixed, eager meter
maids are papering the city with $30 tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Any chance they're lying in wait, filling out quotas?</TE>
<TE>   The Hack Hotline rang up Rudy Carrasco, deputy chief in Parking
Enforcement, and reported the incident, as well as the name of the
offending hack officer.</TE>
<TE>   Carrasco said officers are supposed to call in repair orders for
broken meters, so either these two winners never called or the fix-it
crew is in hibernation. He said Larry's ticket will be canceled if it
can be determined that the meter was broken.</TE>
<TE>   Just cancel the ticket, Rudy. The meter was broken then; it's
broken now.</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of quotas, Carrasco claimed there aren't any.</TE>
<TE>   Oh no?</TE>
<TE>   No way, he said. There's a "work performance standard" that's
checked periodically against historic "service" in each area, but no
quota.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a "baseline review" of each officer's output, but no
quota.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, well I've got follicle recession, but no baldness.</TE>
<TE>   Carrasco promised a prompt investigation of the ticket writer's
record and a review of Larry's $30 citation. I'd like to believe him,
but two words come to mind:</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrate it.</TE>

<HD>Not a Ghost of a Chance Sleuth Will Investigate This
Missing-Person Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The missing-person request seemed routine at first.</LD>
<LD>   A man asked Long Beach private investigator Frank Crescentini to
find his wife, whom he'd last seen four years earlier. Asked where
the sighting had been, the would-be client named a local cemetery.
And what she was doing there? The man said she had just been buried.
She was dead, he explained. But, he added, her spirit was stalking
him.</LD>
<LD>   Crescentini told him in so many words that he didn't do
missing-spirit jobs.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bad detective work on my part: Crescentini and I got together
after I mentioned seeing a private investigator's license plate--LA
PI--on the mean streets of Long Beach. I wondered how a sleuth could
conduct surveillance with a car advertising his profession.</TE>
<TE>   Crescentini phoned to say it was his license but assured me that,
when he was on the job, he used unmarked cars.</TE>
<TE>   At his recommendation, we met at a joint called Polly's. I figured
it would be a dark, mysterious bar. It was a coffeehouse. Sam Spade's
spirit wasn't stalking us.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tough to slice: On the subject of altered restaurant names, David
Allen, a columnist for the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, served up a
pizza joint with an odd sign.</TE>
<TE>   After Bulletin photographer Jeff Malet snapped a shot of it (see
photo), Allen says, the sign was covered "with a banner touting how
the restaurant had changed hands." Thus, the new name appeared to be
Under New Management Pizza.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another retread: "Years ago, my ex-husband wanted to start a used
car business on a shoestring budget with his friend Mark," wrote
Wendy Mollett of Studio City. "They found a long defunct Arco station
on Los Feliz Boulevard and simply painted one big letter in front of
the already fading sign to create Marco. The business, and the
husband, didn't last long."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking another spin at it: I'm still hearing about the newspaper
misprint of a spinet piano, which came out "spin-it." At least I
think it should have said spinet.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm no longer sure after having heard from Jennifer Devine of
Sherman Oaks and Paul Daniels of Huntington Beach. They cited the
example of Keith Emerson of the rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels remembered an early 1970s concert at the now-defunct
Ontario Motor Speedway in which Emerson had "a grand piano that
lifted up and spun in circles end-over-end while he played."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lacking only a business card: As for the ad that appeared here
about a chatty dog described in part as "house spoken ... spade,"
Barbara Kussman of Encino says:</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, Steve, you missed a terrific opportunity to point out that
THIS is a dog that could clean up for himself! Maybe even start a
pooper-scooper business."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Wouldn't you just know it? Everyone else is shivering
in the Southland, but the sun is out in Beverly Hills. Really out.</TE>
<TE>   At least that was the indication in a recent National Weather
Service forecast spotted by Joel Davis of L.A. (see accompanying).</TE>

<HD>Activists Say U.S. Yields to Ranchers, Miners in
Transferring BLM Official</HD>
<DH>Environment: One faction says the manager didn't do enough
to guard the desert; others accuse him of being too protective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A key federal official assigned to referee land-use disputes in the
California desert has been removed from his post amid protests from
environmentalists that the Bush administration is bowing to pressure
from miners, ranchers and off-road vehicle enthusiasts.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Salt, a 27-year veteran of the Bureau of Land Management, had
been a lightning rod for criticism from all factions over federal
policy in the 11-million-acre desert.</LD>
<LD>   After three years as manager of the agency's California Desert
District, Salt was given a new job whose duties have yet to be fully
defined. An acting manager will assume responsibility for the
Riverside-based district Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a definite pattern by this administration to reassign
administrators who have an environmental ethic," said Karen
Schambach, California coordinator for Public Employees for
Environment Responsibility. "It's very distressing."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Bedrosian, spokeswoman for Michael Pool, the top BLM official
in California, denied that the reassignment was prompted by political
pressure. She said job shifts are not uncommon among top managers.</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, Henri Brisson, BLM's assistant director,
called Salt "a talented professional who will be an excellent
addition to our national team." Salt's new job will include working
with issues of renewable resources throughout the Western U.S., the
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Salt, 52, said he does not feel he is being punished, but added
that he had not sought reassignment and had hoped to remain as
manager of the desert district.</TE>
<TE>   Salt's career arc shows that it is possible to go from being
lionized in one administration to being reassigned in the next.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton administration, Salt received the Department of
the Interior's meritorious service award from Secretary Bruce Babbitt
for his work in preserving the California desert. Salt was associate
district manager for two years before being named manager in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Seaver, president of the 18,000-member American Sand Assn.,
many of whose members enjoy riding a variety of vehicles in the
desert, said he is not sorry to see Salt replaced, even though he
always found Salt cordial and accessible.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is hopeful there will be a change at BLM under a new
district manager," Seaver said. "I'm hopeful we can get somebody who
will look at the facts a little better."</TE>
<TE>   One controversy during Salt's tenure that particularly rankled
off-roaders involves a desert plant called the Peirson's milk vetch.
To protect the plant, the federal government has ruled large portions
of the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area east of Brawley off-limits
to all vehicles and camping.</TE>
<TE>   The sand association has petitioned the Interior Department to
overturn a ruling that the milk vetch is imperiled and in need of
protection. The group says Salt and other officials ignored data
showing that the milk vetch is flourishing despite off-roading.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim was very nice and patient, but he absolutely would not accept
our data," Seaver said.</TE>
<TE>   Similar disputes have festered over protections afforded the
desert tortoise, the peninsular bighorn sheep and other creatures.
Ranchers have complained that they are no longer able to use federal
land to graze their cattle, and miners have said federal regulations
are nearly killing their industry.</TE>
<TE>   Salt said he found it ironic that the environmental groups,
including the Sierra Club and Tucson-based Center for Biological
Diversity, are upset with his reassignment given the fact that they
had sued him for allegedly not doing enough to protect wildlife and
vegetation as required by endangered species and desert protection
laws.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement of that lawsuit led to complaints that the
government caved in to the environmentalists and imposed unnecessary
restrictions rather than fight the suit. "The miners, the off-roaders
and the ranchers are upset because of the agreements we entered into
to settle the lawsuit," Salt said. "As we tried to implement those
agreements, their concerns have grown."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalist leaders say the notion that Salt was a patsy for
their views is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We had our differences with Salt but at least he was trying to
follow the law," said Earthjustice attorney Jay Tutchton.</TE>
<TE>   Even some off-road supporters who disagreed with Salt's views on
the desert, and the lawsuit settlement, say his departure may not
mark a sharp change in policy.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people are frustrated with what has gone on in the desert
under Tim Salt," said Boise attorney Paul Turcke, who represented
off-roaders in the environmental lawsuit. "But the idea that removing
Tim will mean wholesale changes is unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   "A BLM manager is not like a captain of a ship making all the
calls," he said. "There is a big bureaucracy involved."</TE>

<HD>Parks Seeks 2nd Term as LAPD Chief</HD>
<DH>Politics: Decision will set off a fierce battle with the
officers union and put the mayor in a tight spot. The Police
Commission's ruling is expected by mid-May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police Chief Bernard C. Parks announced Thursday that he will seek a
second term as head of the Los Angeles Police Department, setting the
stage for a pitched political battle in coming weeks over whether he
should remain in the job--one of the city's most prominent but
controversy-racked public positions.</LD>
<LD>   "I am formally transmitting my request to the Los Angeles Police
Commission for a second five-year term," Parks said at a dinner in
Hollywood marking his 37th anniversary as a member of the force. "I
do intend to go forward. I believe I've made an impact."</LD>
<LD>   Following a process laid out in the City Charter, the commission,
a group of five civilians appointed by Mayor James K. Hahn, will
decide whether to reappoint Parks by mid-May--or earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Controversy has been brewing for months over whether the chief
should be granted a final five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents
rank-and-file officers, wants him out and has pledged to spend about
$1.5 million toward that goal.</TE>
<TE>   But Parks' supporters, among them organizations representing
minority officers, have responded with increasing intensity.</TE>
<TE>   This has spawned a series of tit-for-tat media events and
demonstrations in which the union criticizes Parks, while his
defenders--including Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas--strike back with
blistering condemnations of the union's tactics.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of this storm is the enigmatic, paradoxical LAPD
veteran, a tall man whose slightly wooden way of carrying himself
blends easily into descriptions of his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' enemies portray him as aloof and unbending; his friends, as
strong and incorruptible.</TE>
<TE>   Such descriptions have helped create a highly recognizable public
image, further popularized by his inclusion on a 1998 People magazine
list of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.</TE>
<TE>   As chief, however, his record evades simple labels. Parks, 58, has
made far-reaching reforms in officer discipline while being called a
reactionary by some. He is a decentralizer accused of being
autocratic, and a man who purports to eschew politics, while emitting
a crackling political aura.</TE>
<TE>   He is also the straight-arrow chief who was in charge when
revelations of corruption within the LAPD came to light. The Rampart
Division scandal involving violent drug-dealing officers was
investigated on his watch, with the result that the LAPD's reputation
became stained in the public's mind even as Parks was striving to be
seen as a disciplinarian.</TE>
<TE>   Even his most steadfast supporters say some of the changes he has
made have been problematic, while, oddly, his staunchest critics
sometimes praise him the most.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Mitzi Grasso, his nemesis as president of the
officers union, lauds his integrity and work ethic, saying, "He could
have been the best chief the city ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Blamed for Low</TE>
<TE>   Morale Among Officers</TE>
<TE>   Grasso blames Parks for low morale among the rank and file, a
failure to recruit more officers and ineffective leadership.
Recently, 93% of LAPD officers who responded to a union poll said
they have no confidence in him.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are looking for is someone who is willing to
collaborate," said Grasso, "and who is not afraid to admit if they
are wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Parks' supporters retort that the chief is scapegoated precisely
because he has been so effective at making reforms that--especially
in the area of discipline--have made officers uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "Chief Parks did everything that [former Police Chief Willie]
Williams was supposed to do and didn't," said Deputy Chief Michael J.
Bostic. "That has not been popular."</TE>
<TE>   Under Parks, the department has been riven by controversy. He
clashed with then-Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti over the Rampart
investigation, and with civil libertarians over police shootings of
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   He objected to Mayor Hahn's efforts to allow some officers to work
three- and four-day weeks, a perk that the union furiously lobbied
for.</TE>
<TE>   The union prevailed, and compressed workweeks are being introduced
at area stations. But acrimony lingers.</TE>
<TE>   A similar battle erupted over senior lead officers--community
policing specialists--which placed Parks in conflict with many
community activists. He moved to place the officers back in patrol
cars. But last year, then-Mayor Richard Riordan ordered the program
reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   In what may be his most controversial change, Parks revamped the
LAPD's disciplinary process in ways that have resulted in more public
complaints being investigated, and more officers censured or fired.
Previously, the LAPD had been criticized for failing to follow up on
citizen complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Community activists such as Msgr. John Moretta, whose Boyle
Heights parish is in a neighborhood troubled by gang violence, said
officer morale has fallen to harmful depths under the chief's
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Although he calls Parks, "a very righteous man," Moretta faults
the chief for not seeing "that there is a different way of doing
things. Not just his way."</TE>
<TE>   But Lawrence Tolliver, owner of L. Tolliver's Barbershop, argues
that Parks is well qualified and deserves another term.</TE>
<TE>   Tolliver was among several hundred South-Central Los Angeles
residents, most of them African American, who turned out for a
meeting of the Police Commission this week at Ward African Methodist
Episcopal Church. So popular is the chief, who is black, that the
meeting had the air of a pep rally, with attendees waving signs that
said, "Five More Years."</TE>
<TE>   "People from all walks of life are saying [the LAPD] has changed
since Parks has taken over," said Tolliver. "You are treated better
than you were before."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Feuer, a former city councilman and now a lawyer in private
practice, praises Parks for his integrity and dedication, and
especially for his willingness to carry out difficult policies in the
face of resistance.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, Feuer said Parks' seemingly uncompromising
approach to such suggested changes as compressed work schedules for
officers showed a certain lack of political finesse--something that
might make him more effective.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the complicated character that he is," Feuer said.
"There is a lot to admire in someone who assesses the merits of
things before just rolling over. But [Parks] so often doesn't listen
to a contrary point of view [that] he creates a situation of
conflict."</TE>
<TE>   In making his announcement Thursday night, the chief said his aim
is to provide the city with a Police Department that "both ensures
safety and treats people properly."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Caruso, president of the Police Commission, said the panel
will decide within two weeks what criteria it will use to evaluate
Parks' leadership of the department.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said that the commission will bring in outside counsel to
advise the panel through the process but that the commissioners will
do the evaluation themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to make it a quicker process than a longer one," he
said. "If we can do it within 30 to 45 days, that would be great. Our
No. 1 priority is doing a thorough job and making it fair. We're
dealing with someone's job here."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said Thursday that he will express his opinion about the
chief sometime during the evaluation process, but he backed away from
previous statements that cast the decision as his to make.</TE>
<TE>   "My opinion is just one opinion," the mayor said on a radio
call-in show. "I hope the Police Commission will consider it along
with opinions of a lot of different community leaders, but the
important thing is that the Police Commission, as an independent
body, make that decision."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor's Formal Role</TE>
<TE>   in Process Is Limited</TE>
<TE>   Hahn acknowledged that as mayor, he plays no formal role in the
reappointment process unless the Police Commission fails to act. And
he said he would not put political pressure on his appointees.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they listen to my opinion, but I'm not going to tell them
what to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council could also eventually play a role, having the
authority to review and reject the commission's judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' bid for a second term puts Hahn in a tight political pinch
between supporters in the African American community and backers in
the rank and file. The mayor has repeatedly said political pressure
will not affect his opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those great political no-win situations, and if you
can't win either way, then the best thing to do is always to do the
right thing, do what is the right decision anyway," Hahn said. "The
best way to evaluate any decision that comes to you is to make that
decision on the merits."</TE>
<TE>   With the imperviousness that drives his detractors up the wall,
Parks in recent weeks has said he was ignoring the political swirl.</TE>
<TE>   "Five percent of the public loves us for everything we do; 5%
hates us for everything we do. We should ignore both and pay
attention to the 90% in the middle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And improbably, given that his staff routinely holds news
conferences to rebut the union's charges, Parks claims not to be
paying attention to the reappointment battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I do what I do for the right reasons," he said. "Consistently,
and for the right reasons."</TE>

<LD>Saying their enemy is often an antiquated radio, representatives of
numerous police and fire agencies called Thursday for a
state-of-the-art communications network linking emergency workers
across Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 police officers and firefighters reviewed a plan by
the city of Glendale for a network connecting radio systems in dozens
of cities. It would allow police and fire departments to communicate
with neighboring jurisdictions while maintaining local control of
their radio traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Glendale officials presented their proposal to municipal safety
agencies including Torrance, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Maywood,
Arcadia, El Segundo and Montebello.</LD>
<TE>   The cost of the regional system, expected to total several million
dollars, will be determined by how many agencies join the network.</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's meeting at Glendale Fire Department
headquarters, emergency workers said they are forced to rely on old,
limited-frequency radios that do not work outside their
jurisdictions. That cuts off communications during long-range police
pursuits or disasters that require neighboring agencies to help each
other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dangerous situation," said Steven Hronek, an information
services administrator for Glendale. "Not only dangerous but
unnecessary.... The public expects that we're already able to
communicate with each other."</TE>
<TE>   He said the problem extends to the city of Los Angeles, where a
$21-million communications system installed last year provoked
complaints from officers who said they had trouble radioing each
other.</TE>
<TE>   A regional network would accommodate radios using narrow or wide
bands and analog or digital technology, Hronek said.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale's City Council last year approved $16.2 million to
upgrade its obsolete radio system. That sum includes $300,000 for
technology to connect to transmitter sites in Beverly Hills and
Culver City, two communities that already have decided to become part
of the regional network.</TE>
<TE>   It would have cost Glendale $1.5 million to build its own
transmitters, Hronek estimated.</TE>
<TE>   He and other officials said the network would help cities maintain
the high security alert ordered after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The officials said they hope to obtain federal grants to help pay for
the systems.</TE>
<TE>   During his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, President Bush
called for nearly doubling federal funding for homeland security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a hot issue," said Simone Slifman, a management analyst
in Culver City's grants administration office. "Now is the time to
act."</TE>
<TE>   Hermosa Beach Fire Capt. Brian Scott said a regional network is
long overdue. He recalled fighting wind-whipped flames with workers
from other county departments.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us could communicate with each other," Scott said. "We
had to carry several radios or use cell phones, which don't always
work in the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "Every second is critical. We don't want to waste any time
figuring how we're going to communicate."</TE>

<HD>Harold Russell, 88; Disabled Actor Won 2 Oscars for 'The
Best Years of Our Lives'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harold Russell, the disabled World War II veteran who received two
Academy Awards for his role in "The Best Years of Our Lives," has
died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Russell, who lost both of his hands in an explosion during the
war, died Tuesday of a heart attack in Needham, Mass., his family
announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "The Best Years of Our Lives," was the runaway hit of the 1946
Academy Awards. The film, which dealt with the harsh realities of
servicemen adjusting to changed families and a changing country after
years of warfare, won seven Academy Awards and a special Oscar,
including those for best picture, best director for William Wyler and
best actor for Frederic March. It also won for best screenplay, music
and editing.</LD>
<TE>   Russell's two Oscars, one for best supporting actor and a special
award from the academy governors, made him the only person in academy
history to win two awards for the same role. Years later, he would
make headlines again when he decided to sell one of his statuettes.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Nova Scotia, Russell was raised in the Cambridge, Mass.,
area. After high school, he worked as a meat cutter in a local
market.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Army the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor and
was trained as a paratrooper and an explosives expert. On D-day,
Russell was training soldiers at Camp Mackall, N.C., in the use of
explosives when a defective fuse ignited a charge of TNT.</TE>
<TE>   His hands were so severely injured that they had to be amputated,
and he was fitted with hooks. A short time later, he was cast in his
first film, an Army documentary, "Diary of a Sergeant," about the
rehabilitation of an amputee.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russell had no speaking role, his presence impressed
director Wyler, who saw the film some time later after he had begun
early work on "The Best Years of Our Lives." In an early screenplay
for that movie, the Russell character had suffered severe
neurological damage causing spastic paralysis. But the movie makers
thought the character too difficult for audiences to accept.</TE>
<TE>   Wyler remembered Russell from the training film, and the part of
Homer Parrish was rewritten to reflect his disability.</TE>
<TE>   Russell's portrayal was so well received, both critically and
commercially, that he was nominated for best supporting actor. But
the field that year included veteran actors Charles Coburn, Clifton
Webb and Claude Rains.</TE>
<TE>   The academy decided to give Russell a special Oscar to reflect
"the hope and courage he brought to his fellow veterans" through his
appearance in the film.</TE>
<TE>   With such stiff competition for supporting actor, the message was
clear, he said years later. "They were so certain I wouldn't win," he
told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Temple presented the special award, one of the first of
its kind, early in the program, which was broadcast on radio in those
pre-television days.</TE>
<TE>   "Then when they announced my name for best supporting actor, no
one was more surprised than me," Russell said. "Well, maybe those
guys who voted me the special award."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Oscars experience, he decided to follow
advice from the film's director.</TE>
<TE>   "Wyler told me I should go back to college, because there wasn't
much call for a guy with no hands in the motion picture industry,"
Russell said.</TE>
<TE>   He pursued a degree in business at Boston University, wrote an
autobiography titled "Victory in My Hands" and later started a public
relations business.</TE>
<TE>   He also began what was to be his lifelong quest, to help the
disabled.</TE>
<TE>   In that capacity he served as a consultant in business, industry,
state and federal governments and even the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson named him chairman of the
President's Committee on Hiring the Handicapped.</TE>
<TE>   Russell's message in most of his talks to groups of disabled
workers was simple: "It's not what you lost, but what you have left
and how you use it."</TE>
<TE>   He appeared infrequently in Hollywood after "Best Years."</TE>
<TE>   His credits included small roles in "Inside Moves," a 1980 film by
Richard Donner in which he played a card-playing barfly; and
"Dogstown," by George Hickenlooper, in which he played a disabled
World War II veteran. He also appeared in episodes of TV's "China
Beach" and "Trapper John, M.D."</TE>
<TE>   Russell made headlines in 1992 when he decided to sell his Oscar
for best supporting actor.</TE>
<TE>   After placing an ad in Variety, he got a letter from the academy's
then-president, Karl Malden, urging him to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "Your own statuettes in particular are among the best known that
the academy has ever awarded," Malden said. "While that fact may give
them additional luster on the open market, it also gives particular
poignancy to the possibility that either of them could be sold away
like an autographed baseball and consigned to who-knows-what future
history."</TE>
<TE>   The academy offered Russell $20,000 not to sell his award, but he
held out and eventually sold it for more than $60,000 to an anonymous
bidder.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that we were desperate or hungry," he said later. "It
was just that we have a lot of children and grandchildren, and we
wanted to put something away in case any of them ever needed
something."</TE>
<TE>   But he also said the special Oscar had more value to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never sell the special one," he said. "The war was over, and
this was the industry's way of saying thank you to the veterans."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a son, a daughter, four grandchildren and seven
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Utility officials have proposed a $4.6-billion bond measure for the
November ballot to upgrade the 68-year-old Hetch Hetchy water system.</LD>
<LD>   The cost would be covered through a series of increases in water
rates charged to 2.4 million Hetch Hetchy customers in San Francisco,
Alameda, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties.</LD>
<LD>   If the measure is approved as is, the average four-person San
Francisco household will see its monthly water bill more than triple
from an average of $13.28 to $43.93 by 2015.</LD>

<LD>Two Air Force jets were scrambled to the Golden Gate Bridge during
the evening commute hours Thursday after bridge officials noticed two
small airplanes circling the famous span.</LD>
<LD>   The small propeller planes left the area after about 15 minutes,
said Golden Gate Bridge District Lt. Mike Locati.</LD>
<LD>   He said small planes are not supposed to be in the area, a rule
instituted after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Bridge officials followed protocol and called the Federal Aviation
Administration, which had the jets sent to the area, Locati said.</TE>
<TE>   He called the appearance of the two small planes so close to the
bridge "out of the ordinary."</TE>

<HD>Thousands Eligible for Scholarship Program</HD>
<DH>Education: Appearing at a Reseda high school, Davis
announces the $1,000 grants for students who excel on Stanford 9.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 113,000 of California's top-performing high school students
learned Thursday that they are eligible for $1,000 merit scholarships
under the Governor's Scholars Awards program.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis, who made the initiative a cornerstone of his 2000
education reform package, announced the awards at an assembly at
Cleveland High School in Reseda.</LD>
<LD>   "Extraordinary results deserve extraordinary rewards," Davis told
several hundred students, teachers and parents jammed into the school
auditorium. "This is not a giveaway program; it is a merit program."</LD>
<TE>   With more than two dozen of the school's 196 scholarship winners
standing behind him on stage, Davis encouraged the students to study
hard, plan for college and expect to be rewarded for their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "If you didn't get [a scholarship] this year, guess what: The
Stanford 9s are coming again in March and April, and you have another
chance," Davis said, referring to the standardized testing that is
used to gauge student performance. "I want people to go to college,
and I don't want money to be a barrier."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was introduced by Marisa Del Pino, 18, Cleveland's
Associated Student Body president and a scholarship recipient. She
said that the $1,000 will help pay her tuition at one of the
University of California campuses to which she has applied.</TE>
<TE>   "My sister attends UC Davis, and it's going to be tough,
financially, next year, and we are really going to depend on
scholarships and grants," said Del Pino, who is taking Advanced
Placement classes in physics, calculus and literature and plans to
major in sociology.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Principal Al Weiner said Davis decided to make the
announcement at the west San Fernando Valley campus because of its
diverse student population and nationally recognized humanities
program, and because 93% of its graduates go on to four-year
colleges, community colleges or other postsecondary education
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Our school demonstrates that students from diverse backgrounds
can achieve," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The $118-million program awards $1,000 scholarships to ninth-,
10th- and 11th-grade students who demonstrate high academic
achievement on the statewide Stanford 9 examinations.</TE>
<TE>   Students who score in the top 10% of their class or top 5%
statewide on the Stanford 9 mathematics and English language arts
tests are eligible to claim $1,000 awards.</TE>
<TE>   Awards are held in an interest-bearing account administered by the
ScholarShare Investment Board in the state treasurer's office.</TE>
<TE>   The money may be used to pay fees or tuition at any accredited
postsecondary institution. Students have up to five years to claim

<HD>Death Penalty Urged in Killings</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury recommends execution for Samreth Sam Pan in
Asian street gang slayings. He will be sentenced March 13.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court jury returned a death verdict Thursday
against a member of an Asian street gang that is accused of a 1995
murder rampage stretching from Washington state to Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   Cambodian immigrant Samreth Sam Pan, 25, a member of the Tiny
Rascals gang, was convicted of three killings in Los Angeles County
and Sacramento that prosecutors said were part of the rampage.
Meanwhile, a second jury began deliberations Thursday on the fate of
his co-defendant, Run Peter Chhoun.</LD>
<LD>   Pan and Chhoun, 29, the suspected leader of the gang, were
convicted last week of killing Nghiep Thich Le, 48, and his father,
Hung Dieu Le, 73, of Sacramento during a home invasion, and Miguel
Vargas Avina, 20, of Pomona.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. John Monaghan said Avina was shot as he was
putting a .22-caliber rifle in his truck to go rabbit hunting. He
said Pan and Chhoun mistakenly thought he was a rival gang member.</TE>
<TE>   The two also were convicted of burglarizing and robbing the Le
home and attempting to murder Nghiep Le's wife, Quyen Luu, 49, who
was shot in the thigh.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry scheduled sentencing
for March 13.</TE>
<TE>   Monaghan said the Sacramento and Pomona cases were tried in Los
Angeles in the same courtroom under a law that permits combining
cases that have factors in common. In these cases, he said, the
defendants are in the same gang, used the same weapons and committed
the offenses within a short period of time. The law was designed
primarily to deal with serial murder cases.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to those convictions, Chhoun has been sentenced in San
Bernardino County to death for the August 1995 home invasion murders
of a family of five.</TE>
<TE>   He and Pan also have been convicted and sentenced to life in
prison for the drive-by shooting of a rival gang member, Bunlort Bun,
20, in Muscoy in San Bernardino County the same month.</TE>
<TE>   Chhoun also has been charged with the murders of a Spokane, Wash.,
couple in July 1995.</TE>

<HD>The Challenge of Special Education</HD>
<DH>Schools: The Los Angeles district faces many hurdles as it
moves to integrate students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE and ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gloria Vasquez wakes and dresses her 10-year-old daughter Yvonne each
morning, starting with a fresh diaper. She spoon-feeds breakfast to
the girl, then takes her to the Salvin School for disabled children
in South Los Angeles, where Yvonne is being trained in basic life
skills. She never learned to read.</LD>
<LD>   Milo Howell is an example of a different type of special education
student in the Los Angeles Unified School District. At age 8, he
started classes at a school for the blind. The Granada Hills
youngster at first couldn't read Braille but gradually made such
progress that he transferred to mainstream campuses. He now attends
Glendale Community College and hopes to become a sportscaster or a
psychologist.</LD>
<LD>   When children are labeled as disabled in the Los Angeles school
district, it can mean many things--that they have autism, mental
retardation, deafness, the inability to walk, a learning disability
or an anger-management problem.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, disabled children have a wide range of educational
needs. And meeting those, experts say, will be one of the major
challenges as the Los Angeles school district embarks on a massive
reform of its special education program aimed at integrating as many
disabled youngsters as possible into regular schools.</TE>
<TE>   Some disabled children, such as Yvonne, probably will always need
an aide or even separate classes. Others might need to be pulled out
of regular classes for speech therapy or coordination exercises or
counseling. Still others, such as Howell, might thrive in a regular
classroom with non-disabled youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   Even children with the same disability often have very different
needs.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say that all autistic children should be educated in a
general education classroom, a separate classroom or a segregated
special school," said Paul Mueller, administrative coordinator for
the Los Angeles Unified School District's special education programs.
"It depends on the severity of their disability and the parents'
desires."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 45,000 special education students in Los Angeles
already spend at least part of their school day in mainstream
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Under a recent plan, the result of a federal lawsuit and
investigations, as many as 35,000 other disabled students who are now
attending separate special education schools or segregated all-day
classes could be at least partly integrated into regular schools.</TE>
<TE>   By 2006, the plan requires that disabled students make up 7%
to 17% of nearly every Los Angeles district school, including 16
campuses now devoted wholly to special education.</TE>
<TE>   Many Children</TE>
<TE>   Were Misdiagnosed</TE>
<TE>   The federal investigations found that the district
misdiagnosed many children and often failed to provide adequate resources
to educate them. The probe also revealed that a disproportionate number
of disabled students were isolated from their peers, despite evidence
that disabled children often progress better in regular educational
settings.</TE>
<TE>   But deciding which children are able to handle a regular classroom
and which should be in special programs has always been a difficult
call, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Doing that on a large scale in the more than 660 Los Angeles
district campuses over the next four years won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Disabled children fall into 21 major categories in the district.
Those with learning disabilities, such as attention-deficit disorder,
are the largest group by far, about 60% of all special education
students.</TE>
<TE>   Those with speech problems and mental retardation make up the next
largest categories.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups include autistic, deaf and emotionally disturbed
students, as well as those with "established medical
disabilities"--which could include anything from frequent seizures to
cerebral palsy.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law requires school districts to be extremely flexible,
often at great expense.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan stemming from the lawsuit settlement, disabled
students are supposed to be reevaluated yearly. Others will have
their education programs changed according to their progress. Still
others will join regular classes.</TE>
<TE>   "What we tried to do is provide a continuum of options," Mueller
said. "On that continuum, you might have a child in a general ed
class with some help from an aide. Or no services at all. Or it could
go all the way to private residential facilities where they spend 24
hours a day."</TE>
<TE>   But Mueller conceded that the system broke down in Los Angeles,
where backlogs prevented many children from being reevaluated, and a
lack of resources and adequately trained teachers left many families
with no choice but to send their children to segregated special
education schools.</TE>
<TE>   Special education accounts for $1billion annually, or 20% of L.A.
Unified's budget. Officials have not estimated the additional costs
of the integration plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a problem with resources," Mueller said. "We had
trouble being compliant [with federal law] let alone innovating new
programs."</TE>
<TE>   Many parents of disabled students support the integration plan.
But even a success story like Howell's has a mixed history, according
to his mother, Patty. When her son moved on to mainstream schools, he
did not have enough support there and she had to pay for tutors.</TE>
<TE>   Given the crowding in some public school classrooms, she
wonders how the shift to more integration will affect disabled children:
"What teacher is going to [be able to] give you one on one?"</TE>
<TE>   Mother Frets</TE>
<TE>   About Services</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez says her daughter is dependent on adults for nearly
everything and she hopes that the district changes do not mean fewer
services for children like Yvonne.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez worries that mainstream schools will not have
three nurses, as the Salvin campus does, to take care of Yvonne when she
has seizures. Will there be enough aides to make sure Yvonne takes
her medicine and has her diaper changed?</TE>
<TE>   "I prefer it the way it is. They have attention here," Vasquez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Clark placed her 8-year-old autistic son, Daniel,
in regular classes in third grade at Granada Elementary School in
Granada Hills because she didn't want him to feel different.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't worked out, she says. Some other students are bullying
him.</TE>
<TE>   Clark says the school should have done more to protect her son.
She is considering transferring Daniel to a private school.</TE>
<TE>   Some children "tell him he is different, weird, and he doesn't
know how to handle it," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   "He has no friends at school. He is devastated about that."</TE>

<HD>Compton Schools Chief's Former Bosses Charged</HD>
<DH>Law: Las Cruces, N.M., board is accused of illegal
payments to Jesse Gonzales. He refuses to return the money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Mexico attorney general Thursday charged current and former
school board members in Las Cruces with illegally granting raises and
benefits to Compton Superintendent Jesse Gonzales when he headed the
schools there.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzales, who was not charged with anything, was superintendent in
Las Cruces for nearly 12 years before leaving late last year to
assume the top job in Compton. Through a spokesman, he declined to
comment.</LD>
<LD>   In a previous interview and in documents submitted to The Times, a
lawyer for Gonzales said that the board was responsible for approving
raises and that Gonzales had accepted them "in good faith" as
gestures recognizing his "excellent work."</LD>
<TE>   Gonzales' accomplishments in Las Cruces were cited by California
education officials when they decided to return full local authority
to Compton's schools last year after eight years of state management.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal complaints involve misdemeanor violations of New
Mexico's Open Meetings Act. They charge two current board members and
three former members with approving hundreds of thousands of dollars
in extra benefits for Gonzales without making the votes public.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Thompson, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said it was
the first time the state had filed criminal complaints for a
violation of open meetings law.</TE>
<TE>   The board members, while acknowledging their error, have said they
gave Gonzales the benefits to encourage him to turn down offers from
other school districts.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Patricia Madrid, the New Mexico attorney general,
indicated the investigation was continuing but would turn to "civil
enforcement remedies that may be available for returning money
unlawfully spent by these board members."</TE>
<TE>   That is a pointed reference to Gonzales. The Compton
superintendent has refused appeals to return an estimated $390,000 in
raises and benefits he received. He and the Las Cruces board members
also remain under investigation by New Mexico prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   In Compton, school board members have expressed little interest in
news reports of the New Mexico investigations. Last month, the
Compton board unanimously passed a resolution declaring its support
for Gonzales.</TE>

<HD>Davis Works Out Workers' Comp Benefits Hike</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Governor brokers deal that appeals to labor,
his biggest contributors. Businesses criticize it, saying the system
itself unfairly burdens them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has struck a deal with organized labor, trial lawyers
and Democratic lawmakers to raise benefits for injured workers while
also limiting employers' costs for providing workers' compensation,
administration officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement averts an election-year fight between Davis and some
of his major backers, and it's a significant victory for labor and
attorneys who represent injured workers.</LD>
<LD>   Legislation being drafted Thursday would boost benefits for
injured workers from the current $490 a week to $602 starting in
January 2003, and to $840 by 2006. Beyond 2006, benefits would rise
automatically based on the annual percentage that wages increase in
California--a major change long sought by organized labor.</LD>
<TE>   Benefits also would double by 2006 for family members of workers
killed on the job, from the current high of $160,000.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the Department of Industrial Relations estimates that
the benefits package will cost an extra $2.4 billion a year.
Administration officials say the rising costs will be tempered by a
system overhaul that could save businesses $1.5 billion annually.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for a benefit increase," said Stephen Smith, head of
the Department of Industrial Relations and Davis' top labor aide. "We
also needed to get some system reforms. The governor has to take a
close look at the final wording. But we are very encouraged by the
progress we have made."</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate is expected to take up the bill Monday, followed
quickly by the Assembly. Its passage is likely, given that Democrats
hold a significant majority in both houses, and Senate President Pro
Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) is among the leading advocates of a
benefit hike. The bill could arrive on Davis' desk next week.</TE>
<TE>   "We're 49th out of 50 states in how we treat injured workers;
that's just scandalous," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Business Groups Vow</TE>
<TE>   to Oppose Measure</TE>
<TE>   In each of his first three years in office, Davis vetoed bills to
raise workers' comp benefits. After the Democratic governor issued
the veto last year, Burton threatened an initiative, and union
leaders became increasingly angry.</TE>
<TE>   Labor is Davis' single biggest source of campaign money, providing
him a combined $5.5 million in donations since he took office in
1999, or roughly 13.4% of the total he has raised, according to a
Times analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Some business representatives viewed the agreement reached
Thursday as an improvement from past measures that Davis vetoed at
their urging. By reaching the agreement, Davis--as well as businesses
and labor--will avoid what would be a major initiative war in
November, when he must face reelection. The initiative being
contemplated could raise benefits by as much as $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming that the bill is signed, there would be no need for an
initiative," said Tom Rankin of the California Labor Federation, a
major force behind the benefit hike. But while an initiative war will
be averted, business groups vowed to oppose the new legislation, to
be carried by Burton and Assemblyman Tom Calderon (D-Montebello).</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very large hit on employers," said Willie
Washington, lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and Technology
Assn. "We're going to alert our members and put as much pressure on
the Legislature and governor as we can. It is just not acceptable.
We're in a downturn. This will be bury a lot of manufacturers."</TE>
<TE>   Business groups largely were cut out of the negotiations leading
to the agreement, while organized labor leaders and attorneys who
represent injured workers were at the table.</TE>
<TE>   "Not having seen the language," said California Chamber of
Commerce President Allan Zaremberg, "the disparity between the
benefit increases and the savings is very significant and would lead
to additional premium increases, and therefore we are still opposed."</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature last made significant changes to the workers'
compensation program in the mid-1990s. A task force study for
then-Gov. Pete Wilson cited the cost of workers' compensation as a
major reason for business failures in California.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, the report said, the system cost employers $11
billion a year, while Californians hurt on the job were receiving
among the lowest benefits in the nation. After changes to the system,
employer costs dropped to $8 billion. Critics of the Wilson-era
changes say that while employees saved money, injured workers
received only modest increases.</TE>
<TE>   Zaremberg said workers' compensation insurance premiums paid by
employers have jumped 77% since 1997 to almost $12 billion. Overall,
the system is expected to cost $15.2 billion by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   How Would Bill Save</TE>
<TE>   Money for Employers?</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the proposal are aimed at saving money for employers.</TE>
<TE>   The state would use money from taxes levied on workers'
compensation insurance premiums to subsidize employers by paying part
of the wages of injured workers who return to work early. In 2004,
when the state subsidy would begin, the state anticipates spending
about $87 million. However, employers could save $96 million by
having workers return to work early, the administration estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-rising cost of providing medical care, which accounts for
53% of the money spent on workers' comp, also is a target of the
proposal. The Davis administration hopes to expand the use of managed
health care in the workers' comp system, and expects large health
maintenance organizations such as Kaiser to enter the field.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the state plans to develop fee schedules for surgery
and pharmaceuticals commonly used to treat injured employees.
Combined, the changes in health care could save $500 million a year,
according to the Department of Industrial Relations.</TE>
<TE>   The administration believes the biggest cost savings will come
from a change in current law that says the opinion of doctors who
treat injured workers are presumed to be correct. Employers may be
able to find less costly ways of properly treating injured workers.</TE>

<DH>Nobody Is Expecting Any Miracles When '80 Olympians Get
Together Today</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Eruzione hadn't seen so many flags in 22 years. He hadn't
spotted so many stars, noticed so many stripes, since he'd scored the
goal that enabled a band of anonymous American amateurs to defeat the
mighty Soviet hockey team on the way to winning the 1980 Olympic gold
medal.</LD>
<LD>   He was driving from Chicago to his home in Boston, because the
events of Sept. 11 had made flying impossible. He saw the flags and
the red, white and blue banners hanging from buildings, bridges and
freeway overpasses, and shook his head, again and again.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of frustrating," Eruzione says. "Why don't we do this
all the time?</LD>
<TE>   "Why does it take a great victory or a great tragedy to show our
love or our support for our country?"</TE>
<TE>   The flags came out in 1980 after Eruzione and his teammates,
playing the role of no-hope hosts at the Lake Placid Winter Olympics,
had scored one of the most famous upsets in sports history, defeating
the five-time Olympic champion Soviet Union, 4-3, in the semifinals
en route to a stunning gold-medal triumph over Finland.</TE>
<TE>   "Miracle on Ice," it was called. The reference, of course, was to
the utter improbability of victory, but it also could apply to the
cathartic effect one hockey result could have on the mood of a
country.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1980 Winter Olympics, the United States found itself in
a strange place--locked in a stalemate over the fate of 52 American
hostages held captive in Iran, nervous about the Soviet Union's
recent invasion of Afghanistan, dispirited by a stagnant economy,
soaring inflation and a gasoline shortage.</TE>
<TE>   "People were feeling beaten down at that time," says Ken Morrow, a
defenseman for the 1980 U.S. hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   Says Jim Craig, the team's starting goaltender, "America was
questioning if it was still the biggest superpower. I think there was
some real doubt about it."</TE>
<TE>   Craig remembers watching the evening news then.</TE>
<TE>   "You looked at President Jimmy Carter's face and he looked
scared," he says. "Nobody knew what was going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two years later, Craig says he sees some similarities in
the current landscape. Another war in Afghanistan. The U.S. economy
sagging again. A melancholy mood across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, people have felt the same way," he says. "It's so
emotional right now."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Silk, a winger on the 1980 U.S. hockey team, says, "It's not
hard to draw parallels between what's happening in Afghanistan and
[with Osama] bin Laden now and what was happening in Afghanistan with
the Soviets then. There was a common enemy that the country, both
then and now, felt was being unjust to the USA, which banded the
country together.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that also, both then and now, there was somewhat of an
emotional hangover in terms of how the country feels about itself.
Back then, obviously, there were gas prices and inflation and
hostages in Iran and the Soviets invading Afghanistan, the whole
litany of problems. And now we have Sept. 11 and the things going on
that we're facing now.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in both cases, the country could be helped by having a
shot in the arm somehow. Something to boost the collective spirit, I
would say."</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, the country found it in a group of mostly college hockey
players who were given no chance to beat the Soviet Union, and yet
found a way. Twenty-two years later, as the United States prepares to
host another Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, there is considerable
drafting off the 1980 hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the 1980 gold medalists will reassemble in Los Angeles for
a reunion game against a group of recently retired NHL players. .The
game, one of several activities held in association with Saturday's
NHL All-Star game at Staples Center, will be played on NHL FANtasy's
Center Ice Rink at the Los Angeles Convention Center at 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few positive events where you remember exactly
where you were when they happened," says Rob Apatoff, senior vice
president for Allstate Insurance, which is sponsoring the reunion
game. "There are mostly negative events--the John F. Kennedy
assassination, the attack on the World Trade towers. This is one of
the few positive events where people know exactly where they were
when the '80 team won the gold ....</TE>
<TE>   "I think that was truly a start of a renewed sense of patriotism
and people coming back together. I think that's why this has struck
such a chord with people, when they found out the team's getting back
together. It brings them back to a point in time when they felt
really good."</TE>
<TE>   Eruzione, who retired from hockey immediately after the 1980
Olympics, has extended the moment into a profitable career as a
motivational speaker. His bookings include company retreats and
corporate conventions.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are making decisions for corporations today were
at an age in 1980 where they were probably in college or just
starting in their business," he says. "Eventually, they became CEOs.
And they think, 'What person or group could we bring in to talk about
teamwork and togetherness and commitment and overcoming odds?' And
they say, 'Well, I remember when I was in college watching that
hockey team. Let's get one of those guys.'"</TE>
<TE>   He also is a popular interview subject whenever a major sporting
event features one team or participant that is heavily favored over
another, such as Sunday's Super Bowl game between the St. Louis Rams
and New England Patriots. With the Patriots 14-point underdogs,
Eruzione figures he'll get "two or three" phone calls from reporters
this week.</TE>
<TE>   "They ask, 'What advice do you have for them?'" Eruzione says. "I
don't have any advice. Or they'll ask, 'Do they have a chance?'"'</TE>
<TE>   And what does he tell them?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah!" he says with a laugh. "If you get to the Super Bowl, guess
what, you can win. And if you don't think you can win, you don't
belong in the damn game in the first place. That's what I tell
people: Why can't they win? These guys are players; they're talented.</TE>
<TE>   "There has not been a sporting event, since 1980, where the odds
were bigger than the odds against us. The oddsmakers, the experts,
they pick what the numbers supposedly are going to be. Nobody was a
greater underdog than we were. And we won. So that's what I tell
them. 'Guess what. Anything can happen.'"</TE>
<TE>   Except, in all likelihood, another team replicating the Miracle on
Ice.</TE>
<TE>   "Not in the sport of hockey," Craig says. "Not in the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the Olympic hockey tournament has turned pro.
Amateurs have been pushed aside for the current collection of
regionalized NHL all-star teams--the professionals from Canada
against the professionals from Finland, from Sweden, from the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   For another, the Cold War is long past. The Soviet Union has been
dismantled.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the Russians have split up, there's like six teams
they're putting out now," Craig says. "The best players are split up
all over the place. Back then, it was one big team."</TE>
<TE>   Eruzione says, "If there was an amateur hockey team that went to
the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City and won a gold medal, it would be
pretty special. But again, the Soviets are not our enemies anymore.
So there's not the Cold War aspect of the games as there was in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Taliban had a soccer team and played our men's team and we
were super underdogs and we won, boy, that would create some kind of
a nationalistic pride. But there's no enemy out there in ice hockey
today."</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen of the 20 players on the 1980 Olympic team went on to
play in the NHL. Morrow won four Stanley Cup championships with the
New York Islanders. Center Neal Broten scored more than 900 points in
the NHL. All long retired now, they have settled into middle age,
with careers in real estate, the stock market, banking and teaching.
Only three are still involved in hockey--Morrow as the director of
pro scouting for the Islanders, defenseman Mike Ramsey as an
assistant coach with the Minnesota Wild and winger John Harrington as
the hockey coach at St. John's University in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, today's reunion game represents something of a
physical and emotional challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be surprised if more than three or four guys played
regularly," says Silk, who works for Putnam Investments and teaches
management classes at his alma mater, Boston University. "There might
be a couple guys that play in some sort of pickup hour."</TE>
<TE>   Silk is not one, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been carbo-loading since about 1993," he jokes. "So I think
I've got that covered. And I'll probably take a walk around the block
with my dog or my wife and that'll be the extent of my training."</TE>
<TE>   Silk has participated in similar reunion games over the years,
usually against teams of celebrities or NHL alumni. It's a good time
to be had with old friends, he says, so long as you don't pay close
attention to the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually get killed," he says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "One time we were playing in Philadelphia and they were beating us
about five-nothing after about 10 minutes of the game. And one of the
guys on the other team's bench said, 'Boy, now I know why they called
it Miracle on Ice.'"</TE>

<HD>Staples Doesn't Need Tyson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simple question: Would you invite Mike Tyson to your house?</LD>
<LD>   Didn't think so.</LD>
<LD>   But Staples Center President Tim Leiweke is ready to welcome Tyson
to an arena near you if the California State Athletic Commission
grants him a license.</LD>
<TE>   Which is to say, if our state is ready to sink below Nevada on the
integrity scale. If that's the case, we might as well have the Big
One hit now and turn Laughlin into beachfront property.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't Las Vegas used to be the place for old Tinseltown stars who
had lost their luster?</TE>
<TE>   Now we want to accept their boxing rejects?</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada State Athletic Commission turned down Tyson and turned
its back on a megamillion dollar windfall from a Tyson-Lennox Lewis
fight when it denied Tyson a boxing license Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Say what you want about the Nevada commissioners, but you can't
say they sold out. They said "enough," when they could have said "How
much?" New York, another state that needs to fill hotel rooms,
already has said no to Tyson. Tyson's manager Shelly Finkel wants to
try California. If the state says yes, Leiweke sounds ready to
rumble.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming they approve, yes, we would be interested, but it's such
a fluid situation right now," Leiweke told The Times' Steve Springer.</TE>
<TE>   Allow me to dry it up.</TE>
<TE>   No. Uh-uh. Heck no.</TE>
<TE>   Are we clear?</TE>
<TE>   Tim, you don't want any part of this one.</TE>
<TE>   At this point Tyson is nothing more than a circus act. A stale one
at that. Bite, hit late, unleash a profanity-laced tirade. Or mix and
match those elements, as he did at the news conference last week to
promote the originally scheduled fight with Lewis at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   I'm still stunned that the folks at the MGM Grand would even let
Tyson set foot in their building again. In the chaos that followed
Tyson's ear bite against Evander Holyfield, fights broke out and a
gun shot was reportedly heard. Security shut down the casino and
cleared it out.</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine how much money it cost MGM to have its casino out
of business on a Saturday night in a big fight weekend?</TE>
<TE>   For a building that has been open less than 21/2 years, Staples
Center already has hosted more than its share of memorable events.
Two Laker NBA championships. The De La Hoya-Mosley fight. Jennifer
Lopez showing up at the Grammy Awards in "The Dress." The Kings'
memorable comeback against the Detroit Red Wings. The U.S. Figure
Skating Championships.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL All-Star game is Saturday. March brings the return of the
Pacific 10 Conference basketball tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The venue isn't hurting for attention. Tyson would bring the wrong
kind.</TE>
<TE>   Staples has survived two fights without major incidents. Why push
it with this high-risk guy?</TE>
<TE>   There's also the matter of logistics. The Kings have a home game
April 6, the original date for the Tyson-Lewis fight. The Clippers
are home the next Saturday and the Saturday after that is the first
weekend of the NBA playoffs. Leiweke said the Forum could be used if
Staples Center is unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson shouldn't be allowed to fight in the state. Not the Sports
Arena, not Pauley Pavilion, Arco Arena or the Cow Palace.</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center already has had its bad moments.</TE>
<TE>   Strike one was the violence outside after the Lakers won the
championship in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Strike two was the King fans throwing debris on the ice to protest
the officiating last Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Only Tyson has the multi-sports-metaphor potential to deliver a
knockout blow and a third strike on the same night.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want the next batch of "Tyson is nuts" stories to carry a
Los Angeles dateline.</TE>
<TE>   I thought part of the appeal of hosting major events was to
promote the city. We'd be better off with a nationally televised
freeway chase. At least those showcase the good weather. Money?
Staples Center barely broke even on the De La Hoya-Mosley fight.
Tyson-Lewis could be the most lucrative fight in history, but how
much of the profits will have to be plowed back into extra security?
Not to keep the venue safe from terrorists, but to protect everyone
from Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   The state wouldn't even get its just due if, as was the case with
De La Hoya and Mosley, it reached an agreement to give the promoters
a tax break because Staples can't match the eight-figure site fees
put up by casinos.</TE>
<TE>   We don't want this fight.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's another question: Does Tyson even want the fight?
Everything before and after the hearing indicates he doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Before signing the contract, he had said that he needed a couple
of more warm-up fights before he was ready for Lewis. Then he went
whacko at the news conference, which some longtime Tyson observers
said was his way of trying to back out.</TE>
<TE>   After his license was denied Tuesday, he said that he didn't want
to bother with the hearing in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I was going to get licensed, but Shelly Finkel was
forcing me to come anyway," Tyson said.</TE>
<TE>   If he isn't motivated to argue his case with millions on the
table, how motivated can he be to step in the ring?</TE>
<TE>   Tyson's afraid. And if he isn't, he should be. His boxing skills
look worse with every match. He no longer wins on intimidation. And
the Lewis who beat Hasim Rahman in November would destroy Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis fought big that night at Mandalay Bay. He used his size, he
controlled the ring, he dropped heavy shots on Rahman.</TE>
<TE>   It appears Tyson thinks that his only chance to beat Lewis is to
make him afraid. You have no choice but to fear crazy. You don't want
to step in the ring with crazy. Tyson wants Lewis to enter the fight
thinking: "What's this guy going to do to me? Will he bite? Spit in
my eye?"</TE>
<TE>   If Leiweke keeps lobbying for this fight, I wouldn't want to step
in the ring with him. He'd have to be nuts.</TE>

<DH>Speedskating: For his second Olympics, Smith knows the
drill and wants to win some hardware.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Would you buy a power saw from this man?</LD>
<LD>   Wearing a crisp, orange Home Depot apron with black lettering that
reads, "Hi, I'm Rusty, I Help in All Departments," Rusty Smith is in
earnest conversation with a customer at the Huntington Beach home
improvement haven. Blond-highlighted head nodding, Smith discusses
the virtues of various power tools before he sends the satisfied
do-it-yourselfer back out into the world.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, of Sunset Beach, is actually making a cameo appearance at
the store where he worked for three months last summer. When he got
back, his locker had been given away and his apron stuffed into
someone else's cubbyhole because he had been gone so long, training
to qualify for the U.S. Olympic short-track speedskating team at the
Salt Lake City Winter Games.</LD>
<TE>   Smith gets a new apron before he heads out to the sales floor for
a TV interview, zigzagging through aisles of trash bins, wrenches and
screen doors. Although thrumming with restlessness, he pauses every
few feet to greet co-workers. A 1997 graduate of Huntington Beach's
Ocean View High, no more than an extension cord's length away, Smith
is on home turf.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything new I don't know about?" he asks a cashier, who fills
him in on who's dating whom and who got engaged since his last visit.</TE>
<TE>   "Rusty's a great kid. He makes everyone enthusiastic about the
Olympics," co-worker Shannon Butler says. "We're all really excited.
He's got an incredible personality. Everybody is so glad to see him
when he comes in."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Crowe, a fellow sales associate, praises Smith's way with
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "He could sell you the right drill," Crowe says.</TE>
<TE>   Smith gives Crowe an oversized business card, imprinted on the
back with the skater's age, job title and competitive record. Crowe
asks Smith to sign the front, where he's pictured in his apron.</TE>
<TE>   "I got his autograph in case he wins," Crowe says. "Otherwise,
it'll sit in a drawer."</TE>
<TE>   With any luck, Smith will bring home some gold, silver or bronze
hardware.</TE>
<TE>   He has the talent. At the 1998 Nagano Games, he finished 13th in
the 1,000 meters and was part of the sixth-place 5,000-meter relay
team that set a U.S. record in 7 minutes 2.014 seconds. He was eighth
overall in the 2001 World Short Track Championships, sharing gold in
the 5,000-meter relay besides finishing fourth in the 1,000 and fifth
in the 3,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the Olympic trials in December, Smith earned berths in the 500,
1,000 and 1,500 and the 5,000-meter relay, as did Apolo Anton Ohno.
According to the International Skating Union, Smith has the
seventh-best time ever in the 500 (41.691 seconds), 20th-best in the
1,000 (1:27.825) and third-best in the 1,500 (2:13.893). He recorded
all three at the trials on the fast Olympic Oval.</TE>
<TE>   His coach, Dutch-born Wilma Boomstra, says Smith, 22, routinely
clocks world-record times in training.</TE>
<TE>   "If he races the way he skates in practices, then he's top three
in the world right now," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't always happen. In a World Cup race at Calgary
this season, he slipped while on a world-record pace in the 500. He
also crashed out of the 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the head," Boomstra says. "He skates the fastest lap
times in the world, but racing is a totally different thing than the
practices. He never falls in practices. He falls in races. That's
definitely mental. It can't be anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Ahlke agrees. He's co-president of the Southern California
Speedskating Assn., which has helped further Smith's career, and he
bought Smith's first pair of speedskates.</TE>
<TE>   "At the last Olympics, in practices he was skating the fastest
times in the world," says Ahlke, a contractor who competes in over-40
races. "Other coaches from around the world would come with
stopwatches and say, 'Who is he?' But things just didn't go his way
again. He fell, he got [disqualified]. It was a bad deal. This time
he's matured a lot. He's not going to get pushed around like last
time."</TE>
<TE>   Nor will he be pushed around off the ice. Responding to an
accusation by former teammate Tommy O'Hare more than a week after the
trials that Smith and Ohno had fixed a race to freeze out O'Hare and
help Shani Davis qualify, Smith sued O'Hare for defamation.
Arbitrator James Holbrook found no evidence of a fix and said skaters
who had submitted affidavits saying they'd heard Smith and Ohno
conspire "were admittedly inaccurate." Holbrook exonerated Smith,
Ohno and Davis; O'Hare withdrew his complaint, and Smith dropped his
suit.</TE>
<TE>   The distraction was another bump in a road pocked with potholes.</TE>
<TE>   The son of divorced parents, Smith comes from a working-class
family. His father, Gail, manages an apartment building in Venice
Beach and his mother, Paula, lives in Winnipeg, Canada. Since he has
no place of his own, when he's in town he stays in a basement
apartment at the Newport Beach home owned by Ahlke and Ahlke's wife
Lisa. They're custodians of the medals and ribbons he jams in a white
canvas bag, which he dumps onto a table at a visitor's request.</TE>
<TE>   "You're proud of it for the first week, then it's on to the next
competition," he says of his prizes. "If you don't, you're going to
sit back and look at everything you've done, not what you're going to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Ahlke believes Smith needs only a break at Salt Lake City to add
to that pile.</TE>
<TE>   "Short-track speedskating is highly competitive," Ahlke says.
"Just because you're the fastest skater doesn't mean you're going to
win. You could get boxed out."</TE>
<TE>   Smith sounds ready to combat anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect one medal. I expect multiple medals. Without a
doubt," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Our relay team has an extremely good chance to win silver or gold
and then, individually, I'd like one, but I can see two. The 500 and
1,000 are my best. The 1,500 is my worst distance and I'm ranked top
six in the world. I shouldn't say it's bad. It's just harder for me
to do."</TE>
<TE>   The experience of having competed at the Nagano Games, he hopes,
will help him clear any psychological hurdles at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "The first one was an incredible thrill," he says. "With the
second one, now I have another goal that I have to accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   Smith grew up in north Long Beach, near the Paramount skating
rink. His mother took him to a public skating session one day when he
was a preteen, and he proved a natural.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing him fly around the ice, a speedskater named Bob Nelson
asked his mother how long he had been skating, and was astonished to
hear it was his first day. Nelson asked if he wanted to try
speedskating, which he did two days later.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed myself, and that's the reason I went back, but it
wasn't an instant success," he says. "It was fun, so I did it. It's
exciting. There's more to it than, say, skiing. There's strategy
involved. People don't see it right away.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fairly lucky. I knew what to do. I've always known how to
do it. That's one of the reasons I enjoy it as much as I do."</TE>
<TE>   At 15, he was accepted into the U.S. Olympic Committee's resident
training program and moved to Lake Placid, N.Y. A year later, he made
the junior national team and in 1996 advanced to the senior national
team.</TE>
<TE>   He went back and forth between Southern California and upstate New
York for three years. He then was invited to live at the USOC
training center in Colorado Springs, Colo., where he works for Home
Depot when his training schedule permits.</TE>
<TE>   For putting in 20 hours a week, Smith gets full benefits, medical
and dental coverage and stock options. He also makes promotional
appearances, and rode on Home Depot's float in the Rose Parade. The
money comes in handy: His boots cost $1,600 and blades cost $250 a
pair--and he goes through five pairs a year. The USOC and U.S.
Speedskating, the sport's national governing body, also give him
stipends.</TE>
<TE>   He tries to return to Southern California once a month to work
with Boomstra and to see his older brother, JD. He also tries to
catch up with friends, often while surfing. He calls the water off
Huntington Beach "my new native habitat" and loves the sport, though
he has difficulty finding a wetsuit because he has the thick thighs
of skaters and cyclists. He's 5 feet 8 and 160 pounds, much of that
muscular legs.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to get a special size wetsuit," he says. "The stomach is so
baggy, half the ocean is in my wetsuit.... I know what to do in a
minimal way. Surfing is just a hobby. It's relaxing and enjoyable. I
wouldn't mind being better at it."</TE>
<TE>   Being the best at Salt Lake City is what matters to him now.</TE>
<TE>   His father and mother and their significant others are going, and
his brother is taking a group of friends in an RV. The Ahlkes will be
there too.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I don't embarrass them," Smith says.</TE>
<TE>   Not likely.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely has medal potential," Boomstra says. "It's so
elusive. He tenses up a little too much. It's getting a lot better.
He's racing a lot better than he was. Before, he was too tight. He
still has a little way to go, but I think he can do it."</TE>
<TE>   To Smith, the only problem is dividing his medals among his family
and the Ahlkes.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I have to get more than one," he says. "I've seen it
in my mind. I see it all the time when I'm on the ice. I've seen how,
if I'm in fourth place, how I'll move to second. I know exactly in my
mind what I have to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing is not an option."</TE>

<HD>This Pit-Fall Turns Pitiful for Bruins</HD>
<DH>College basketball: First-place Oregon gets off to a fast,
loud start and never looks back in 91-62 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>What could possibly be greener than 9,000 Oregon fans packed into
McArthur Court?</LD>
<LD>   UCLA floundering on the floor like a team that had never
encountered a loud crowd and an energized opponent.</LD>
<LD>   Or Coach Steve Lavin's face, watching the sickening spectacle of
the Bruins falling behind by 24 in the first half, 35 in the second
and losing, 91-62, Thursday night to fall two games behind the Ducks
and USC in the Pacific 10 Conference race.</LD>
<TE>   The 13th-ranked Bruins have three senior starters and a two-time
all-conference junior in their starting lineup, but they were like
high school freshmen at their first dance--self-conscious and
flustered.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lack of poise and they were on fire," forward Jason
Kapono said.</TE>
<TE>   It was UCLA's worst defeat against Oregon, eclipsing the 56-30
loss here the first time the teams met in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   And of greater importance, , it was the Bruins' fourth loss in
their last six conference games.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono made his only field goal with 20 seconds left in the first
half and finished with four points, his lowest total since scoring
four at Arizona a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Barnes was just as cold, making one of nine shots, scoring
three points and and missing all three of his three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Bruins were shut out from three-point range--missing
13--until Ryan Walcott made one with five minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   "We never established a rhythm offensively and we showed no
intensity on defense," Lavin said. "We didn't give ourselves a chance
to even be competitive, let alone win."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (16-5, 8-2) improved to 12-0 at home with astonishing ease.
Everyone got into the act. Luke Jackson was the only starter who did
not make at least three field goals in the first half and he made two
three-pointers in the first three minutes of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Frederick Jones scored 28 points and the other four
starters also finished in double figures. Chris Christoffersen, the
Ducks' 7-foot-2 center, had 15 rebounds. Oregon shot 56.7%, including
45.5% from three-point range, both the best numbers for an opponent
against UCLA this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Our players were so intense and locked in, we got on them early,"
Jackson said. "We just contained them, got stops, then went down and
scored."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing went right for UCLA (14-6, 6-4) from the opening tip. Each
starter missed a shot in the first four minutes and Oregon zipped to
a 14-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   With the student section about three feet from the court and fans
in the top bleachers seemingly hanging over the floor, falling behind
is like soliciting your mother-in-law's opinion of your new sports
car--it's asking for an earful.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything you do, our crowd will let you know about it," Jackson
said. "You miss a shot, you'll hear about it. We make a shot, they
let us know they appreciate us."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA showed life only for a short time in the second half, going
to a full-court press and making a 12-point run that reduced a
35-point deficit to 69-46. T.J. Cummings scored eight of his 15
points during the spurt.</TE>
<TE>   But two putbacks by Christoffersen and a dunk by Jones off an
alley-oop pass from Luke Ridnour got the crowd going again. Lavin
responded by emptying the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "They had the intensity of a team playing for the Pac-10
championship," UCLA guard Rico Hines said. "They beat us to loose
balls, they fed off the crowd. And we just did not respond."</TE>
<TE>   So UCLA, picked to finish first in a Pac-10 preseason poll, is in
sixth place. Oregon, picked to finish sixth, is in first.</TE>
<TE>   The only silver lining is the realization that UCLA lost here in
1995--and went on to win the national championship. Same with Arizona
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Some very good teams have been buried at this 75-year-old building
that sits hard by a graveyard. But few have put up less of a fight.</TE>
<TE>   In a somber locker room, UCLA center Dan Gadzuric sat motionless,
his head bowed low, tears welling in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Two lockers over, Barnes put into words what Gadzuric felt.</TE>
<TE>   "They beat us in every aspect of the game," he said. "We're not
where we need to be to win the Pac-10. Not offensively or
defensively. Not in terms of intensity. Not in team camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not even close."</TE>

<HD>In L.A., Bowman, Quinn Will Meet Again</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time the NHL held its All-Star game in Los Angeles, in 1981,
Scotty Bowman had left the bench before the start of the season to be
general manager of the Buffalo Sabres.</LD>
<LD>   Bowman, however, coached the Wales Conference team against Pat
Quinn's Campbell Conference team in the 1981 All-Star game, which was
played at the Forum. In the days leading up to the game, Bowman told
reporters that he hoped it would be the last game he coached.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-one years later, Bowman is still coaching, in Detroit, and
he will face Quinn, of Toronto, again in Saturday's 52nd All-Star
game at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "I enjoy the job," Bowman said. "The toughest part when a player
finishes playing is not all the events as much as the camaraderie.
They all say the same thing. It's just that they are so used to being
with the teammates during the hockey season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like that for a coach too. You are used to getting in a
routine and going down to the rink and practicing or a game or
whatever it might be, so that keeps you going. You don't really have
much time when you are a coach to sit back and say, you know, it is
time to do something else right now. You are just thinking. I think
you are thinking of your team probably when you are sleeping too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NHL All-Star weekend will kick into high gear tonight with the
YoungStars Game and SuperSkills Competition starting at 6 at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's high-scoring rookies Dany Heatley and Ilya Kovalchuk
will be among the 24 players taking part in the YoungStars game,
which will feature NHL players under 25 years old.</TE>
<TE>   King broadcaster Jim Fox will coach against former King coach and
current ESPN broadcaster Barry Melrose in a game that will feature
four-on-four play in three 10-minute periods.</TE>
<TE>   The skills competition will start following the game and include
various team and individual events. Players divided into World and
North American All-Star teams will compete in puck control and
breakaway relays, fastest skater, hardest shot, accuracy and passing
events.</TE>
<TE>   The accuracy event should be wide open this year with future hall
of fame defenseman Ray Bourque now retired. Bourque finished at least
tied for first the last five years.</TE>

<HD>Swallows Could Set Price for Ishii</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the biggest obstacles to an agreement between the Dodgers and
pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii has been the difficulty of determining the
value of a highly touted left-hander who has nine years of big league
experience in Japan but has not pitched an inning in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   But one team has established a market for Ishii. The Yakult
Swallows, Ishii's Japanese team, offered a five-year contract that
guaranteed Ishii more than $17 million, a baseball source said and
his agent confirmed. That was the Swallows' last offer before the
Dodgers posted an $11.26-million bid for Ishii's negotiating rights
in early January.</LD>
<LD>   The Yakult offer appears to be the measuring stick for
negotiations with the Dodgers, an indication the team and Ishii may
be further apart than previously reported. The sides have until Feb.
8 to complete a deal, and if Ishii doesn't sign with the Dodgers, he
will resume negotiations with Yakult.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a number he needs to get to in order to come here, and
that's the total value of the contract with Yakult," said Ishii's
agent, Joe Urbon. "We're not necessarily looking for a three-year
deal. We're looking for total value."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' last offer was believed to be for three years and $8
million. Several published reports had Urbon seeking a three-year
deal in the $12-million to $14-million range, which would be
comparable to the three-year, $14.5-million deal Ichiro Suzuki signed
with Seattle last winter. But $7 million of Suzuki's contract is
being deferred, which significantly decreases the average annual
value of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   After signing Kevin Brown to a seven-year, $106.5-million contract
and Darren Dreifort to a five-year, $55.4-million contract and losing
both to elbow injuries last season, the Dodgers seem reluctant to go
more than three years on a pitcher, but it's possible they could add
one or two option years to a three-year deal for Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout negotiations, Urbon has asked the Dodgers why they
would expect Ishii to sign for anything less than he has been
guaranteed in his home country. But it is unclear whether the Yakult
bid is a standing offer that will remain on the table if Ishii can't
come to terms with the Dodgers. The Dodgers, according to a source,
believe the Yakult offer to be far less than $17 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We've thought all along this could go to the end, and if we have
to use every bit of the 30-day window [to sign Ishii], that's what
we'll use," Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said. He declined to
comment on specifics of the negotiations.</TE>

<HD>Gary Bettman</HD>
<DH>NHL Commissioner Takes On the Issues, Including League's
Link to Olympics</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Bettman, who became the NHL's first commissioner nine years ago
today, has had an active tenure. He brought a badly needed business
sense to the league but has been criticized for supposedly not having
a feel for the game. During his reign, two teams left Canada--the
cradle of hockey--and the NHL has expanded or transferred teams to
non-traditional cities in the Sunbelt and West. Player salaries have
more than tripled, to an average of about $1.4 million, but the NHL
in 1994-95 experienced its first prolonged work stoppage, a 102-day
lockout.</LD>
<LD>   And under Bettman's leadership, the NHL for the first time halted
play to allow players to represent their homelands in the 1998
Olympic hockey tournament at Nagano, taking a 17-day hiatus. For the
Salt Lake City Winter Games, it will take a 12-day break starting
Feb. 14. The Olympics will be often discussed during this weekend's
All-Star activities, which Bettman estimated will touch 200,000
people.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a real buzz around this game because it's a good
jumping-off point, both for the second half of the season and for the
Olympics," Bettman said.</LD>
<TE>   Here are excerpts from an interview Bettman did with The Times:</TE>
<TE>   Q: At this point, everybody is looking to the Olympics and the
Olympic teams. The relationship between the NHL and the Olympics--is
it beneficial? Not beneficial? How would you describe it?</TE>
<TE>   A: We go to the Olympics because this is a sport that has a great
history and tradition of international competition dating back to the
Canada Cups [tournaments in the 1970s] and because our fans and our
players like it.</TE>
<TE>   I saw a piece of research that said something like 80% of what I'd
call our strong fans think going to the Olympics is a good thing to
do. We think that by working with the International Ice Hockey
Federation to make this a reality and putting the best hockey players
in the world on the world stage representing their countries, we will
continue together to grow the game.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about your owners [who were lukewarm about the first
Olympic participation]? How do they feel?</TE>
<TE>   A: More owners than not think this is a good thing to do. Even the
owners that have concerns understand the reasons for doing it, and so
we do it because on balance it appears to be the right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does the NHL's agreement go beyond this Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   A: We're going to do this Olympics and we're going to do a World
Cup in the summer of '04.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Would any participation in the next Olympics be part of the
next collective bargaining agreement?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have made it a practice to deal with our Olympic and World
Cup schedule as ongoing discussions. And when I get asked the
question now, 'Will we do it again?' it's the same question I got
asked four years ago before the Olympics and I said when we finish
the cycle [of the Olympics and World Cup] we will sit with the
players' association and reason together as to what we want to do
next. Although my guess is we're going to have to make a decision on
the [2006] Olympics before '04 because we'll need more time. We have
to go through the experience, decompress and then make a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some of the procedures and some of the details of your Olympic
participation this time around are different from four years ago. The
shorter break .... Was that strictly because of the travel?</TE>
<TE>   A: The travel enabled it to happen, but we decided we wouldn't be
comfortable with a break of more than 12 days and so this break is
the outer parameters of what we were prepared to do.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And in terms of greater access to the [Olympic] village [which
NHL officials lacked in 1998 and couldn't head off bad publicity
after the trashing of a dorm room by U.S. players], and greater NHL
involvement?</TE>
<TE>   A: There's a greater understanding on all sides as to what's
involved from the other side, and so I think we were able to work
together and meet those needs, not the least of which, for example,
was PR access....</TE>
<TE>   Q: When people think of the NHL's first involvement at Nagano,
they think of the U.S. hockey players and the room damage.</TE>
<TE>   A: I think that's an unfair overgeneralization. I think when some
people think of it, they may think of that, but I don't think that's
first and foremost in everyone's minds. Chris Chelios was quoted in
the last week saying it was unfortunate, it was regrettable, they
wished it didn't happen, but it's behind them, and I think that's the
end of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Q: For a lot of people it's not, because nobody ever took blame.</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, the team as a whole took blame and made restitution [in a
$3,000 check Chelios sent to Japanese Olympic officials], but I'm not
going to continue an ongoing debate on this. For better or for worse,
it is behind us.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Traditionally, the All-Star break is a time to assess where the
league stands. What are your thoughts on the league's status
competitively, financially and in terms of labor issues?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have labor peace, and we will until at least [Sept. 15]
2004, so that is something that isn't imminently on the radar screen.
We have ongoing discussions with the players' association on a whole
host of issues.... The state of the league, at this point, I think
we're having a very good season in a number of respects.
Competitively, night in and night out the games are close, the games
are meaningful. You look at the standings, every game matters. And
for a sport with a 1,230-game regular season, the fact that last
season and the season before a point or two, a game, if you will,
could make the difference in making the playoffs or not, the
significance of our regular season has never been more apparent.</TE>
<TE>   Not withstanding the recession and the overall climate, attendance
is up. It's up 1%, and that's off of a fourth year in a row record
pace.... Last weekend we had 21 games, 19 were sold out and we played
to 99.9% of capacity. Our ratings on ABC are up 36% for the first two
games. We've been very successful in renewing sponsorships over the
last few months despite what many have described as a difficult
economy.... And so the interest in our game is tremendous.I've seen a
lot written about [decreased] scoring. I believe we're down.... We've
scored about 4,000 goals this season already. I think we're down less
than 200, which amounts to one goal maybe once every four games. On
balance, would I rather see scoring up a little as opposed to down a
little? The answer is yes. But I wouldn't put this anything near the
concern or crisis category. Obviously, it's something we'll talk
about with the general managers when they meet in March, but I don't
think that's in any respect a bellwether for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Going back to the 99.9% capacity you spoke about last weekend
... that's close to the capacity the Anaheim Mighty Ducks played to
the first three or four years of their existence, and now they're
obviously far below that.</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe in this era of sports and entertainment involving
fragmentation, a host of options for leisure time and leisure
dollars, ticket prices, that performance over time can affect
attendance. But what you look to long term is ownership, market and
building, and in all three, the Mighty Ducks are more than fine. And
it will come back.</TE>
<TE>   Q: We've talked in the past about the growth of salaries vs. the
growth of revenues. Where does that stand?</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe when we complete the season, and obviously we're in
midstream so I can't be definitive about this, I believe this will be
a season when salaries grew faster than revenues, and I don't view
that as a positive sign. But again, when the time comes, we'll look
at what we need from an economic system going forward, and we'll work
toward making sure we have a system where all of our teams can be
healthy and competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Herb Brooks, coach of the U.S. Olympic hockey team, suggested
several months ago that for the benefit of Olympic preparation that
the All-Star game should be scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   A: Statements like that, and the suggestion this is a burden on
the players, is really without foundation or unfair. People assume
when they make that statement that if we didn't have an All-Star game
the players would have the time off. Twelve teams have four days off,
I believe and 18 teams have five days and in that period, there's an
exhibition game. If we weren't having the All-Star weekend, we'd be
playing regular-season games, and everybody would be playing either
two or three games.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So there would have been no Olympic break for Olympic teams to
get together?</TE>
<TE>   A: We were taking a 12-day break for the Olympics, nothing more.
We had had discussions with the players' association about turning
this into a weekend with a series of exhibition games [among Olympic
teams] and Olympic prep and the players' association told us that
wasn't anything the players were interested in.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you see any growth in the league beyond 30 teams?</TE>
<TE>   A: That is not something we've given any thought to in the short
term, at least, and short term is a number of years. We have to make
sure we have the right economic system in place so that all 30 of our
clubs are healthy and competitive.</TE>

<HD>Cronkite's Opinion May Not Fly in Las Vegas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Kindred, writing in the Sporting News: "Walter Cronkite believes
the wonderful thing about the Super Bowl is that so many people can
get together in a common cause for 'something that means absolutely
nothing.'</LD>
<LD>   "As wise as Uncle Walter always is, he must know nothing about any
football coach. To say the game means nothing is to say the Lombardis
and Landrys, the Shanahans and Johnsons, do work that is meaningless.</LD>
<LD>   "'If a carpenter builds a house and it falls down, do you say,
"It's only a house"?' Joe Paterno once asked. The coach asked the
question because his Penn State football team had lost an important
game and someone suggested he shouldn't take the defeat to heart
because, after all, it is only a game."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Super Bowl record for yards gained
rushing in a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Very bad taste: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe, writing from
New Orleans: "Super Bowl media day is preposterous. Players are
forced to be available for an hour and it's soon clear why they think
most members of the media are morons.</TE>
<TE>   "Decades ago, the ultimate media day question was posed by a dolt
who asked Jim Plunkett, 'Jim, let me get this straight--is it your
mother who is dead and your dad who is blind, or is it the other way
around?'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It stays with you: Marv Levy coached the Buffalo Bills to four
consecutive Super Bowls--all defeats. He's a broadcaster with Fox
television now after retiring as a coach. Aaron Kuriloff of the New
Orleans Times-Picayune asked him about his Super Bowl experience:
"There's no devastation worse than losing the game. Even though you
feel the great exhilaration when you win and great despair when you
lose, the exhilaration never exceeds the intensity of the despair."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fun guy: Rick Morrissey in the Chicago Tribune: "How dull is Bill
Belichick? I'm glad you asked. Cadavers pick up cell phones and
pretend to be in deep conversation whenever the Patriots' coach
approaches. At rave parties, Belichick has been known to say, 'What
does a guy have to do to get a game of Yahtzee going around here?'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Extra benefit: From the Caught on the Fly column in the Sporting
News: "Fly's pal Jason Kapono had this take when Arizona State
nickelheads tossed coins on the court during a(nother) loss to UCLA:
'I saw a quarter, a nickel and a dime. I could have made 40 cents,
but it probably would have been an NCAA violation.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mat motive: The University of Minnesota wrestling team wants to
break a national attendance record today when it meets perennially
strong Iowa at Target Center, which holds 19,000. The record
attendance for a wrestling match is 15,291, set in Iowa City when
Iowa and Iowa State met in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Timmy Smith of the Washington Redskins, 204 yards
against Denver in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: It has been reported that the Rams once traded nine
players for Ollie Matson. But that isn't an NFL record. The record
trade was also made by the Rams in 1952--11 players and draft choices
to Dallas for linebacker Les Richter.</TE>
<TE>   After two years in the service, Richter, an All-American at
California, joined the Rams in 1954 and played nine seasons before
retiring.</TE>

<HD>No. 3 Maryland Shows It Knows How to Finish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juan Dixon said the impetus for No. 3 Maryland's stunning comeback
victory against No. 8 Virginia came at the least likely time--when
the Cavaliers thought they had the game won.</LD>
<LD>   Just over six minutes remained, and with Virginia having taken a
four-point lead, Maryland Coach Gary Williams called a timeout, the
crowd whipping into a frenzy as the Cavaliers triumphantly headed for
the bench.</LD>
<LD>   But Keith Jenifer and Travis Watson of Virginia stopped on their
way to say something to Williams, leaving him incensed and his team
determined.</LD>
<TE>   "They thought they had the win," Dixon said of Jenifer and Watson,
"so I guess they wanted to show off a little bit. We wanted to
protect our coach and we allowed that to motivate us and took it from
there."</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins fell even further behind, trailing by nine with 3:22
left, but scored 17 of the last 21 points, finally taking the lead on
Dixon's running one-hander with 31 seconds left, and getting a 91-87
victory at Charlottesville, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The game marked only the second time in 156 meetings that both
teams came into the game ranked in the Top 10, and both played like
it.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia took its big lead by scoring seven consecutive points,
but Drew Nicholas made his only two field goals of the game, both
three-point baskets, and the Terrapins went four of five from the
free-throw line at the end to clinch it.</TE>
<TE>   Byron Mouton led Maryland (17-3, 7-1 Atlantic Coast Conference)
with 21 points, Dixon had 16 and Lonny Baxter had 14 points and 10
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Mason Jr. had 29 points for the Cavaliers (14-4, 4-4) and
Watson had 19 points and 12 rebounds. Chris Williams added 13 points,
but he missed four free throws and Watson missed three in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Duke 87, North Carolina 58--Mike Dunleavy scored 23 points
and Jason Williams had 18 at Chapel Hill, N.C., as the Blue Devils
became the first opponent to win four consecutive games at the
16-year-old Smith Center.</TE>
<TE>   Duke (19-1, 7-1 ACC), which has won seven consecutive, shot 61% in
the first half and committed only two turnovers in taking a 48-35
lead. Coach Mike Krzyzewski took out his starters with three minutes
left and Duke leading by 35 points.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Morrison had 12 points for the Tar Heels (6-12, 2-6), who
matched a season-high with 25 turnovers and dropped to 1-7 in
January, their worst mark in that month since 1951.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Forward blocks Duncan's last-second shot,
giving the Clippers a 91-87 victory at San Antonio.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>The ball went to Tim Duncan, as everyone inside the Alamodome knew it
would. Duncan went to work on Elton Brand, as 17,288 San Antonio Spur
fans screamed. Duncan faked Brand out of his high tops and launched a
short jump shot that would tie the score and send the game to
overtime.</LD>
<LD>   Except the ball never got to the basket.</LD>
<LD>   Darius Miles swatted Duncan's shot away, Jeff McInnis made two
free throws at the other end and the Clippers held on for a 91-87
victory Thursday that ended a 15-game losing streak to the Spurs.</LD>
<TE>   If the Clippers have proved anything during the first three games
of their seven-game cross-country trip, it's to expect the
unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   They flopped Monday in Memphis, losing to the last-place
Grizzlies. They rebounded Tuesday in Dallas, ending the Mavericks'
seven-game winning streak. They were superb late Thursday in San
Antonio, giving the Spurs their fourth consecutive home loss.</TE>
<TE>   Next stop, Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember the last time we beat these guys in their
place," said center Michael Olowokandi, one of a number of Clipper
standouts. "But we did tonight by sticking with them and pulling it
out at the end. That is becoming a trademark of this team. To keep
fighting like that is becoming commonplace for us."</TE>
<TE>   The trick to winning on the road, which the Clippers did for only
the fifth time in 20 games and the first time in consecutive games
since Feb. 21-22 of last season, is doing the little things right.</TE>
<TE>   For the second consecutive game, the Clippers played suffocating
defense in the fourth quarter. Against Dallas, they outscored the
Mavericks, 35-19, in the fourth. Against San Antonio, they played the
Spurs even in the fourth, each team scoring 22 points. But the
Clippers, who led by four points going into the fourth, held the
Spurs to six-of- 19 shooting (31.6%) in the final 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I was most pleased with was our defense," Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "The footnote to that was that we didn't give up a lot
of second shots."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Spurs outrebounded the Clippers, 13-9, in the fourth
quarter (and by 50-43 for the game), they took only four offensive
rebounds in the final period and had two second-chance points.</TE>
<TE>   A refresher course in Fundamentals of Basketball 101 helped set
the stage for two critical highlight-reel plays for the Clippers in
the game's final minute.</TE>
<TE>   First, leading by 87-85 after Duncan's sweet bank shot, the
Clippers broke San Antonio's press as an alert Olowokandi passed to
an open Brand after Duncan's try for a steal backfired at midcourt.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had to finish it as soon as possible because those
7-footers were right behind me," Brand said of his breakaway dunk
that gave the Clippers an 89-85 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Next, after Terry Porter made two free throws for San Antonio and
McInnis missed a jumper for the Clippers, the Spurs set up a play for
Duncan that could have sent the game into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Miles appeared and saved the game for the Clippers (24-23). Miles
scored only six points while starting for the injured Corey Maggette,
who had been filling in for the injured Lamar Odom.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think you can judge the kid by his stats," Gentry
said.</TE>
<TE>   Miles, a 20-year-old forward, moved smartly to cut off Duncan's
escape route, recording the biggest block of his second NBA season.
Duncan led the Spurs with 23 points and 16 rebounds, but the basket
he didn't make resulted in a deafening silence inside the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew Tim Duncan was going to make a strong move to the
basket and try to get fouled," Miles said. "I knew he wasn't looking
to pass. I took a bit of a gamble by leaving Steve Smith, but it was
a good gamble. That's when I went blindside and got the block. That
was the ball game."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it was difficult to determine the winner of the game
ball. Miles was a strong candidate. Brand had 19 points and 14
rebounds, his 32nd double-double. Olowokandi had 20 points and 12
rebounds. McInnis had 15 points and nine assists. And Quentin
Richardson had 18 points in a reserve role.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great win against an elite team," Gentry said. "We're
starting to believe if we play with confidence and stick together, we
can win on the road."</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>The news from L.A. was not good for the Clippers on Thursday. It
wasn't too good from San Antonio either before the Clippers faced the
Spurs at the Alamodome. Neither of the team's top two small forwards
would be playing.</LD>
<LD>   Lamar Odom had his sprained right wrist examined by Tony Daly, the
Clippers' doctor, in L.A. When Odom's cast was removed Thursday, Daly
discovered there was only "slight progress" and a new target date for
his return was set for one month from today.</LD>
<LD>   Odom, injured Dec. 16 against the Detroit Pistons, has a new cast
on his wrist. He is scheduled to wear it for two weeks, then undergo
another exam with Daly and wear a third cast for one more week.</LD>
<TE>   Corey Maggette sat out the Clippers' victory Thursday and was
uncertain if he could play Saturday against the Atlanta Hawks, the
fourth stop on the team's seven-game trip. Maggette suffered a
strained left knee in Tuesday's victory over the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   Darius Miles replaced Maggette in the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to make any excuses," Coach Alvin Gentry said
when asked about missing Odom and Maggette. "Corey's sitting out and
Lamar is back in L.A., but we're not going to use it as an excuse.
We're going to play and compete with the guys we have and we're not
going to use it as a crutch."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had only 10 sound players Thursday, which was fine
with Gentry. He played only eight in their 91-87 victory.</TE>
<TE>   At game's end, the Clippers gathered around a television in their
locker room to watch the highlights of the Washington Wizards'
last-second victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. They marveled at
Michael Jordan's winning jump shot and wondered how he could be left
so open.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Craig Ehlo?" more than one player asked, referring to the
former Cavalier, who shadowed Jordan unsuccessfully on a long-ago,
frequently replayed, last-second jumper in the playoffs.</TE>

<LD>   What: ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002</LD>
<LD>   Game System: PlayStation 2</LD>
<TE>   Price: $49.99</TE>
<TE>   First, let's be realistic: The best NFL game for this or any other
game system is the Madden game by Electronic Arts. This game,
however, is not a bad alternative.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the basic play modes, exhibition, practice, season,
etc., "ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002" (that title just rolls off the
tongue, doesn't it?) offers a mode that lets you customize the game
to put yourself in classic situations. Also, it has an excellent
Franchise mode.</TE>
<TE>   The Franchise mode lets you pick your favorite team and run it as
coach and general manager through a preseason, the regular season,
the playoffs, the Super Bowl, the Pro Bowl, and the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Once the season begins, you can play your team's game or let the
computer simulate it. And if you choose to simulate the game, you
actually have a lot of control over how the team plays the game in
the simulated contest. You can adjust settings for conservativeness
or aggressiveness of the offense, the run/pass balance, the blitz
frequency, and the frequency of running zone defenses verses tight
man coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the game's best features are in its off-season. After each
year in a franchise, you get to go through the basic stuff--re-sign
players, sign free agents, see retired players, and the rookie draft,
which is where the game really shines.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, "ESPN NFL Prime Time 2002" makes you feel you are
actually participating in the NFL.</TE>

<HD>Kings to Retire Gretzky's Number</HD>
<DH>Hockey: As part of two-day celebration, all-time leading
scorer's No. 99 will be raised to Staples Center wall at next
season's home opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wayne Gretzky has received  many honors since he retired as a player
after  the 1998-99 season, and he'll get another very special one at
the start of next season when the Kings retire his No. 99.</LD>
<LD>   "I loved my time playing in L.A.," said Gretzky, 41, the executive
director of Canada's Olympic team and managing partner of the Phoenix
Coyotes. "When I first came to L.A., I remember some of my closest
friends telling me, 'What was I thinking?' and asking, 'Will hockey
ever go in L.A?' ... Fortunately, the whole organization has worked
hard in not only putting together as good a team as possible, but
more importantly, selling the game of hockey in the area of Southern
California."</LD>
<LD>   The date of the ceremony will be determined once the NHL releases
the Kings' 2002-03 schedule this summer.</LD>
<TE>   Gretzky, who played eight seasons with the Kings, including an
appearance in the Stanley Cup finals in 1993, had his No. 99
officially retired by all NHL teams after he completed his 20-year
career as the league's leading scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Although it may seem that the Kings took their time to retire
Gretzky's jersey, team President Tim Leiweke said that's far from the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Kings] wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him," Leiweke
said.. "We wanted to make sure that what we were doing was more than
just raising the jersey. We wanted to have a two-day celebration for
the greatest player, not just in our history but the history of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to give our fans an opportunity to be an
active participant in the tribute."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky's jersey retirement celebration will be preceded by a
charity dinner, a sports memorabilia auction and a possible fan
festival. Gretzky said another reason for the delay was that he
wanted to wait until  former King owner Bruce McNall was released
from  prison after serving  time for bank fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to wait until my friend Bruce was around," Gretzky said.
"I thought the timing would be better next year. It wasn't a problem
getting it worked out."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky became the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer as a King on
March 23, 1994, when he passed Gordie Howe with his 802nd goal.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky, who had 918 points in 538 games as a King, is fourth on
the Kings all-time scoring list.</TE>

<LD>Either by design or bad luck, Santa Ana Foothill, Bell Gardens and
Santa Margarita have avoided playing one another this season.</LD>
<LD>   The Southern California Invitational this weekend will provide the
teams a last opportunity to meet until the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   The tournament, in its seventh season, features 30 of the top
teams from the Southland, and Carlsbad and Coronado from the San
Diego Section. Every team in The Times' top 10 began play Thursday at
three sites: Heritage Park in Irvine, Lake Forest El Toro High and
Corona del Mar High. The final is Saturday at 3 p.m. at Heritage
Park.</LD>
<TE>   Foothill and Santa Margarita are seeded No. 1 in the two
eight-team brackets competing at Heritage Park, Bell Gardens is
top-seeded at El Toro and Santa Barbara is seeded No. 1 at Corona del
Mar. If each wins its quarterfinal game tonight, Foothill will play
Santa Margarita in one semifinal at 10 a.m. Saturday at Heritage
Park, followed by the other semifinal, pitting Bell Gardens and Santa
Barbara, the top-ranked team in Division II.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament will provide the toughest test of the season for
Bell Gardens (20-0), the three-time defending Division III champion,
which has not entered any of this winter's elite tournaments.
Foothill ended the Lancers' 85-game winning streak at the Southern
California Championships last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to gear everything toward Southern California
Championships," Bell Gardens Coach Robert Greenamyer said last week.
"The big thing right now is just working on the minor details."</TE>
<TE>   Foothill (17-1) and Santa Margarita (15-4) appeared headed toward
a showdown at the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions three weeks
ago, but the Eagles were upset in the semifinals by Santa Barbara.
The teams were also headed for a matchup in the Newport Harbor/Corona
del Mar tournament over Christmas break, but Santa Margarita lost
that semifinal to Poway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tough timetable: The Southern California Invitational has been in
existence longer than the Southern Section championships, which are
in their fifth year, and the team that survives the weekend without a
loss is unofficially considered the best in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty brutal," said Irvine Coach Scott Hinman, who has been
the tournament's director from the beginning. "Most coaches will
agree it's more difficult to win this tournament than [a section
title]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cool, cool water: Newport Harbor's game Wednesday against Irvine
Woodbridge had to be moved to Corona del Mar High because the water
was too cold at the Sailors' pool. A broken boiler was to blame, but
the late change of venue didn't keep Newport Harbor from a 13-2
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bill Barnett said the boiler has been inoperative since
December, dipping water temperatures to around 75 degrees. Most pools
are regulated to stay at 78 degrees or higher.</TE>
<TE>   The pool at Newport Harbor, one of the few 50-meter designs in
Southern California, has two boilers; the other is working. Barnett
said he hopes to have the boiler repaired in time for the Southern
Section playoffs later this month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Title contenders: The ugly spotlight on the Covina Charter Oak
water polo program last fall hasn't carried over to the swimming
pool. Charter Oak, whose coach was arrested in October for allegedly
having sex with a member of the team, clinched at least a tie for the
Miramonte League title Wednesday with a 12-2 victory over La Puente.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Oak is 8-0 in league and can clinch the title outright
with a victory Wednesday against visiting Hacienda Heights Los Altos
(7-2).</TE>

<HD>Canadian Import Fancy As Is Dressed Up, Ready to Go</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Gelding, a third-place finisher in San
Fernando, will try to stretch out in the Strub.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Always on the prowl for a good horse, trainer Bob Baffert tried to
buy Fancy As, a gelding that mopped up on most of the opposition in
western Canada last year. The deal didn't happen, but Baffert wound
up with the next-best thing: the chance to train the horse.</LD>
<LD>   So this is how Fancy As came to Santa Anita, and why he'll be that
rare Canadian-bred running in the Strub Stakes. The 55th edition of
the Strub, which is worth $500,000, will be run Saturday, when 11
horses--the biggest field since 1986--go to the gate.</LD>
<LD>   The 11/8-mile stake is the finale to a three-race series for foals
of 1998 that began with Mizzen Mast's victory in the Malibu on Dec.
26. The middle leg, the San Fernando on Jan. 12, was won by Western
Pride, who'll be back Saturday along with the four horses that ran
immediately behind him. Fancy As was one of those, finishing third
and losing by four lengths in his U.S. debut.</LD>
<TE>   The San Fernando was run at 11/16 miles. "The extra distance
[Saturday] should help him," said Gary Stevens, who rode Fancy As for
the first time in his last race. Red Smith, who owns Fancy As with
his wife Linda, said that the horse might be for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "Baffert offered us a fair price in early December," he said. "But
it was the end of the year and I was in a bad tax situation then.
That's why I didn't sell. But if he runs good in this one, who
knows?"</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths are already ahead on Fancy As. He has won 13 races,
with two seconds and one third, in 16 starts and earned $565,448. Red
Smith--named for  his original hair color, not after the late
Pulitzer Prize-winning sports columnist--bought the horse for 3,200
Canadian dollars ($2,148 U.S.) at a Manitoba yearling auction. The
horse was called Lucky Simba when he was led into the sales ring, but
the Smiths renamed him, combining part of the dam's name (Fancy
Lucky) and the last two letters of the sire's name (Dignitas).</TE>
<TE>   Red Smith, 63, was practically out the door of the sales pavilion
when he bid on Fancy As.</TE>
<TE>   "I got outbid on what turned out to be the sales topper, who went
for $27,000," Smith said. "I had bought a few other horses, and I
really bought this one just to fill up the trailer. He's a real
freak."</TE>
<TE>   The abbreviated past-performance lines of Fancy As would test the
geographical acumen of even the most inveterate of Daily Racing Form
readers. Last year, Fancy As, voted the second-best 3-year-old in
Canada, rolled to eight victories in nine starts at "StP" (Stampede
Park), "NP" (Northlands Park), "AsD" (Assiniboia Downs) and "Hst"
Hastings Park. His only 2001 loss was a second-place finish in the
Manitoba Derby in August.</TE>
<TE>   "We got suckered that day," said Smith, referring to an opening
half-mile of 49 seconds in the 11/8-mile race. Rallying off that
snail-like pace, Fancy As was three-quarters of a length short at the
wire.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Fernando, the pace was much more lively, but even
though Fancy As moved up from his early sixth-place position, he was
unable to threaten Western Pride through the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Western Pride, who could pass  the $1-million mark with a victory
in the Strub, drew the No. 5 post.  The lineup, with jockeys: Giant
Gentlemen, Alex Solis; Fancy As,  Stevens; Palmeiro, Laffit Pincay;
Mizzen Mast, Kent Desormeaux; Western Pride, Garrett Gomez; Momentum,
Corey Nakatani; Scorpion, Mike Smith; Pie N Burger, Victor Espinoza;
Discreet Hero, Pat Valenzuela; Orientate, Chris McCarron; and I Love
Silver, Eddie Delahoussaye. Western Pride and Scorpion will carry the
most weight,  123 pounds apiece,  two pounds more than Mizzen Mast.
Fancy As will carry 119.</TE>

<KH>INSIDER TRADING BOB MIESZERSKI</KH>
<HD>Another Test for Fun House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way Fun House broke her maiden on Dec. 8 at Hollywood Park, she
looked like a filly with a very bright future for owner--breeder
Verne Winchell and trainer Ron McAnally.</LD>
<LD>   A daughter of Prized out of the productive mare Bistra, she beat
maidens by three lengths and was 11-10 to remain unbeaten in her
first race at Santa Anita on New Year's Eve.</LD>
<LD>   Close early, Fun House backed up in the stretch and wound up sixth
in the field of eight, beaten by 81/2 lengths.</LD>
<TE>   It turns out the bay filly had an excuse. She bled in the race and
will be treated with Lasix for the first time when she makes her turf
debut in today's third race at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking from the rail in the field of 10 going 61/2 furlongs down
the hillside course, Fun House is the 5-2 second choice and the filly
she will have to beat is the 8-5 morning line choice.</TE>
<TE>   Carinae, a daughter of Nureyev, will make her first start in the
U.S. for trainer Bobby Frankel. Owned by Flaxman Holdings Ltd., she
had a win and a second in three races in England and, like Fun House,
she will be racing on Lasix for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   McAnally and Frankel also have strong contenders in the featured
seventh, the $75,000 Reloy at 11/4 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   The Seven Seas, a six-time winner on the grass, is the 5-2
favorite for Frankel while McAnally will send out 5-1 shot Nepenthe,
who has been 1-2-3 in seven of her nine starts on turf.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the field for the Reloy includes, from the inside out,
Dispersed Reward, Vencera, the 7-2 second choice, Flying With Mimi,
Desiraes My Candy, Tropical Lady and Slow Down.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth is a six-furlong race that brings
together some veteran claimers running for a $20,000 tag. The morning
line favorite is 7-2, a good indication how contentious the sprint
is.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Peter Walder. The trainer hasn't started many horses at
Gulfstream Park, but he had four wins and three seconds with his
first eight runners.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  The stewards at Gulfstream Park. The decision to give
jockey Eibar Coa a 30-day suspension for alleged "rough riding" in
Saturday's Ft. Lauderdale Handicap was, quite simply, a joke.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A trifecta in the sixth using Captain Bell
on top to Mr. Reed, Count Your Cards, Retro Fever and Death Trappe in
the two hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 4/79. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $26.80/$513.20. Total money bet: $460.</TE>

<HD>Richmond Is Hoping His Time Will Come</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>In a gym at Rhodes College, a few miles from the Pyramid, Mitch
Richmond strolled past Phil Jackson and a few reporters Thursday
afternoon and, in a mock whisper, said, "Ask him if I'm going to
play. Go on. Ask."</LD>
<LD>   Jackson laughed.</LD>
<LD>   "Why?" Jackson said, which made Richmond laugh too.</LD>
<TE>   Richmond, the 36-year-old shooter, was supposed to be more
involved by now. Instead, his minutes have come mostly in blowouts,
or in what Jackson considers the "soft" parts of games.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson makes no apologies. He claims many matchups do not suit
Richmond, but that there is time for Richmond to become more
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond insists he is happy with his decision to come to the
Lakers. "I'm not saying it's not difficult sometimes," he said, "but
I'm reaching a goal."</TE>
<TE>   His aim was to win, and perhaps win big, all the way into June,
the sort of thing he'd never done before. In the meantime, he has
been upbeat for his teammates and, in particular, Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I have confidence in him," Richmond said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Thursday that he is leaning toward having Shaquille
O'Neal go to the All-Star game, with the hope that Western Conference
Coach Don Nelson honors O'Neal's request to play only a few minutes.</TE>

<LD>In what could shape up as a preview of the Indianapolis 500 as well
as the March 24 Indy Racing League 400 at California Speedway, a
number of CART drivers will participate in the IRL's "Test in the
West" next week in Fontana.</LD>
<LD>   Former Indianapolis 500 winner Kenny Brack, who was unable to
defend the title he won in 1999 because he'd switched to Bobby
Rahal's CART team in 2000, will be back and looking forward to
another crack at the world's biggest race. Brack has moved again,
this time to Chip Ganassi's team, to assure himself an Indy ride.
Teammate Bruno Junqueira of Brazil will also be at Fontana.</LD>
<LD>   Ganassi, the first major CART owner to test the 500 after the
CART-IRL split in 1996, won the race in 2000 with Juan Montoya.</LD>
<TE>   Rahal, who had opposed running at Indianapolis while the two
open-wheel series remained apart, changed his mind when one of his
major sponsors, Miller, withdrew from the CART series and said it
will run only the Indy 500, with Team Rahal driver Jimmy Vasser.
Vasser, who won the Marlboro 500 at California Speedway in 1999, also
will be at Fontana for the test.</TE>
<TE>   Brack and Junqueira will be in Chevrolet-powered G Forces, Vasser
in a Dallara-Chevy. Although no announcement has been made, all are
expected to compete in the March 24 race.</TE>
<TE>   CART champion Gil de Ferran and defending Indy 500 winner Helio
Castroneves, from Roger Penske's team, will make their first formal
appearances as IRL drivers. Penske broke from CART last year to enter
both in the 500 and this year made the move complete by announcing
his team would run the full IRL schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Castroneves, IRL champion Sam Hornish Jr. and former champions
Scott Sharp and Buddy Lazier will miss Tuesday's media day to
practice in IROC cars at Daytona International Speedway. The first
IROC race will be Feb. 15 at Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   All four will fly back for Wednesday's practice, which will be
open to the public from 1 to 4 p.m. and free of charge.</TE>
<TE>   In other IRL news, A.J. Foyt named Donnie Beechler to drive his
second car as a teammate to Chilean veteran Eliseo Salazar, the
highest finishing IRL driver in last year's Indy race. Beechler drove
six races for Foyt last year on a race-to-race basis and had a best
finish of third at Kansas Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Beechler nor Salazar will be at California Speedway. They
will begin practice Feb. 5-6 at Phoenix International Raceway in
another IRL test.</TE>
<TE>   Drag Racing</TE>
<TE>   Cory McClenathan, one of the finest top-fuel drivers in the
National Hot Rod Assn., but without a ride for the last year, will
return to the strip next week when the 42nd Winternationals open the
season at Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   McClenathan, winner of 26 national events, will drive Rick
Henkelman's dragster, the same one he drove to two wins at the close
of 2000. The car was purchased at that time by Brad Anderson, who is
turning it over to Henkelman.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Berres, of the Reading (Pa.) Eagle-Times, polled drag racing
writers around the country and found that Larry Dixon, Don
Prudhomme's top-fuel driver, was favored to unseat champion Kenny
Bernstein. There were no surprises in funny car and pro stock, where
John Force and Warren Johnson were selected to repeat. In pro stock
motorcycle, champion Angelle Savoie was only a third choice behind
Matt Hines and Antron Brown. Dark horse selections were Andrew Cowin,
top fuel; Gary Scelzi, funny car; Kurt Johnson, pro stock; and Steve
Johnson, pro motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   Rolex 24 Hours</TE>
<TE>   One of the most diverse fields in 40 years of the 24 Hours of
Daytona will line up Saturday for the twice-around-the-clock
spectacle. Drivers from NASCAR, CART, Trans Am and the IRL have
joined sports car regulars from the Grand American Road Racing Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart, last year's Winston Cup runner-up, will share a ride
with road racing veterans Jan Lammers and Johnny Mowlen in a V-10
Judd-powered Crawford. It will be Stewart's debut in a sports car
race, but he proved his road racing ability last year when he won the
Winston Cup race at Sears Point.</TE>
<TE>   Lammers won in 1990 with European drivers Andy Wallace and Johnny
Dumfries. Wallace will be back in an unusual Porsche-powered Lola,
driving with five-time winner Hurley Haywood and Porsche factory
drivers Lucas Luhr and Sascha Maassen.</TE>
<TE>   Other NASCAR entries, getting a head start before Daytona 500
practice opens next week, include Robby Gordon, Kevin Harvick, Kyle
Petty and John Andretti. One of Gordon's teammates will be Sharp in
an Orbit Racing Porsche.</TE>
<TE>   Max Papis will represent CART in a Judd-powered Dallara with
sports car regulars Didier Theys and Mauro Baldi.</TE>
<TE>   Theys won in 1997, and Baldi is one of only five active drivers to
have won Daytona, LeMans and Sebring.</TE>
<TE>   Three Trans Am champions, Paul Gentilozzi, Brian Simo and Scott
Pruett, will share Gentilozzi's Rocketsports Jaguar. Bill Auberlen,
another former Daytona winner, will be in a Ferrari with former
Daytona 500 winner Derrike Cope.</TE>
<TE>   Stock Cars</TE>
<TE>   The eight-race Winston West stock car season will open Saturday at
Phoenix International Raceway with team owner Bill McNally looking
for his fourth consecutive championship, but with a new driver,
Austin Cameron. Brendan Gaughan, winner the last two years, has moved
up to the Craftsman truck series. Sean Woodside, the 1999 champion,
will return to the series.</TE>
<TE>   Hershel McGriff, 74, has announced that he will compete one more
year with his own team, leaving McNally's Orleans Racing team. Crew
chief duties will be shared by Hershel McGriff Jr. and Steve
Portenga. Other favorites include Johnny Borneman, Scott Gaylord and
Kevin Richards.</TE>
<TE>   Fast Laps</TE>
<TE>   Scott Goodyear, two-time Indianapolis 500 runner-up, has retired
as a driver and will become a broadcaster with ABC at IRL events....
Perris Auto Speedway will hold its first practice session Tuesday
night. The season will open Feb. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Smith of Riverside had to drive both legs of the feature
Trophy-Truck race in last week's SCORE Laughlin Desert Challenge when
his partner, Dave Ashley, was sidelined by a stomach ailment, but he
brought his Enduro Racing Ford F-150 home in first place. Brothers
Dale and Mike Dondel of Hemet upset Troy Herbst of Las Vegas for the
overall victory in an unlimited Class 1 Nye Frank-built open-wheel
desert car.</TE>

<HD>Cavaliers Lose at Hands of Jordan Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only Michael Jordan, and only in Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan did it to the Cavaliers and their fans again, hitting an
18-foot jumper at the buzzer Thursday night to give the Washington
Wizards a 93-92 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan victimized Cleveland throughout his career with the Chicago
Bulls, and although he now wears a Washington jersey, No. 23 still
has the Cavaliers' number.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody in the place knew where the ball was going," Jordan
said. "I've had some big shots in Cleveland, and they keep going in."</TE>
<TE>   With 1.6 seconds left and Washington down 92-91, Jordan got free
on a defensive switch and calmly made his jumper for the Wizards, who
had trailed by 12 points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's game-winner was almost identical to the shot he made in
Game 5 over Craig Ehlo at Richfield Coliseum in 1989 to defeat the
Cavaliers and eliminate Cleveland from the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 125, Milwaukee 100--Jason Kidd recorded his league-best
fourth triple-double with 21 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds as
the Nets won at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The point total was the Nets' highest this season and it helped
them snap a five-game losing streak against the Bucks that dated to
March 18, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 95, Houston 91--All-Star guard Steve Nash scored 33 points,
15 in the last eight minutes at Dallas as the Mavericks needed an
unexpected comeback to win.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks blew a 17-point lead and trailed 73-69 before Nash
began his game-ending run with five consecutive points.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 97, Boston 92--Vince Carter scored 27 points as the
Raptors rallied from a 17-point deficit at Toronto and extended their
winning streak to three games.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was No. 74 for Coach Lenny Wilkens, who became the
winningest coach in the franchise's seven-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 105, Phoenix 97--Rasheed Wallace and Bonzi Wells each
scored 20 points at Portland, Ore., as the Trail Blazers won for 11th
time in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers, who shot 68.2% in the first period, set a
season high for points in a quarter with 39.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 99, Seattle 95--Peja Stojakovic made a three-pointer
and an 18-footer in the final minute as the Kings, playing without
the suspended Chris Webber, won at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belo Corp. has sold its minority stake in the Mavericks and their
new downtown arena to team controlling owner Mark Cuban. Belo will
receive $27 million for its 12.38% share of the team and its 6.19%
stake in the American Airlines Center.... The Raptors put center
Hakeem Olajuwon on the injured list because of a right quadriceps
strain and he is expected to be out four to six weeks.</TE>

<LD>The NCAA denied Tennessee receiver Donte Stallworth's request to have
his eligibility reinstated after he changed his mind about entering
the NFL draft.</LD>
<LD>   NCAA officials called the university Thursday and said the

<HD>Occidental Player Dies in Crash</HD>
<DH>College baseball: Team opens season today, three days after
wreck that killed shortstop Davis and injured four others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN LOUMENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Occidental College will open its baseball season at noon today, three
days after a car accident killed the team's starting shortstop and
injured four other students, including an outfielder and two football
players.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Davis, an 18-year-old freshman from Colorado Springs, Colo.,
died Tuesday after the 1990 Mazda 929 in which the students were
traveling drifted off southbound Interstate 15 and flipped. The
California Highway Patrol is investigating the single-car accident,
which happened three miles south of the Nevada border at
approximately 6:45 a.m. as the students returned from Las Vegas. No
alcohol or drugs were involved, according to a preliminary report by
the CHP.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, one of two passengers not in a safety-restraint system,
sustained massive head injuries when he was thrown from the vehicle,
the CHP said. He died as he was being airlifted to the hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Andy Crocker, the 19-year-old freshman who was driving, was taken
to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, along with passengers
Emerson Nagle, 20, Jim Hart, 18, and Ted Helgert, 18.</TE>
<TE>   Hart, a football player from Federal Way, Wash., and Nagle, a
former baseball player from Carlsbad, remain in serious condition, a
University Medical Center spokesman said. Nagle was the other
passenger not wearing a seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   Crocker, an outfielder from Porterville, and Helgert, an
All-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference offensive
lineman from Moreno Valley Canyon Springs, were treated for minor
injuries and released. Crocker will not play this weekend and his
return to the team is uncertain, school officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The baseball team, which has embroidered Davis' initials into
their caps, voted to open the season as scheduled with a doubleheader
today at home against Simpson College of Redding. The first game
starts at noon. On Saturday, the team travels to Chapman College for
a 1 p.m. game. There will be a moment of silence before the first
game of the doubleheader.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know whether to play or not," Coach Jeff Henderson
said. "The team has had a hard time over the last couple of days, but
we got together as a team and decided to play to honor [Greg]."</TE>
<TE>   Henderson said Davis was admired by his teammates and respected
for his love of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an incredible young man," Henderson said. "He loved
baseball so much. The guys saw that and respected that. Because of
that, I don't think he will ever leave us."</TE>
<TE>   Helgert, a 6-foot-5, 280-pound lineman, was the only freshman
selected to the All-SCIAC football team. He played primarily at
tackle for the Tigers, who went 8-1 and won the conference title.
Hart sat out last season because of an injury.</TE>

<KH>OUTDOORS PETE THOMAS</KH>
<HD>Midway Atoll Is Off-Limits Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, site of the infamous World War
II battle but more recently a gem of a destination for fishermen,
divers and eco-tourists, is no longer accessible to the public.</LD>
<LD>   Midway Phoenix Corp., which has managed the airport and tourism
services since the remote atoll went public in 1996, said this week
that it has decided to end what it calls an "unacceptable"
relationship with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and cancel its
contract with Aloha Airlines. There are no more inbound passenger
flights. The last outbound flight, carrying the remainder of Midway
Phoenix employees, is scheduled March 2.</LD>
<LD>   However, Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield said the
agency has "yet to receive anything in writing that formally
terminates our cooperative agreement."</LD>
<TE>   The unique public-private agreement had been seen as the only
viable means of maintaining the infrastructure while at the same time
enabling an official government presence on the atoll, a two-island
speck in the Hawaiian Island chain located 1,300 miles northwest of
Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   The concept was simple. Tourism would fund management of the
airport, employee and guest housing, the running of power plants and
purchasing of fuel. Refuge personnel would be in charge of flora and
fauna.</TE>
<TE>   But the partnership was precarious from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say we were the Hatfields and McCoys, but we were
operating under two different philosophies and living in two
different worlds," said Bob Tracey, executive vice president of
Midway Phoenix, a subsidiary of Phoenix Air Group in Cartersville,
Ga. "They were not visitor-friendly and were increasingly telling our
guests what they couldn't do rather than what they could do. We've
had it with their dictatorial attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Guests are told upon arrival to distance themselves from wildlife
whenever possible. About 2 million seabirds--15 species in all--nest
on the shores of Sand and Eastern islands, which are home to the
world's largest breeding population of Laysan albatross. The Hawaiian
monk seal is among the endangered animals afforded an especially wide
berth from humans.</TE>
<TE>   Tracey said the government agency's insistence on killing ironwood
trees, which are not indigenous but provide the only relief from the
sun, is further evidence that biologists favor returning Midway to
its natural state over the accommodation of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Refuge manager Rob Shallenberger, who said restrictions on
tourists are no greater than they have been from the beginning, has
denied killing trees on Sand Island, the only populated island.
Midway Phoenix employees have charged otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism also has been affected deeply by the state of the economy
and by concerns over the safety of travel. But restrictions on
tourists, he added, were making it increasingly difficult for Midway
Phoenix to meet its $399,420 monthly operational costs.</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell countered by saying that the original agreement called for
no government expenditure at Midway, but that Fish and Wildlife
expenditures to date have totaled about $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   If this is the end of the partnership, and if another private
company does not step in and take Midway Phoenix's place, it will
have a ripple effect. The U.S. Coast Guard would lose a mid-ocean
refueling stop and overseas commercial air carriers would lose an
emergency Pacific Ocean landing base, which is required for certain
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists, and students involved in research programs at Midway,
would lose access to a place aflutter with avian wonders--including
the rare golden gooney--and to a lagoon that is frequented by
everything from colorful little reef fish to enormous tiger sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell said that regardless of what happens, the Fish and
Wildlife Service intends to maintain a presence on the atoll. "Of
course it'd be a small group," she said. "And we'd have to find other
ways to get back and forth."</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear what would become of the structures and other
mementos left by the U.S. Navy before its pullout was completed in
1997. Or of the memorial on Sand Island honoring those who lost their
lives during the Battle of Midway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Southern California skiers and snowboarders will find the best
conditions of the season on the local slopes. This week's storm, by
far the coldest and most significant of the season, dumped up to 11/2
feet of light powder in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains,
boosting base depths to nearly three feet.</TE>

<HD>Jacobsen Scores 49 for Stanford</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Casey Jacobsen turned in one of the finest performances ever by a
Stanford player, scoring 49 points as the 18th-ranked Cardinal
defeated Arizona State, 90-81, on Thursday night at Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   Julius Barnes had 18 points for Stanford (13-5, 6-3), one of two
Pacific 10 Conference teams unbeaten at home this season, and Curtis
Borchardt had 10 points and 11 rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobsen scored 31 points in the second half, and was 14 of 22
overall from the field. Only Hank Luisetti--with 50 points against
Duquesne in 1937--has scored more in a Stanford uniform.</LD>
<TE>   Jacobsen's effort was the most ever by a player at Maples
Pavilion, and the first time a Cardinal reached 40 points in a game
since Ron Tomsic did it during the 1954-55 season. The former Maples
mark was held by Arizona's Damon Stoudamire with 45.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen, who made six of 10 three-points shots, entered the game
with a 21.3 scoring average against the Sun Devils, his best against
any opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Prewitt scored 18 points to lead Arizona State (11-8, 4-6),
which lost its third in four games. The Sun Devils lost their eighth
consecutive to Stanford and for the 12th time in 13 games.Borchardt
completed a three-point play with 9:36 remaining to tie the game at
62-62 and Jacobsen made an NBA-range three-pointer less than 30
seconds later to put the Cardinal in front for good.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Arizona 68, California 58--Jason Gardner scored all but two
of his 17 points in the second half and the Wildcats stopped the
Bears' 12-game home winning streak at Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona Coach Lute Olson's 600th game, the Wildcats (14-6, 7-3)
went on a 12-0 run midway through the second half to break a 49-49
tie.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Anderson had 16 points and 13 rebounds and Luke Walton had 13
points, 11 rebounds and six assists for Arizona, which had lost two
consecutive.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Shipp had 12 points, Ryan Forehan-Kelly 11 and Brian Wethers

<HD>This 'Rock' Beats a Pebble</HD>
<DH>Golf: Schwarzrock ties course record with 28 on front and
leads by two shots after eight-under 64.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEBBLE BEACH</DL>
<LD>After a 45-minute delay because of frost, the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am got going, which could only mean that Brent
Schwarzrock started rolling.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, that Brent Schwarzrock, a three-time survivor of qualifying
school, a guy who sounds more like Barney Rubble's next-door neighbor
than the first-round leader at Pebble Beach, but that's just who he
is. Schwarzrock, a 29-year-old from Orlando, Fla., shot an
eight-under-par 64 Thursday at nippy Pebble, including a
course-record-tying 28 on the front side, and leads Matt Gogel and
Pat Perez by two shots.</LD>
<LD>   After he added up his 28 that featured an eagle, six birdies and
two pars, Schwarzrock couldn't say much.</LD>
<TE>   "It was just an awesome day," he said. "What more could you ask
for? It was a great day."</TE>
<TE>   For many, including Tiger Woods, it was merely a long day. Woods
toured Poppy Hills in a two-under 70 that took six hours and five
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Woods didn't have a birdie after his seventh hole, but at least he
wasn't sick, which is an improvement over Wednesday, when he wasn't
able to break his fever until the second hole of his practice round.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't 100%, but I was good enough to play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was, everybody played so slowly. If you combine the
frost delay with a field of 180 pros and 180 amateurs playing
semi-difficult courses with fast greens and plenty of trouble, it
means rounds in excess of six hours.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says something needs to be done about it. "It's the time of
the year," he said. "You've just got to hang in there and battle
through it. I think they should cut the field so we could get around
in a reasonable time."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, in spite of the pace of play, it turned out to be a
reasonably good day for scoring at host course Pebble, as well as
Poppy Hills and at Spyglass Hill. That's if you don't count defending
champion Davis Love III, who had a 76 at Spyglass.</TE>
<TE>   Gogel made four consecutive birdies at the start and credited his
putting and his mentality.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he had a seven-shot lead over Woods with seven
holes to go at Pebble Beach and wound up losing by two shots. Nobody
asked him about it Thursday, but it's there, waiting in the shadows
to jump out and surprise him Sunday if he's still around.</TE>
<TE>   Perez shot a 66 at Spyglass. Perez, 25, who graduated from
qualifying school in the same class as Schwarzrock, is playing his
fourth PGA Tour event and missed the cut at the Bob Hope and the
Phoenix Open. He tied for 17th at the Sony Open in his debut.</TE>
<TE>   John Rollins, still another qualifying school grad, shot a
five-under 67 at Spyglass and is three shots off the lead, tied with
Jesper Parnevik and Phil Tataurangi. Lee Janzen, Pete Jordan, Matt
Kuchar and Paul Claxton are next at 68.</TE>
<TE>   As for Woods, he's feeling much better about himself, and part of
that is due to the new driver he used for the first time Thursday.
It's a prototype of a new Nike driver, a forged titanium model with a
thin face for greater club-head speed that is designed to create more
power.</TE>
<TE>   "New technology, everybody's hitting it longer, I've got to keep
up with the young pups. I'm just trying it out," said Woods, who had
nothing bad to say about his new club.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't my driver's fault today," he said. "I hit it well, I
just wasn't able to take advantage of the places I hit it."</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of sun, but there was also plenty of wet ground
at all three courses. Once players found shade, it was on the far
side of cold, and a consistent breeze made it seem even cooler. Woods
wore a turtleneck and a sweater and he still failed to look even
reasonably comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to know that's the way it's going to be and you
deal with it," he said. "That's the way the golf is around here."</TE>
<TE>   It only seems as if it's all in slow motion.</TE>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The father stands in the back of the hotel ballroom, brittle in the
embrace of a world that doesn't understand.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not the sort of family that goes around laughing," he says.
"I don't know if anybody ever saw my teeth unless I took them out."</LD>
<LD>   The son stands in the front of the same ballroom, pinning that
embrace behind our backs.</LD>
<TE>   "For better or worse, this is who I am," he says, later adding,
"however that is interpreted, I'll leave it up to you to interpret."</TE>
<TE>   He smirks.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you already have."</TE>
<TE>   We have. Or, we had. At this point, we have no idea what to think.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Belichick was a jerk. The biggest jerk in headsets. The
easiest conclusion in football.</TE>
<TE>   He insulted the city of Cleveland and its beloved quarterback
Bernie Kosar before being thrown aside.</TE>
<TE>   He insulted the city of New York before walking away.</TE>
<TE>   He insulted classy quarterback Drew Bledsoe in New England this
season before ... one of pro football's classiest quarterbacks this
season before ... this is where it gets confusing.</TE>
<TE>   Before he stepped into the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Before he showed up here this week with the scrawny Patriots to
challenge the mighty St. Louis Rams for a Super Bowl title.</TE>
<TE>   Before some of his players claimed they are winning because he has
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Says defensive end Anthony Pleasant, a former Belichick target:
"He's no longer some of the things we used to call him back in
Cleveland. You know, like, 'Butthead.'"</TE>
<TE>   Says punter Ken Walter, a former Belichick ballboy: "There was a
time when you couldn't even look him in the eye, you had to just stay
out of his way. Now, you can actually talk to him."</TE>
<TE>   So, wait a minute.</TE>
<TE>   The man the Browns once also called "Little Hitler" is now a
Little Prince?</TE>
<TE>   Like we said, wait a minute.</TE>
<TE>   His highest paid player is so angry with him, his jaw clenches
when he utters his name.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard for Bledsoe to forget that while he lay nearly dying
after suffering internal injuries earlier this season, his coach was
telling the media he would be back in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a player-coach relationship, nothing more," Bledsoe says.</TE>
<TE>   That punter with all those nice words? He is here only because,
five games into the season, starter Lee Johnson was cut after
dropping a snap.</TE>
<TE>   Just listen to safety and team leader Lawyer Milloy.</TE>
<TE>   "The man doesn't want to be your friend," he says. "If you win,
he'll smile at you. If you lose, he won't even look at you."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's veteran Bryan Cox, who tells a story about playing
for Belichick when he was assistant head coach of the New York Jets
two seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   Cox said that, other than barking coaching orders, Belichick never
spoke casually to him until thanking him while walking off the field
after the final game.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much to him," says Cox.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but on that point, everyone is unanimous in their
disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   This week showed that there is plenty to Bill Belichick.</TE>
<TE>   It also showed that we'll probably never have a clue how much.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there being a slim chance this dour soul could be the
brightest star in the sports world come Sunday night, we must hunker
down and investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys didn't like last him last year, did you?" barks his
father Steve, an 83-year-old former coach. "You didn't think he was
too smart, did you?"</TE>
<TE>   The football coach and the schoolteacher wanted their only child
to learn about decisions.</TE>
<TE>   So when little Bill Belichick was 4 and accompanying his parents
to a restaurant, he was instructed to order by himself off the menu.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine that, a little kid making his own choices," recalls
Steve.</TE>
<TE>   Until those choices became wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Little Bill, you see, liked fried chicken. So everywhere they
would go, he would order fried chicken. Until he was ordered to
conform.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Dammit, you don't understand, you just don't do
that,'" says Steve. "You order steak at steak places. Fish at fish
places. That sort of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Part of you feels sorry for Belichick.</TE>
<TE>   His father, an admitted "tough-ass," remembers attending only one
of his son's football games in the kid's entire childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always traveling, scouting, working for my teams," says
Steve, who was an assistant coach for four decades at several
colleges, most notably the Naval Academy. "What was I going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   His father also never remembers his son, not once in his 49 years,
telling a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "He's never said, 'Hey Dad, I've got a good one for you.... '"
Steve recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Part of you, however, is envious of Belichick.</TE>
<TE>   At age 5, he would sit with his father and a fellow Navy coach on
the front porch of the family's Annapolis, Md., home, listening to
them devise a game plan.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, an envelope would be delivered to Bill with our
game plan in it, and he would study it on his own," Steve says.</TE>
<TE>   "Even as a little kid, he knew all of our terms and understood our
plays."</TE>
<TE>   It was from this environment of wildly ranging temperatures that a
most interesting football coach was incubated.</TE>
<TE>   Turning down a chance to become a young executive at Procter &amp;
Gamble, Belichick graduated with a Wesleyan economics degree directly
to the Baltimore Colts, where his father's connections helped him
land a job breaking down film.</TE>
<TE>   Today, reputedly, nobody does it better. Nobody is considered
smarter at understanding an opponent's weaknesses, or more adept at
exploiting them.</TE>
<TE>   At 38, Belichick devised a game plan that helped the New York
Giants freeze the high-scoring Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV.</TE>
<TE>   It was considered such football genius, the game plan hangs today
in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   The next season, the Cleveland Browns made him a head coach.</TE>
<TE>   An impersonal, brooding, nasty head coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He was terrible," says Pleasant, who played for Belichick with
the Browns. "Nobody liked him."</TE>
<TE>   Belichick was a pupil of Bill Parcells who tried to win with the
swagger of Parcells.</TE>
<TE>   But he couldn't pull it off. He didn't look the part. He didn't
know when to back off.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like, here's how they won in New York, so here's how they
were going to do it here, no questions asked," Pleasant says.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the rest of the league, the Browns practiced every day in
pads, until finally the players had enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a meeting and decided to boycott a practice," he recalls,
smiling. "It didn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Pleasant says by then, Belichick wouldn't even talk to most of the
team. After his first two years, folks wondered how it could get any
worse.</TE>
<TE>   Well, in the middle of the 1993 season, it did.</TE>
<TE>   That was when Belichick stunningly cut town favorite Bernie Kosar,
even though the quarterback had led the team to a 5-3 record and the
Central Division lead.</TE>
<TE>   His reason? Kosar didn't agree with a Belichick scheme on offense
that clearly was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Kosar's immediate replacement? Because backup Vinny Testaverde was
injured, it was somebody named Todd Philcox, who committed four
turnovers in the first half of his first game. The Browns went 2-6
the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Many folks forget that Belichick used Testaverde to lead them to
the playoffs the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Most only remember his next act, five years after being fired by
the Browns, when a contract stipulation elevated him to coach of the
Jets after Parcells quit.</TE>
<TE>   He lasted one day, resigning at a news conference scheduled to
coronate him, leaving the Jets because he was worried about their
financial future.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he was contractually bound to stay, and had received a
$1-million bonus the previous season as a good-faith gesture.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't even have the decency to give the Jets a complete
resignation letter, writing only that he was " ... resigning as HC of
the NYJ."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots eventually agreed to give the Jets a first-round pick
for him but, by now, his reputation was complete.</TE>
<TE>   Great mind. Rotten guy.</TE>
<TE>   But then something happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing happened," says Steve. "I don't believe people change
personalities. The problem was that everybody in Boston believed what
they heard from everybody in Cleveland before even knowing Bill."</TE>
<TE>   No, something happened. Even though you could never tell from
looking at that eternal frown, he lightened up.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders say he finally realized he was not Parcells.</TE>
<TE>   With Parcells finally retired for good, he would never have to be
Parcells.</TE>
<TE>   He could finally order fried chicken whenever he wanted, wherever
he wanted. He could finally be just Bill Belichick.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that he's suddenly this great, outgoing guy," says one
longtime observer. "But where he was once subhuman, now he's just a
regular human."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he would ever admit it, of course.</TE>
<TE>   In one moment, he says, "I think that I've learned a lot in the
last 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   But in the next moment, he says, "I still am pretty much who I am.
My intention is not to try to have conflict, or be iron-fisted, or
tyrannical, but to get across a message."</TE>
<TE>   That message, mixed as it may be, was clear earlier this year
when, long after a Sunday afternoon game, stunned writers spotted the
Patriot coach running across the Foxboro Stadium field.</TE>
<TE>   He was playing touch football with his three children.</TE>
<TE>   As only Bill Belichick can play it.</TE>
<TE>   "I can cook up some stuff out there," he said the next day. "They
just don't know what to do."</TE>

<LD>La Puente Bishop Amat High didn't want Noelle Quinn or Nykia Peace of
Torrance Bishop Montgomery to beat them, and they didn't.</LD>
<LD>   Melinda Loera did.</LD>
<LD>   The senior forward scored eight of her 10 points in the fourth
quarter as No. 6-ranked Bishop Montgomery rallied and defeated the
host Lancers, 52-47, on Thursday night to clinch a share of its third
consecutive Del Rey League girls' basketball title.</LD>
<TE>   "The shots just started falling and everything clicked," said
Loera, who made only one of her first eight shots before making three
long jump shots and a running hook shot in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, rated as one of the nation's top junior players, had 20
points, five rebounds and five steals. Peace added 11 points for the
Knights (19-4, 7-0 in league), who have won 22 consecutive league
games. The two-time defending state Division III champions can clinch
the league title outright with a victory next week against
second-place Playa del Rey St. Bernard.</TE>
<TE>   Few third-place teams can match Bishop Amat (19-7, 3-3), which led
by as many as nine points. But few leagues are as tough as the Del
Rey, which has four teams on pace to win 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore forward Erin Myrick scored 13 points and junior guard
Charleen Teodoro had 10 points for Bishop Amat, ranked second in
Southern Section Division III-AA.</TE>
<TE>   Loera, averaging five points a game, made a 16-foot shot midway
through the fourth quarter to put Bishop Montgomery ahead, 41-39.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Desmond</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ventura 69, Santa Barbara San Marcos 35--Jenni Dooley scored 17
points and set a Ventura County record for career three-point baskets
in the host Cougars' Channel League victory.</TE>
<TE>   Dooley made five three-point shots to raise her total to 205 to
break the record of 203 set by Michelle Palmisano of Thousand Oaks
from 1989-1992. Dooley's total ranks seventh on the all-time Southern
Section list.</TE>
<TE>   The victory clinched a share of the league title for No. 10
Ventura (21-2, 6-0).</TE>
<TE>   In boys' basketball:</TE>
<TE>   Loyola 70, West Hills Chaminade 57--Josh Flynn-Brown scored 21
points and Omar Wilkes had 16 for No. 18 Loyola (19-3, 8-1) in a
Mission League victory at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs outscored Chaminade, 26-14, in the second quarter to take
a 39-24 halftime lead. Chaminade is 18-6, 6-3.</TE>

<HD>Man About Town</HD>
<DH>Aeneas Williams, Proud to Be From New Orleans, Finds a Home
on Rams' Corner</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Aeneas Williams, St. Louis Ram defensive back, is proud to be from
New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   He's proud to have played football at Alcee Fortier High,
pronounced "For-shay."</LD>
<LD>   Williams is happy to speak "New Awlins." Williams is happy to
sound different and is happy when he runs into anyone anywhere who
has that accent. Williams is happy to be from a place where, as he
says, "Football was in the fabric of the city."</LD>
<TE>   Williams is happy he started playing tackle football when he was
4. He is happy the other 4-year-olds didn't want to see Williams and
his helmet and his fortitude coming full steam ahead. He is even
happy to say that his first separated shoulder came when he was 8.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is not embarrassed that his 40-yard-dash time in high
school was a lineman-like 4.99 or that he was "slow and skinny,"
according to Fortier football Coach Robert Welch, the offensive
coordinator when Williams played.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Williams embarrassed that he didn't play college football
until his junior year at Southern. "In our family," Williams says,
"you went to college to learn and not to play football."</TE>
<TE>   Williams was not conflicted about turning down an academic
scholarship to Dartmouth. His father, Lawrence Williams, got his
degree from Southern, and so did Aeneas.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is proud to be 34 and the husband of Tracy, who has a
master's in business administration and agricultural economics from
Illinois and even prouder to be the father of Saenea (Aeneas spelled
backward), Tirzah and Lazarus.</TE>
<TE>   And Williams is proud his father named him Aeneas and his brother
Achilles. Lawrence Williams got tired of being the third or fourth
Lawrence Williams in every class--grade school, high school and
college--and so named his sons after the characters he admired in his
Greek mythology class at Southern.</TE>
<TE>   If there were days, as Aeneas Williams says, he wished he were
named Ralph because everybody could pronounce Ralph, he is now proud
of the name.</TE>
<TE>   And proud that he is a seven-time NFL Pro Bowl honoree because of
his own hard work and not only his God-given talent. How did Williams
go from running a 4.99 40-yard dash to a 4.4, sometimes even a 4.3
now? "Hard work, hard work and extremely hard work," says Welch, who</TE>
<TE>   calls Williams the best example of a self-made player.</TE>
<TE>   Williams respects hard work and its benefits.</TE>
<TE>   He respects his parents for making him earn his way all his life.
He sold peanuts and popcorn at the Superdome during Saint games. Then
he would sneak down to the Saints' locker room in hopes of grabbing
some chin straps and sweaty wristbands. He delivered flowers for the
family florist shop, Williams Florists.</TE>
<TE>   Flower delivery wasn't so bad until the day he was asked to pin
the Williams Florist corsage onto the dress on a corpse at the local
funeral home. "I ran home and told my mom I didn't want to do that
any more, and my mom told me it wasn't the dead ones you had to be
afraid of, it was the live ones who would give you trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is confounded by some of the questions this week. Why did
he willingly spend 10 years with the dreadful Arizona Cardinals? Why
did he not complain? Why did he not demand a trade, hold out, pick up
and move to a place where he could better showcase his skills, where
his work ethic would be emulated not only by other players but also
by ownership, where he could, let's face it, become a big star on a
playoff stage?</TE>
<TE>   "I made a commitment. I was being paid by the Cardinals to do my
job and it was up to me to do that job as best I could," Williams
says.</TE>
<TE>   So Williams is content that he fulfilled his contract, accepted
gracefully the designation as franchise player and then moved happily
along when the Cardinals sent Williams to St. Louis for second- and
fourth-round draft picks last year.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is comfortable with himself. He is comfortable being an
ordained minister. He thanks God for his blessings, but he will not
make others uncomfortable with his faith. He'll talk about God if you
want to listen. He'll talk about Dick "Night Train" Lane if you want
to talk about that.</TE>
<TE>   Williams knows about Lane, who held the single-season record for
interceptions when he died Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the guys who transformed the cornerback position,"
Williams said. "He'll always be remembered as one of the greatest
cornerbacks who played the game."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is not happy so many of his colleagues don't know about
"Night Train" and other NFL history. Williams doesn't blame the young
guys. "I am concerned there's not a concerted effort to keep veterans
around longer to bridge the gap," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   All those years when he went off to the Pro Bowl, fresh after a
month off because, after all, the Cardinals weren't in the playoffs,
he'd wait for the other Pro Bowl players, the ones who were bruised
and tired from the playoffs and the Super Bowl to arrive in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'd do is ask those guys questions," Williams says. "I wanted
to know how they did it, how their teams did it. What did it take to
get to the Super Bowl? I'd take notes. I always took notes."</TE>
<TE>   The notes didn't tell Williams to intercept two Brett Favre passes
in the NFC semifinals and score on them. The notes didn't tell
Williams how to pick off the last pass of the NFC championship game,
the one from young and talented Donovan McNabb, the one that sealed
the Rams' 29-24 victory and sent Williams home to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is a man who has never missed a game in 11 years. Bad
teams, good teams, Williams played.</TE>
<TE>   He is a man who has 50 interceptions, 11 returned for touchdowns.
He is a man who earns the praise of his teammates--"Aeneas Williams
has made me a better player and a better man," says cornerback Dre'
Bly--and of his coaches--"Aeneas is the epitome of what a
professional football player should be and what a good man should
be," says Ram defensive coordinator Lovie Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is a businessman. He and Achilles have a successful chain
of auto dealerships in northern Louisiana. Williams is a friend. The
people of his childhood don't have to call Williams. He calls them,
says Manuella Parker, a neighborhood friend and former teacher at
Fortier High.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, Williams makes it seem fun to be a sports fan. In a
week of too much pomp and not so much circumstance, he speaks one
easy truth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm blessed and I'm home at the Dome," he says. A trip earned.</TE>

<LD>My Super Bowl Diary: Day 4</LD>
<LD>   NEW ORLEANS--There are 3,000 members of the media here asking
questions every day trying to learn who will win Super Bowl 36 before
it is played--talking to players and coaches who have been trained
all their lives to tell the media nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Since they were wasting their time, I went to Jackson Square in
the French Quarter, where there are people who can tell you all about
the future if you give them some of The Times' money.</LD>
<TE>   I sat down with Sasha at the corner of St. Peter and Chartres, and
asked if she still sees the grocery store bagger in my future. Who
cares who wins the Super Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   She shuffled the cards, I moved a little cat statue out of the way
so I could take notes, and she told me I had just pushed aside the
goddess of pleasure. I told her I did that six days ago when I left
L.A.--and I can't wait to hear how my wife explains that to her
giggling kids today at the Catholic school where she teaches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ASKED Sasha what's in store for Mike Garrett, and she flipped
over seven cards and said this person needs to "learn how to love by
using wisdom and needs to stop having such an attitude problem," and
since she was batting a thousand, I said, "Do you think I'll ever get
a return call from Steven Sample?"</TE>
<TE>   Sasha pointed to a card with a king standing in front of a raging
fire and said that means "Hell, no." I told her Garrett and Sample
worked at USC, and she said, "My father graduated from USC and he's
an attorney in L.A.--John P. Kightlinger--do you know him?" I told
her I don't hang around with many folks from USC.</TE>
<TE>   I asked if Kevin Brown would ever smile and she turned over two
cards--Dagaz and Eoh--and explained he has a problem receiving gifts
and staying happy. And all this time I thought it was the pins I was
sticking in the voodoo doll. I also asked if she could see Salma
Hayak in my future, and she said, "Hell, no," and now that I think
about it, I don't recall her turning over any cards before coming to
that conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M HERE because of the Super Bowl, so of course I asked some
Super Bowl questions. I sat down in Judy Moon Star's Reading Room,
and while Sports Editor Bill Dwyre won't let me write about Xxxxxxx
Xxxxxxxxx, I felt it was my journalistic duty to ask if she saw
another wedding in Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxx's future.</TE>
<TE>   NBC reporter Jim Gray was jogging by, and he joined me for the
Xxxxxxxxx discussion as Judy Moon Star asked me to pull a card. I
turned over the "seven of slaves," and said, "Yeah, they probably
were," and she said I was mistaken, it was the "seven of staves."</TE>
<TE>   After pulling two more cards, Judy announced "this is him," her
next husband, "the king of swords." Now as Jim Gray is my witness, at
the very moment Judy Moon Star told us to look behind us, and
expecting to see the King of Swords--her next husband--a guy skated
past us playing a guitar and wearing only a cowboy hat and a pair of
underpants with "The Naked Cowboy" written on his behind.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure they'll be very happy together.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I REMEMBER Judy saying something about the wheel of fortune, and
Gray demanding to know if Vanna White figured somewhere in his life
and Judy saying, "Maybe in your next lifetime." I know I'd like to be
listening today when Gray's wife calls, wanting to know just where
Vanna White does figure into his life.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, I asked about Jeanie and Phil. Apparently the cards
suggest they have hit a fork in the road, and if the Laker coach is
going to marry the owner's daughter, it'll happen sometime in the
next eight weeks to eight months. I should have asked if she sees him
proposing to Jeanie in the hot tub during the NBA All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   I was running out of The Times' money, but I also asked Terry the
Tarot if he saw me getting stranded any time soon in Nebraska, and I
was so thankful when he turned over the "Five Wands" instead of the
"Five Hicks." He said he didn't see me ever going to Nebraska and it
was worth the 20 bucks I gave him to say that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I got to Hurkey for my chicken "Bone Reading," he poured some
Highjohn Oil into a little pouch, asked me to hold it with both
hands, and then poured the bones mixed with Cowie Shells onto the
table. He told me the bones had come from a Haitian priest, which was
a relief, because I thought they looked familiar to the ones I had
picked clean a night earlier at Hooters.</TE>
<TE>   He rubbed some of the oil on my hands, held my hands, closed his
eyes and we just sat like that for several minutes. If Mike Ditka had
held hands with Hurkey, for all we know he still might be coaching
the Saints. Of course, if Hurkey had held hands with you know whom,
she might be known as Mrs. Xxxxxxx Hurkey today.</TE>
<TE>   Hurkey said the bones "speak to him," and when I asked if I'd be
able to eavesdrop, he said, "No, you don't have the gift." When I
told Hurkey I had $25, the conversation between the spirits and
Hurkey intensified, and he said I should take a salt bath and step
out backward so all the "negativity" runs down the drain. I have no
idea why he'd think I'd be covered in negativity, but I could tell he
knows what he's talking about, because he said he could see me coming
into some money this June.</TE>
<TE>   I figure it'll take that long to convince The Times I spent $120
trying to find out who will win Super Bowl 36--while never getting
around to asking the question.</TE>

<HD>Now Smith Is Dying to Make a Difference</HD>
<DH>Patriots: Although his team faces long odds against Rams,
it's nothing compared to the running back's journey to title game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Think being an NFL running back sounds like hard work? Try grinding
it out on the 3-to-11 shift in a fabric-dying factory, unloading huge
tubs of soaking cloth, getting so filthy that no amount of soap gets
you clean, standing in place while the rest of the world passes you
by.</LD>
<LD>   Antowain Smith has been there.</LD>
<LD>   Long before he reached the Super Bowl as the New England Patriots'
out-of-nowhere tailback, Smith was a young employee at such a
factory, Gurney's Manufacturing in Prattville, Ala. He postponed a
promising college football career for three years in order to support
his grandparents, John and Clara Smith, who raised him after he was
born to a 16-year-old mother.</LD>
<TE>   "To me, it wasn't a sacrifice at all," Smith said this week,
preparing to play the St. Louis Rams on Sunday in Super Bowl XXXVI.
"It was just something that I truly wanted to do for some very
special people."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, pulled off the scrap heap by the Patriots shortly before
last training camp opened, is a vital component of a team facing long
odds. He's one of the game's better short-yardage runners, and the
Patriots need a big game from him to keep alive their hopes of
hanging onto the ball and keeping the Ram offense off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see the ball in his hands," left tackle Matt Light
said. "When we give him a lot of carries, he has a lot of success.
There's a direct correlation there. When he carries the ball more
than 20 times, we're getting the job done."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots are somewhat similar to the 1991 New York Giants, who
had to find a way to derail the high-flying, no-huddle attack of the
Jim Kelly-led Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV. The Giants kept the
ball on the ground, maintained possession for more than 40 minutes--a
staggering disparity--and won, 20-19.</TE>
<TE>   The defensive coordinator for that Giant team was Bill Belichick,
now coach of the Patriots, whose game plan from that Super Bowl now
rests in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick is ultra-secretive and protects innocuous details about
his team the way most people guard their ATM code. So he made no
hints this week about his Super Bowl strategy. It's only logical,
though, to suggest he wants to keep the ball out of the hands of Ram
quarterback Kurt Warner.</TE>
<TE>   The third-ranked Ram defense is ready for the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time a team can keep our offense off the field, they feel
that they've succeeded," linebacker O.J. Brigance said. "But that's
been the key to our defense, making sure we get the turnovers.
[Defensive coordinator] Lovie Smith's always emphasized turnovers,
turnovers, stripping at the ball, trying to make things happen,
three-and-outs, so that we can get the ball back into our offense's
hands."</TE>
<TE>   Smith is just the man to do that. He rushed for 1,157 yards in 287
carries this season, a respectable 4.0 yards a pop, and gained at
least 100 in four of the last nine regular-season games. At 6 feet 2,
230 pounds, he's stout, powerful and--he hopes--overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, everybody will forget about me and the big boys up
front," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Smith can't forget about his costly turnover in the
first game against the Rams, a 24-17 loss Nov. 18. Late in the second
quarter, he fumbled at the St. Louis four, and the Rams recovered at
the three. The Patriots argued he was down and asked for a replay,
but they lost that challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams went 97 yards for a touchdown, a reversal some St. Louis
players said was the turning point in their season.</TE>
<TE>   "I took that very hard," Smith said. "When I go out there to play
Sunday, of course I want to redeem myself, but I don't want to go out
there and try to do too much to put myself in a bad situation."</TE>
<TE>   He has seen a few of those. Supporting his grandparents wasn't
easy, especially because their only other source of income was a
couple of paltry Social Security checks that barely covered their
medical bills.</TE>
<TE>   Smith first played football as a high school senior, but he was
good enough to garner interest from several schools. He turned them
down, started working at the factory, and didn't go back to school
until after his grandmother died in 1993. He enrolled at Eastern
Mississippi College, a junior college, and tried out for the team.</TE>
<TE>   He quit after the first day of camp.</TE>
<TE>   That might have been the end of his career, had he been able to
arrange a ride home.</TE>
<TE>   "But nobody would come and get me," he said. "I didn't have a car.
Nobody would come and get me. That's the only reason that I stayed."</TE>
<TE>   Good thing he did. He had a 1,000-yard season, was voted JUCO
All-American, and earned an athletic scholarship to Houston. After
two productive seasons there, he was selected by the Buffalo Bills in
the first round of the 1997 draft. That came a few months after the
death of his grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   Smith led the Bills in rushing in 1997 and '98. He finished second
in '99, but fell off the map last season, logging only three starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Bills released him in May and the Patriots, who weren't
expecting much, signed him a month later.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first came to camp, they didn't really know what to
expect," he said. "They just knew once this guy was pretty good. I
had to prove myself all over again. Once I got into camp, my thing is
I was going to get back to where I once was. They gave me the
opportunity to do it. They put the football in my hands and it was up
to me to go out there and produce."</TE>
<TE>   Every so often, when he's running low on inspiration, he takes a
look at the names tattooed on his right arm. His grandparents are
never too far away.</TE>

<HD>There's a Buzz About Murphy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Webb was a teammate of Bill Walton on UCLA's 30-0 NCAA
championship team in 1973. He saw Walton make 21 of 22 shots and
score 44 points in the NCAA final against Memphis State.</LD>
<LD>   So it's easy to understand why it takes a lot to impress Webb.</LD>
<LD>   Eshaya Murphy is winning him over.</LD>
<TE>   Murphy is a 5-foot-11 junior forward at Van Nuys Montclair Prep,
the defending Division V-AA girls' basketball champion. Webb is the
Mounties' coach.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Murphy scored 45 points and had 32 rebounds against
Santa Monica Crossroads. In the next game, she scored 34 points and
had 20 rebounds against Granada Hills Hillcrest Christian. Then came
a 35-point, 22-rebound performance against Cerritos Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess she's trying to show people she has hops," Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy is more than just a leaper. It's her athleticism and
all-around play that have college coaches constantly dropping by
Montclair Prep to watch her practice.</TE>
<TE>   From top-ranked Connecticut to Pacific 10 teams USC and
Washington, the coaches are showing up to express recruiting interest
in Murphy, who leads the Southland in scoring and rebounding with
averages of 32.8 points and 22.8 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so amazing," she said. "I'm shocked. It's overwhelming in a
way. There are so many schools. I love every school. How can I say
no? A lot of people tell me to be cool. Coach Webb told me,
'Connecticut is coming.' Oh my gosh, it puts a lot of pressure on
you."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy is no pushover. At 12, she started playing for a YMCA team
made up mostly of boys. After she made an aggressive drive, one of
the boys got frustrated and pushed her down. He didn't like getting
embarrassed by a girl.</TE>
<TE>   "They were jealous," she said. "Feelings were hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy started to cry but didn't back down.</TE>
<TE>   "I got back up and played," she said. "It made me play harder to
prove them wrong."</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore, Murphy averaged 29.5 points and 17.0 rebounds. The
Mounties had more experience and size last season, allowing Murphy to
play primarily a forward position. This season, she has been learning
to play with her back to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Her rising rebound totals come from tips. Webb jokes that she
plays like former NBA star Moses Malone.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd miss the layup, get the rebound and that's how he padded his
stats," Webb said. "I told [Eshaya], 'You're doing the Moses thing.'
She goes, 'Who?'"</TE>
<TE>   There are not many athletes the caliber of Murphy. She enjoys
entertaining spectators with powerful dribble moves and three-point
shots. Her mother, Pauletta, has been known to shout, "Do a Kobe,"
referring to the Lakers' Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Webb sees Murphy as his team's Walton. She can do just about
anything--except beat him in H-O-R-S-E.</TE>
<TE>   "I can still win because I start shooting hook shots," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, left-hander Eric Moore of Granada Hills Kennedy was
considered among the top pitchers in the City Section. His curveball
was unhittable at times. When the season started, he began to have
arm problems. He stopped throwing. He tried physical therapy. An MRI
exam was inconclusive. No one knew the reason for his pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping time or something would make it go away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The last resort was surgery, and that's what happened on Jan. 3.
Moore was hoping the doctor found something, and he did. A tendon was
pealing away from the joint in his shoulder. A screw was inserted.
Moore awoke from the surgery feeling relieved. The pain will be gone.
He can begin throwing in four months and hitting in three months.</TE>
<TE>   It's bad news that he might miss most of his senior year. But if
he returns to the form of last winter, some college team is going to
have an outstanding pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What happens when you played football at a co-ed high school and
it becomes an all-girls' school?</TE>
<TE>   If you're Lamont Hollinquest, it doesn't matter. Hollinquest, who
graduated from Downey Pius X in 1989 and played football at USC and
with the Green Bay Packers, will have his football jersey retired
Tuesday at halftime of a basketball game involving the newly opened
St. Matthias girls' school.</TE>
<TE>   St. Matthias replaced Pius X, but Hollinquest has continued to
make donations to improve the school's weight room, gym and field
even though there are no boys remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Athletes are athletes," he said. "And I feel like giving
something back to the place where I spent four good years."</TE>

<TE>   Lew Stueck, football coach at Loyola High from 1959-71, is now the
athletic director at Verbum Dei. He's calling upon his former players
to help raise funds for Verbum Dei during a barbecue Feb. 10 from 1
to 4 p.m. at Verbum Dei. He plans to talk about his days running the
single wing offense....</TE>
<TE>   UCLA-bound 6-8 Matt McKinney of Santa Ynez will be sidelined three
to eight weeks after suffering a partial ligament tear in his right
ankle last week in a basketball game against Paso Robles....</TE>
<TE>   Zach Evans, a 6-2 eighth-grade basketball player at Chatsworth
Chaminade Middle School, was selected most valuable player at the
Paul Muff Catholic grammar school tournament held at Encino Crespi.
Evans played on the 14-and-under Maccabi team that won a gold medal
last summer in Philadelphia.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach State Still Has Fullerton's Number</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arrit,t and  Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who root for the underdog had two good reasons to show up for
Thursday's Big West Conference men's basketball game between Cal
State Fullerton and Long Beach State. Neither team has played to its
potential and both were coming off huge conference losses last week,
which further buried them in the conference basement.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach broke one streak but continued another for the Titans,
pulling away for a 77-60 victory before 1,031 at Fullerton. The
49ers, earning their first road victory in 10 tries this season,
received a career-high 30 points from senior forward Travis Reed and
defeated Fullerton for the sixth consecutive time. The victory gave
Long Beach a two-game lead over the last-place Titans for the final
qualifying spot for next month's conference tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "Fullerton is a lot better team than they showed tonight," said
Reed, who played his freshman and sophomore seasons at UCLA. "They've
only been suiting up eight or nine guys and they kind of ran out of
gas at the end."</LD>
<TE>   Fullerton (4-15, 1-9), winless in 11 road games, was without
reserve forward Josh Fischer, who underwent exploratory surgery in
October to examine an irregular heartbeat and missed his fifth
consecutive game because of the recurring condition.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach (7-14, 3-7) made 15 of its first 19 field-goal attempts
and shot 68% from the floor in the first half, but only led by six at
the break. The 49ers kept Fullerton close with 11 first-half
turnovers, and Fullerton's Pape Sow made six of nine shots in the
opening half and scored 17 of his team-high 27 points. Reed, who
began the game second on the 49ers' all-time career field goal list
(.554), made nine of 11 first-half shots and scored 18 points. Reed
made 13 of 16 shots overall, surpassing his previous career high of
26 points, scored last season against Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton cut the lead to 44-42 on Sow's dunk with just under 14
minutes left, but Long Beach went on a 9-0 run and the Titans never
got closer than seven.</TE>

<TE>   UC Irvine 72, UC Riverside 64--Anteater senior guard Jerry Green
had two points with about 10 minutes left in the first half at UC
Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   He quickly remedied that with nine more in the next 71/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Green proceeded to tie the school's career-scoring record and
contributed mightily to the Anteaters' rally past the Highlanders
before 1,163.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine used a 17-5 run in the final 6:25 to overcome a 59-55
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Green finished with 20 points, giving him 1,778 career points. He
is tied with Riverside assistant coach Tod Murphy, an Irvine graduate
who earned the same total from from 1982-86.</TE>
<TE>   "I tied it and he shook my hand," Green said. "He knows I'm
probably going to break it. He's a great guy."</TE>
<TE>   Green's next chance to pass Murphy will come Saturday at Cal State
Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, he and the Anteaters (15-6, 8-2) are just happy to
have finally gotten past Riverside (6-12, 3-7).</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good accomplishment," Green said. "But I'm not worried
about that right now."</TE>
<TE>   The Anteaters were more concerned with staying atop the Big West
standings, something they did thanks to the victory and second-place
Cal State Northridge's 74-58 loss to Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pacific 74, Cal State Northridge 58--The Matadors (8-11, 7-3) fell
out of a tie for the Big West lead as junior guard Demetrius Jackson
scored 20 of his game-high 25 points in the first half to lead the
Tigers (14-6, 6-4) at Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Markus Carr and Curtis Slaughter each scored 14 points for
Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific was in control after building a 38-21 halftime lead.
Northridge cut a 48-28 Pacific lead to 49-35, but the Tigers sank
three consecutive three-pointers to take their biggest lead at 58-35
midway through the half. Pacific made 11 of its 21 three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge got within 14 points four times afterward, but Pacific
responded each time.</TE>

<LD>The big sign alongside Edison Field on Interstate 57 says it all:</LD>
<LD>   TONIGHT'S EVENT IS SOLD OUT</LD>
<LD>   Four times out of four, EA Supercross has filled stadiums this
season, twice at Edison Field, once at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium
and last Saturday night at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.</LD>
<TE>   No. 5, Saturday night at Edison Field, is expected to be the same.</TE>
<TE>   What is the appeal of supercross?</TE>
<TE>   First, for the uninitiated, what is supercross?</TE>
<TE>   It is an encapsulated version of the exciting European sport of
motocross, where races are held over natural terrain well away from
cities.</TE>
<TE>   It has all the ingredients for today's success story--speed,
daring, spectacle, color, athleticism and noise, lots and lots of
noise.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, at the U.S. Motocross Grand Prix in the hills outside of
Carlsbad, Mike Goodwin conceived the idea of packaging the outdoor
excitement and putting it in the Coliseum, where spectators could
enjoy motorcycle racing while sitting down in a clean environment. A
year later he organized what he called the Super Bowl of Motocross,
and in the three decades since it has evolved into cycling's fastest
growing and most successful sport with a new name, supercross.</TE>
<TE>   (Goodwin faces two counts of murder and conspiracy to commit
murder in the 1988 slayings of racing promoter Mickey Thompson and
his wife Trudy. )</TE>
<TE>   In 16 events last year, the American Motorcyclist Assn.-sanctioned
series attracted 791,273 fans, an average of 49,455. Already this
year, attendance has been up at Anaheim, San Diego and Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   But why?</TE>
<TE>   "Watching the start, all those guys revving it up to the first
turn, is the most exciting thing I've ever done in my life," gushed
Diana, a 20ish woman wearing shorts and a halter top partially
covered by a leather racing jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Danny, her companion from La Mirada, said: "I haven't missed a
supercross for 18 years at Anaheim or the Coliseum."</TE>
<TE>   The start of the Indianapolis 500, universally considered the most
exciting moment in motor racing, has three cars abreast as they head
for the first turn.</TE>
<TE>   In supercross, there are 20 riders, lined up side-by-side for a
make-or-break dash to the first turn of a man-made obstacle course
that includes double and triple jumps--some as high as a three-story
building--tight U-turns and a series of whoop-de-doos, which are
closely spaced bumps, similar to moguls in snow skiing, designed to
shake the handlebars out of a rider's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't get the hole-shot, you can feel like a pinball in
the middle of that pack," said defending supercross champion Ricky
Carmichael, who won last Saturday night's event in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Supercross appeals to Generation X, with its extreme sports
attitude, and an older generation of fans from the '70s who
contributed to the off-road and desert motorcycle riding boom of
their era and now enjoy sitting and watching.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a combination of great events, in great locations, with
great athletes performing spectacularly [and] close to the
spectators," said Scott Hollingsworth, AMA chief executive officer.
"It is visually exciting to watch and what separates it from
freestyle jumping is that it is racing. Jumping is only one element.
Speed is another. The combination is addictive."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy McGrath, the sport's best known superstar, has been the
catalyst in its remarkable growth. The winner of seven of the last
nine championships and 74 individual events (next best is Rick
Johnson's 28), the 30-year-old from Encinitas has become a cottage
industry.</TE>
<TE>   He has his own line of riding gear, a toy X-Treme Cycle, a
radio-controlled motorcycle, complete with a figure of McGrath;
X-Treme Motocross, with replica motorcycles featuring race action on
a simulated motocross track; and a Jeremy McGrath line of Hot Wheels.
He even has a signature shoe, the MC1.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeremy has done for supercross what Michael Jordan did for
basketball," said Ken Hudgens, vice president of Clear Channel
Entertainment, promoters of the EA Supercross season. "Every sport
needs a superstar who has personality and helped get the sport out to
people who might not otherwise be interested. Jeremy is not only a
great rider, but he's a great ambassador for supercross."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, McGrath was so dominating that he developed a
spectacular midair trick he called "Nac-Nac," in which he takes one
foot off the foot peg and swings it back over the other side of the
bike, as though he's dismounting the bike in midair.</TE>
<TE>   It was his Nac-Nacs that led to the increasingly popular X Games
sport of freestyle jumping.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whether to call McGrath a breakthrough or a
crossover from supercross to X Games," Hollingsworth said. "Clearly
he is the breakthrough for supercross' increasing popularity and he
is the crossover that has brought a whole new generation of fans.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bob Hannahs of the world are still highly regarded, but
outside the motorcycle industry they are not well known. McGrath has
taken the sport public, so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   Roy Janson, vice president of operations for Clear Channel
Entertainment, seconds the McGrath theory.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that his impact has been significant, for a
couple of reasons," Janson said. "One, he dominated the series for
the decade of the '90s and also, in a way that is not in the record
book, he has been a really wonderful image for the sport. His
professionalism and accessibility to his fans has been remarkable,
considering his successes.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeremy's influence is seen at the turnstiles. Even though he
totally dominated the sport, people came to see him perform, to see
him win. He had the same impact on our sport that Tiger Woods had on
golf."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who was supercross' superstar before wrist injuries cut
short his career in 1991, believes that the sport's popularity is an
offshoot of the off-road motorcycle boom of the '70s when the film
"On Any Sunday" stimulated interest in riding.</TE>
<TE>   "All of those young people who went riding in the desert and the
mountains are grown now and enjoy watching supercross because, having
ridden a bike themselves, they can appreciate the difficulty and the
athletic ability of today's riders," said Johnson, who runs the
supercross.com Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who has ridden at all knows how amazing it is to defy
gravity the way SX riders do every lap. And those people are coming
to the races with their children. I have been amazed how many
families are at supercross events.</TE>
<TE>   "Supercross is also like Winston Cup racing. All the major riders
are at every event, so when you go you see the best, all of them. In
most sports, you only see two teams, or even in golf and tennis, all
the top players are not in every event. In supercross, they're all
there."</TE>
<TE>   They also are available for autographs in the pits before each
event.</TE>
<TE>   Between afternoon practice and the first heat race, teams schedule
signing sessions for their riders. Usually fans are given pictures to
be autographed, but they often bring toys, model motorcycles and
shirts; some even ask to have a rider sign their backs or their arms.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most difficult duties I have as PR director for
Kawasaki is cutting off the line every week," said Tony Gardea, who
had Carmichael last year and this year has 125cc phenom James "Bubba"
Stewart. "If we let everyone in, Ricky and James would be signing for
eight hours."</TE>
<TE>   Hudgens said the autograph sessions serve a double purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "We found a couple of years ago that we had a big problem with so
many people arriving late," Hudgens said. "It created problems with
parking, traffic and getting people seated. We decided if a person
had an event ticket, we would make the pits open to them between
12:30 and 5:30 so they could see the bikes up close and get
autographs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty unique. You couldn't go to a Laker game three hours
early and line up for Shaq's and Kobe's autograph."</TE>
<TE>   Five-time world champion Roger DeCoster, widely considered the
greatest motocross rider of all time when he was winning races in the
'70s, sees his sport benefiting from problems in more conventional
stick-and-ball sports.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sports fans get sick and tired of hearing about salaries
getting so far out of control, ballplayers getting into all kinds of
trouble and all the violence," said DeCoster, a native of Belgium who
now manages of the U.S. Suzuki team.</TE>
<TE>   "The more it sours them on other sports, when they hear about
motocross or supercross, they decide to give it a look."</TE>

<HD>Selection of Brady Draws Little Reaction</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL PLASCHKE and SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The reaction from both teams to the news that Tom Brady would be the
New England Patriot starting quarterback Sunday against the St. Louis
Rams in Super Bowl XXVI was the expected reaction Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   No reaction.</LD>
<LD>   Brady was not surprised, he said, because he feels his sprained
ankle has healed.</LD>
<TE>   "I was out to practice and it felt good," he said, adding that it
was never as bad as it looked. "I could have gone out there and ran
around that second half Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   That's news to all those who watched him hobble through the
celebrations of the Patriots' AFC championship game victory over the
Pittsburgh Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   As for 'losing' quarterback Drew Bledsoe, well, what do you think?</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's a disappointing situation ... obviously, I would
love to be playing in this game," he said. But, "I'm going to do
whatever I can to try to help Tom and help our team get ready to win
the game."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams, meanwhile, reacted with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   "We assumed Brady would be the guy," defensive coordinator Lovie
Smith said. "He's been the starter."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brady said that despite all the pesky questions this week, there
has been one advantage to his sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I've been in the training room getting treatment I
haven't been able to run around Bourbon Street and get in trouble, so
it's probably better for me than most of my teammates," he said. "I'd
probably like to have some of those guys in the training room with
me."</TE>
<TE>   If the ankle begins throbbing on the artificial turf, a strong
probability even though it will be encased in a brace, can Brady
endure it?</TE>
<TE>   Probably, considering he once played for Michigan three weeks
after undergoing surgery to remove his appendix.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a well-manicured team of conservative appearances and
attitudes, Grant Wistrom stands out like a hangnail with his uncombed
blond frizzy hair and unshaven face.</TE>
<TE>   The Ram defensive end said there was method to this hirsute
madness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably not the most attractive thing in the world, but
neither am I, so it works," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New England linebacker Bryan Cox grew up in St. Louis, a
five-minute drive from the domed stadium where the Rams play. Believe
it or not, he feels a little conflicted.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever the St. Louis Rams are playing and I'm not playing, I'm
their biggest fan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing more I want than if I can't win the Super Bowl is
for them to win it. And that's what we have here. I want to win the
Super Bowl more than anything in this world. But if I can't, I can
still hold my head high and have a sense of pride because my hometown
team has."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Barnes, who goes by the nickname "Big Mike," normally works
as a supervisor at a New Orleans mail-sorting company, but this week
he is a driver and security guard for the NFL. About 15 years ago, he
was an outside linebacker at Arkansas Pine Bluff, and played against
Jerry Rice at Mississippi Valley State.</TE>
<TE>   But Barnes' biggest thrill in football came as a fan. When former
Saint kicker Tom Dempsey was lining up for his 63-yard field-goal
attempt in 1970, Barnes was watching from the end-zone bleachers at
Tulane Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   He hopped the wall when the ball was in the air, and one-hopped it
after it sailed through the uprights, setting a record--later matched
by Denver's Jason Elam--for the longest field goal in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that ball clear as day," said Barnes, 41. "I caught it and
a security guard snatched it away from me."</TE>
<TE>   He will never get that ball back, of course, but this week he has
been searching for NFL Films footage of the kick, in hopes of
catching a glimpse of himself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Habitat for Humanity, which builds homes for needy families, got
some help Thursday from two NFL players who stopped by to hammer a
few nails and sign T-shirts for workers.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego defensive end Marcellus Wiley and San Francisco
quarterback Jeff Garcia made an appearance at a site where a
three-bedroom house was being built for the Brooks family, which
includes five children.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't come to test my construction skills," said Wiley, who
wasn't quite as practiced with the hammer as Garcia. "I didn't grow
up in a house. We lived in a little apartment in the Crenshaw
district of Los Angeles that was probably the size of the bedroom
they've got. It felt like a mansion to us."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia grew up in Gilroy, where his home was surrounded by garlic
fields. His father was a football coach who also owned a gravel
business.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of it is just growing up in the country and a small town,"
he said. "It makes me appreciate everything I've been a part of.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up around people who struggled to make a living. And to be
able to come out here and help, even if it's not in my own back yard,
it's worth it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NFL appointed a Super Bowl officiating crew Thursday with 70
years of experience.</TE>
<TE>   The referee will be Bernie Kukar, who worked the 1999 Super Bowl
in Miami and three conference title games. Joining him will be umpire
Jeff Rice, head linesman Mark Hittner, line judge Ron Phares, field
judge Pete Morelli, side judge Laird Hayes and back judge Scott
Green.</TE>
<TE>   Only Phares previously worked in a Super Bowl, in 1995.</TE>

<LD>Barry Melrose, who now lives in Glen Falls in upstate New York and
keeps an apartment in Bristol, Conn., where he works as a hockey
commentator for ESPN, is glad to be back in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   "I always enjoy coming back here," he said.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings play in a different building than they did when Melrose
coached them from 1992 through April 1995. But L.A. rekindles some
fond memories, particularly from Melrose's first season as King
coach.</LD>
<TE>   That was the season the Kings made their only appearance in the
Stanley Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   "You could get a courtside seat at a Laker game," Melrose said,
"but you couldn't get a King ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "I can still remember seeing Bruce McNall before Game 4 of the
finals, shaking his head and looking down. I asked him what was wrong
and he said, 'I've got 24 celebrities looking for tickets and I've
got none left.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hockey is big again in L.A., at least for this weekend, because
Staples Center is the site of Saturday's NHL All-Star game and
tonight's All-Star Celebration.</TE>
<TE>   But it will take more than an All-Star game to turn L.A. into the
hockey town it was when Wayne Gretzky was leading the Kings' glory
run in 1993. And Melrose knows what that is.</TE>
<TE>   "You can market, market, market, and that won't do it," he said.
"Win and they will come. The Kings are starting to do that, but what
this town needs is for both the Kings and Mighty Ducks to be winning
at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Melrose is talking about something more than a five-game streak.
"If both teams start winning consistently over a period of time, it
will bring in the fans and people will be talking hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Busy Broadcaster</TE>
<TE>   Melrose, who has adapted well to his new profession, may be the
most visible broadcaster during the ESPN and ABC coverage of this
weekend's NHL festivities.</TE>
<TE>   During the start of tonight's 2 1/2 hours of coverage on ESPN,
beginning at 6, Melrose will coach one of the teams in the YoungStars
game, which features players 25 and under. Melrose will be wearing a
microphone, which could prove to be interesting.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Melrose will join Gary Thorne and Darren Pang to
describe the SuperSkills competition.</TE>
<TE>   Thorne and Bill Clement will call Saturday's game, which begins at
noon, and Melrose, along with John Saunders and John Davidson, will
be part of the pregame, intermission and postgame shows. Former King
Brian Engblom will serve as the ice-level reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Melrose has been busy since arriving in town Wednesday. That night
the former NHL defenseman played in the All-Star Celebrity Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Melrose, an analyst for "National Hockey Night" and "NHL2Night,"
has been full-time with ESPN since 1996, following successful guest
analyst stints during the playoffs in 1994 and '95. He also has been
working games for ABC since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He says he still gets the itch to return to coaching at times, but
then he sees all the firings.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with coaching is, you're going to get fired. It's
inevitable," he said. "Look at Larry."</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to Larry Robinson, fired this week by the New
Jersey Devils and the person who replaced Melrose when he was fired
as coach of the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "Firings are so common, we joke about it," Melrose said. "But it's
no joke. It plays hell on you. It's tough on you, and it's tough on
your family."</TE>
<TE>   ESPN Books Booker</TE>
<TE>   ESPN sent out a news release Thursday saying that running back
Lorenzo Booker of St. Bonaventure High in Ventura will announce his
college decision live on ESPN's "SportsCenter" Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Wednesday is national signing day for high school seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Booker, who has narrowed his choices to USC, Notre Dame and
Florida State, will be profiled by Shelley Smith on the 10 p.m.
edition of "SportsCenter" on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net will have a national signing day preview Tuesday at
6:30 p.m. A number of players will be featured, including Booker.
Times high school columnist Eric Sondheimer will be part of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net will have a signing day wrap-up show Wednesday at
6:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN Books L.A.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN announced this week that its has chosen L.A. as the new site
for its ESPY Awards show. The 10th edition of the show will be held
July 10 at the new Kodak Theater in Hollywood, site of the Academy
Awards March 24.</TE>
<TE>   The first seven ESPY shows were held in New York, the last two in
Las Vegas.</TE>

<HD>Official: Tyson Fight Would Help Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Although unwilling to speculate Thursday on how he would vote on a
boxing-license application by Mike Tyson, Manuel Soto, chairman of
the California Athletic Commission, said that a proposed Tyson-Lennox
Lewis heavyweight title fight at Staples Center would provide a
much-needed boost to the L.A. economy.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody benefits," Soto said. "This would create jobs. The
President of the United States has said it is important that we
create jobs. How long has it been since we held a fight this big
here? It would bring in money for the hotels, restaurants, air
flights."</LD>
<LD>   Tyson's bid for a license to fight Lewis at Las Vegas' MGM Grand
Garden Arena was denied Tuesday by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission because of Tyson's erratic behavior and his failure to
take steps to correct it.</LD>
<TE>   "I know we would take a lot of flak if we approved it," Soto said.
"People would say we did it for the money. Sure, that's true."</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center president Tim Leiweke says he would be interested
in the match if the commission gave Tyson a license, but promoters
from Denmark and South Africa also have offered to host the
$100-million bout.</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's manager, said he plans to apply to the
California commission. Soto and Rob Lynch, executive director of the
commission, say a special hearing would probably be necessary should
representatives of the former two-time heavyweight champion follow
through with a request.</TE>
<TE>   Soto says he would insist on Tyson being present at such a
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still not committing," Soto said. "It's up to Mike Tyson what
happens. I am going to be shooting questions at him."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest hurdle for Tyson may be allegations he is guilty of
sexual assault in two separate cases in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Soto is one of six California athletic commissioners. Tyson would
need approval from at least four to get a license.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Men's Soccer Coach Gets the Boot</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Saldana is asked to relinquish post after
university officials learn that he does not have a bachelor's degree
from an accredited school, a prerequisite for the job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The coach who guided UCLA to the 1999 NCAA men's soccer Final Four
will not retain his job because his academic degree was obtained from
an unaccredited university, the school announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Saldana, who had a 43-17-4 record and led the Bruins to the
NCAA tournament in each of his three seasons as men's coach, has
agreed to leave his post early, even though UCLA said it would honor
its contract with him through June.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA learned during the recently completed soccer season that
Columbia State (La.) University, the school from which Saldana had
received a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1997, was a diploma
mill.</LD>
<TE>   Columbia State, which offered degrees through Internet
correspondence courses, was shut down by law enforcement officials in
1998--after Saldana was hired by UCLA--for issuing fraudulent
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA requires its head coaches to have a bachelor's degree from an
accredited school. In a statement, Athletic Director Peter Dalis said
UCLA does not believe "that there was any intent on Coach Saldana's
part to mislead the university."</TE>
<TE>   Saldana, 40, could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Bruce
Geld, said Saldana was "disappointed that UCLA didn't choose to renew
his contract. He disagrees with their decision not to give him a
chance to complete his course work, but he respects their decision."</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Saldana said he spent more than a year
completing correspondence courses from Columbia State.</TE>
<TE>   "I understood I was following a prescribed course of instruction
designed by that school to supplement the credits I had already
earned from El Camino [Community] College."</TE>
<TE>   Before taking over the UCLA men's program, Saldana was the Bruins'
women's coach for the 1998 season.</TE>
<TE>   He was Loyola Marymount's men's coach in 1997, coached at Cal Poly
Pomona from 1995-96, and was an assistant at UCLA from 1989-94.</TE>
<TE>   College athletic programs across the nation are placing the
resumes of current and prospective employees under increased scrutiny
after an inaccuracy in George O'Leary's biographical information cost
him the football job at Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Betsy Stephenson, the UCLA associate athletic director who
recommended Saldana's hiring in 1998, said she did not feel it was
necessary at that time to check his educational background.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very highly recommended," Stephenson said. "He was very
well-respected in terms of his coaching abilities."</TE>

<HD>Business Suits USC in Win Over Beavers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Sam Clancy leaned back against a cinderblock wall outside the USC
locker room at Gill Coliseum, tilted his head toward the ceiling and
took a swig of orange juice, a satisfied, if not relieved, look on
his face.</LD>
<LD>   The 23rd-ranked Trojans had avoided a potential pitfall at Oregon
State on Thursday night and defeated the Beavers, 64-51, to remain in
a first-place tie in the Pacific 10 with Oregon, which will play host
to USC on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "We took care of business here," the Trojan senior forward said.
"Normally, I think we come up here and take [Oregon State] lightly.
We really focused this time. Now we've got the biggest game of the
year for first place on national television."</LD>
<TE>   Clancy finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds, all on the
defensive end, for his sixth consecutive double-double and
league-leading 12th of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Senior point guard Brandon Granville also had 17 points, with five
assists, though his consecutive free-throw streak ended at 34 when he
missed with 41.9 seconds to play..</TE>
<TE>   "What streak?" Granville said with a smile. "It was fun while it
lasted.</TE>
<TE>   "But this was a big win. We weren't taking this team for granted.
I think we did a good job of making them worry about our press. That
gets our energy going and that's how we like to play."</TE>
<TE>   Granville had talked earlier in the week about causing chaos on
the court via the full-court press and taking advantage.</TE>
<TE>   It worked to near perfection in the Trojans' win over Stanford
last week and also flummoxed Oregon State, the league's
lowest-scoring team (64 points per conference game), which favors a
slow, half-court game.</TE>
<TE>   In front of 6,065, the Beavers jumped to an 11-10 lead seven
minutes into the game before USC rode its press and a three-guard
lineup--Granville, Errick Craven and Desmon Farmer, along with
forwards Clancy and David Bluthenthal--to a 16-0 run over a
six-minute span. A Clancy basket ended the spree with 4:45 remaining
in the half and gave USC a 15-point lead, 26-11.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Trojans limited the Beavers to two field goals over
the final 13 minutes of the half and a Granville three-pointer from
the top of the key gave USC a 31-16 halftime advantage..</TE>
<TE>   "We knew how they play and we didn't want to walk up the court and
make every play tough," Trojan Coach Henry Bibby said. "We wanted to
get some easy baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "We threw some different defenses at them, different presses, just
to try to keep them off balance."</TE>
<TE>   USC stayed in control early in the second half, going up by a
game-high 21 points, 45-24, on a Granville three-pointer at the 15:22
mark.</TE>
<TE>   But, as can be the case with the Trojans and big leads, they got
comfortable and the Beavers began making shots.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State crept back, eventually closing the deficit to single
digits, 54-45, on a Joe See three-pointer with 4:24 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "They played a little zone [defense] and we got a little
lackadaisical," Clancy said. "They went on a little run and I had to
stop their momentum."</TE>
<TE>   And he did. On USC's next trip down court, Clancy was fouled as he
threw down a dunk.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci, last week's Pac-10 player of the week, finished with 11
points and seven rebounds while committing five turnovers in 33
foul-plagued minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy made the free throw to complete the three-point play and
the Trojans' lead never fell below 12 points the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   USC (16-4 overall, 8-2 in Pac-10 play) may have been held 21.2
points below its conference scoring average, but the Trojans did
shoot 51% from the field while getting 11 steals and causing 17
Beaver turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State (10-10, 3-7) shot 39.6% in losing to a nationally
ranked team for the 12th consecutive time. The Beavers were led by
junior guard Jimmie Haywood's 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to press and not give up some layins and some
open looks," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know as a team that we just need to get through it and not
give up too many easy baskets. When you have a comfortable lead, you
can gamble a little bit more and we did.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to split on the road but now we're getting
greedy--we want two [wins]."</TE>

6-4), which has lost 18 consecutive to Duke.</TE>

<HD>Terrorists Noted Flaws in Security, Report Says</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A confidential intelligence report issued Thursday indicates that
Osama bin Laden's operatives displayed a keen interest in exploiting
vulnerabilities in security at sensitive U.S. facilities, and FBI
Director Robert Mueller said he believes that Al Qaeda-trained agents are
still at large in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The intelligence report, reviewed by The Times, revealed that U.S.
personnel in Afghanistan have discovered an Al Qaeda-linked computer hard
drive containing a congressional study that exposed startling
shortcomings in security at U.S. government facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Also found by U.S. personnel in Afghanistan were news accounts about
the congressional study that had been translated into Arabic, according
to the intelligence report distributed Thursday to U.S. authorities
through the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center.</LD>
<TE>   The intelligence report apparently refers to a study that the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, released publicly
in May 2000 showing how easily infiltrators could get into sensitive U.S.
facilities. Undercover GAO investigators, using bogus police credentials
and fake IDs, managed to gain access to 19 of the nation's most tightly
secured buildings, including the CIA, the FBI, the State Department and
the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO study sparked outrage in Congress, and federal officials say
it prompted them to tighten security substantially at their buildings
even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the hijackings, authorities began warning security
officials at nuclear reactors, military bases and a range of other
federal facilities to use "due care" in identifying official visitors and
not to assume that law enforcement credentials were legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   But the new information from Afghanistan provides perhaps the clearest
indication to date that terrorists have actively sought to prey on
security vulnerabilities, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "What this means is that Al Qaeda types have taken the trouble to
study specific information about physical security weaknesses, as
reported by the GAO," said a law enforcement official who asked not to be
identified. "This is more evidence that we have to treat these people as
sophisticated terrorists because they're clearly doing their homework."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI declined to discuss the discovery of the study in Afghanistan,
and officials at the GAO said they would look into the issue.</TE>
<TE>   With the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City fast approaching, law enforcement officials have ratcheted up
security to guard against possible attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear power plants have been a source of particular concern, as
President Bush revealed in his State of the Union address Tuesday night
that U.S. personnel in Afghanistan have found "diagrams of American
nuclear power plants" and other sensitive facilities. Authorities have
warned reactor facilities to take extra precautions to guard against
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, speaking with reporters Thursday, said the FBI has "moved
heaven and earth to provide security for the Super Bowl and the Olympics,
and I think we've done a good job in enhancing security."</TE>
<TE>   But he added that "we're still in a very high state of alert," driven
in part by the cache of terrorist planning documents and other material
discovered in the rubble of former Al Qaeda compounds in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mueller did not refer specifically to the discovery of the
GAO security report in Afghanistan, he said Americans should be worried
by the "types of schemes" detailed in Afghan documents. "That people were
plotting these various things is substantial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, who just returned from a trip to Afghanistan and the Middle
East, where he visited FBI agents stationed in the region, said
investigators now believe the Sept. 11 attacks were planned in Germany,
Malaysia and "perhaps in other countries."</TE>
<TE>   Although Germany's role as a meeting ground for terrorist ringleader
Mohamed Atta and associates has been widely known for months, Mueller's
comments marked the first time that the Bush administration has publicly
identified Malaysia as a critical site for the plot.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller refused to comment on reports that Zacarias Moussaoui, the
French Algerian in custody in Virginia as an alleged co-conspirator in
the Sept. 11 attacks, had financial and political ties to suspected
terrorists in Malaysia, including a former army captain.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, his comments naming Malaysia as a key site for Sept. 11
planning appear likely to rankle Malaysian officials, who in recent days
have sought to deflect accusations that their country was a staging area
for the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the massive roundup of possible terrorism suspects after the
Sept. 11 attacks, Mueller said Al Qaeda operatives probably remain in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "There may well be those in the United States who, having been trained
by Al Qaeda, can come together with others for a particular terrorist
attack," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I say there are none in the United States? No, I will not say
that. Do I know for sure that there are some in the United States? I
would say that I believe there are, but I cannot say for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller stressed that preventing terrorist attacks is now the FBI's
primary mission, even at the expense of such traditional roles as chasing
down bank robbers and busting drug rings.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to bolster the FBI's operation, Mueller on Thursday
stepped up his long-delayed management reshuffling at the bureau,
appointing two veteran agents to top posts in counter-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Pat D'Amuro, who has headed the Sept. 11 probe and also oversaw
earlier terror investigations, will serve as assistant director for
counter-terrorism, and Tim Caruso, a 23-year veteran, will serve as
deputy executive assistant director for counterintelligence and
counter-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Mueller quietly demoted one of the bureau's
highest-ranking women, Sheila Horan, from her post as acting head of the
national security division. Mueller declined Thursday to discuss his
reasons for the move but said he was "hurt" by reports that he was
dissatisfied with her performance on espionage cases. The reports, he
said, besmirched the reputation of "someone who has had an excellent
career in the FBI."</TE>

<HD>Davis Ads Aim to Cripple Riordan Before Primary</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor says rival opposes abortion rights. Ex-mayor
hopes attacks will backfire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By launching an early and aggressive TV ad blitz, Gov. Gray Davis
is wagering millions of dollars that his reelection team can fatally
wound Richard Riordan even before the Republican primary is decided.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan, by turning the proverbial cheek, is gambling as well--that
Davis' attacks will backfire on an incumbent whose problems stem in good
part from perceptions that he is overly political.</LD>
<LD>   Big-budget ad campaigns are nothing new in California. They are the
only truly effective means of communicating in a state with more citizens
than Canada and a land mass stretching 760 miles.</LD>
<TE>   But the intensity of Davis' TV effort is audacious even by California
standards. He is outspending Riordan--buying more than $1 million in
advertising a week, including prime outlets such as the Super Bowl--even
though the governor has no serious opposition in the Democratic primary.
Riordan faces Republicans Bill Jones and Bill Simon Jr. on March 5 for
the right to challenge Davis in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   For the past week, Davis has pounded Riordan with a series of negative
spots, forsaking the upbeat, self-promotional advertising that normally
ushers in an incumbent reelection campaign. More brazen still, Davis has
intruded in the Republican contest by raising the visibility of the
contentious abortion issue.</TE>
<TE>   His hope is that any damage could undermine Riordan in the GOP
primary--and failing that, harm him in November.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' most heavily seen spot, aimed at wooing back women and
disgruntled Democrats, accuses Riordan of opposing abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   The attack has forced the former Los Angeles mayor, who calls himself
"pro-choice," to explain his conflicting record at the risk of
antagonizing voters on both sides of the touchy matter. Supporters of
abortion rights may question his sincerity, while opponents may be put
off by his defense of legal abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging their influence over the GOP primary, strategists for
Davis have all but invited Riordan's opponents to piggyback on their
efforts. In particular, they would like to see businessman Simon pour
some of his millions into an ad campaign attacking Riordan, hoping Simon
might come from behind and eliminate Davis' most serious rival.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday, however, Simon had yet to substantially boost his
modest TV buy. Plans call for his newest spot to be a positive one,
touting Simon's attributes and steering clear of his opponents. Simon has
said, however, that he will eventually air ads critical of Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Jones, who has the least cash in his
campaignaccount of any major candidate in either party, hopes to begin
selective TV advertising during the final weeks before the primary.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Davis and Riordan fighting for supremacy over the state's
television airwaves--and over who can define Riordan in the minds of
voters.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor launched the first advertising of the race early last
month, a biographical spot that introduced him in glowing terms to
viewers outside Los Angeles. Davis followed about a week later withhis
own self-flattering spot, which he broadcast statewide.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis switched last Friday to the ad attacking Riordan on
abortion, then to advertisements in the Central Valley and Inland Empire
that assail his record on crime. Another spot, accusing Los Angeles of
profiteering during last year's energy crunch, is running in parts of
Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating the assault, Riordan launched an immediate response,
lamenting Davis' tactics and saying, "Californians deserve better."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also was forced to answer Davis' attacks at several campaign
stops this week, which had the effect of stepping on Riordan's preferred
message. Significantly, however, Riordan has chosen not to respond in his
own TV spots.</TE>
<TE>   The move is a risky one, as even Riordan strategists acknowledge.
Democrat Michael Dukakis was sunk by his failure to respond to the
negative advertising of Republican George H.W. Bush. Since their 1988
presidential campaign, the conventional wisdom has held that any attack
that goes unanswered will stick.</TE>
<TE>   "In my line of work you hear a lot of people say negative doesn't
work, they'll 'try to get above this,' " said Bill Carrick, a Democratic
strategist who once worked for Riordan. "That's a prescription to get
your butt kicked."</TE>
<TE>   But the ex-mayor's strategists are counting on a profound shift in
attitudes since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Their sense is that
voters may no longer tolerate the kind of assault the governor has
unleashed, especially given his already poor favorability ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger [for Davis] is that people may not be in the mood for a
lot of negatives right now," said Don Sipple, chief strategist for the
Riordan campaign and a veteran GOP ad man. "It could pile up [Davis']
negatives."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also wants to avoid a tit for tat that could boost Simon and
Jones, who might look civil by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Money is another concern for Riordan, who has not raised campaign
funds at the clip he had wanted. Although he has a substantial personal
fortune, Riordan wanted to avoid dipping into his bank account before the
general election. Davis' early ads could force him to boost his spending
or cede the airwaves to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute Riordan invests a penny of his own, that makes it harder
to raise funds," said Arnold Steinberg, a GOP strategist and former
Riordan advisor. "People can say, 'You just put in $1 million, $2 million
of your own money. What do you need my $10,000 for?' "</TE>
<TE>   Davis, by contrast, starts the campaign with more than $30 million in
the bank, so his financial situation is less acute.</TE>
<TE>   Though it suits the personality of his pugnacious campaign team,
Davis' two-fisted strategy is not without risks. A Los Angeles Times Poll
this week found the governor getting poor marks for his leadership
ability and a middling 47% approval rating--both danger signs for an
incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Another bit of conventional wisdom holds that negative advertising,
though hurting to its target, can splatter back on the candidate placing
the ad.</TE>
<TE>   But the Davis camp, citing another unpopular governor who battled from
behind, professes not to worry about any such backlash.</TE>
<TE>   The model they cite is Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who mixed positive
early ads with spots assailing Democrat Kathleen Brown before her primary
in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "An incumbent is measured against the quality of his competition,"
said Garry South, chief strategist for Davis. "Pete Wilson wasn't
particularly beloved by his countrymen on election day. But he scored a
stunning victory anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, a new, positive Davis spot is set to begin airing today.</TE>

<HD>New Study Defends Mammograms; Doctors Lament Conflicting Signals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES MEDICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mammography continues to be an effective way to reduce deaths from
breast cancer, according to a new analysis of long-term data, and women
should continue to undergo regular screening, several national medical
organizations said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   For women aged 55 and older who were followed for eight to 11 years,
routinely being screened for tumors reduced the risk of death from breast
cancer by 55%, according to the new analysis reported in this week's
edition of the international medical journal the Lancet. For women who
were aged 45 to 54 at the beginning of the study, screening led to a 30%
reduction in deaths, the researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   The new study is the latest--although almost certainly not the
last--word in a confusing debate over the benefits of routine breast
X-rays. Particularly in recent months, the debate has sent conflicting
signals to women over whether they can reduce their risk of dying from
breast cancer by routinely having mammograms.</LD>
<TE>   The long-running debate heated up in October after another study that
was also published in the Lancet. That study, conducted by two
researchers in Denmark, concluded that existing evidence did not prove
that mammograms actually do any good. Since then, a widely consulted
medical reference service for doctors has issued a statement echoing the
conclusions of the Danish study.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy has troubled many cancer doctors. "We are deeply
concerned that the current discussion might deter women from screening"
for breast cancer, said Dr. Larry Norton, the president of the American
Society for Clinical Oncology.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to resolve the issues over mammograms, the society said
Thursday that it would call together all interested parties within the
next two weeks to evaluate all the evidence about mammography and develop
up-to-date guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Until new guidelines can be developed--probably by May--women should
continue to follow the current advice that all women over the age of 40
have an annual mammogram, Norton said. An estimated 50 million women
receive mammograms each year.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint statement, the American Cancer Society, the American
Medical Assn. and eight other health groups made the same recommendation
Thursday. "If women are dissuaded from getting regular mammograms, lives
will be lost," according to the statement, which the groups placed as a
full-page advertisement in the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Last October's study was conducted by Dr. Ole Olson and Dr. Peter
Gotzche of the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen. They analyzed seven
large trials of mammography and concluded that five of them, which had
supported mammograms, were so flawed that their results were meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining two studies, one performed in Malmo, Sweden, and one in
Canada, failed to prove that screening was effective in reducing death
rates, Olson and Gotzche said.</TE>
<TE>   The new study, conducted by a team led by Dr. Claudia Henschke of the
Cornell Medical Center in New York City, rebutted the work of Olson and
Gotzche. The Danish researchers simply did not monitor patients long
enough, Henschke and her colleagues reported.</TE>
<TE>   "Screening does not have an immediate effect," Henschke said. "The
deaths that get to be prevented by screening are in the future, years
away. . . . Therefore, the screening itself must continue for a
sufficiently long time to realize its benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Henschke's team looked at data from the Malmo study, which followed
women for more than six years. The previous analysis by Olson and Gotzche
had not looked at data from such a lengthy period.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue here is that deaths that occur very early in the follow-up
period are deaths that screening has very little opportunity to help
avoid," said Dr. Robert Smith of the ACS.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, when a screening program is first started, many of the
tumors initially detected will have been found too late to cure. As a
result, in the first years of a screening program, little difference will
be found between the death rates of women who have been screened and
those who have not been. Screening helps women whose tumors are found
early and would not have caused death for many years so the benefits
become apparent only after considerable time.</TE>
<TE>   "This, and the weight of so much other evidence, confirms that
mammography is . . . a very good tool we have right now--the most
important tool that can measurably contribute to reducing deaths from
breast cancer," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Another complicating factor in the debate is that all of the clinical
trials under discussion are at least 10 years old--some are twice that
age. Since then, "mammography has improved, and there are better methods
of biopsy for small lesions," said Dr. Peter Greenwald of the National
Cancer Institute. "Hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, surgery and radiation
have all improved. All of these could improve the outcome of mammographic
screening."</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Donald A. Berry of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center said he
finds the new paper unimpressive. "They wanted to find a positive result,
and the only positive result was Malmo," he said. "The question is, 'Is
the paper compelling?' No, it's not."</TE>
<TE>   Berry is in charge of drawing up new guidelines about mammography for
Physician Data Query, an online database sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute. Its recommendations are formed by an independent board and are
not necessarily the same as those of the cancer institute itself.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent meeting, the board of the data query concluded that there
are not enough data available to determine whether mammography is
effective or not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's conceivable that mammography is beneficial," Berry said. "It's
conceivable that it is not. If it is, the benefit is not spectacular. And
while we don't understand if there is a benefit, we do understand that
there is a risk."</TE>
<TE>   The main risk comes from the fact that only 2% to 11% of all
"abnormalities" detected by mammograms actually turn out to be cancer.
That means a lot of women undergo unnecessary subsequent mammograms, as
well as needle aspirations, biopsies and other invasive procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "We think women should be told about both the benefits and the risks
and allowed to choose for themselves," Berry said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a modern-day Dickens, Stephan Paternot witnessed the best and
worst of times.</LD>
<LD>   A year after graduating from Cornell in 1996, the co-founder of Web
site Theglobe.com was worth nearly $100 million. His company's stock set
a Wall Street record when it jumped 606% in its first day of public
trading. At 24, he became emblematic of the cocky boy geniuses using the
World Wide Web to change the rules of business, media and life itself.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, though, Paternot stepped aside as chief executive of
Theglobe.com, and the site shut down a year later after losing millions
of dollars. Gone were Paternot's paper fortune, his fashion-model
girlfriend and the fawning reports on CNBC.</LD>
<TE>   "It suddenly dawned on me that I might get nothing out of this, not a
penny. For all intents and purposes, I was broke. . . . But of course,
everyone still perceived me as a billionaire," Paternot wrote in his
memoir.</TE>
<TE>   His book, "A Very Public Offering: A Rebel's Story of Business Excess,
Success, and Reckoning," is one of many being written by former
dot-commers searching for meaning in the giddy years from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   No one could confuse these tales with Nicholas Nickleby's "demd horrid
grind" amid the filthy, dangerous 19th-century factories of the
Industrial Revolution. These modern journals--including "Dot.Bomb: My
Days and Nights at an Internet Goliath" and "Boo Hoo: A Dot.Com Story
from Concept to Catastrophe"--aspire to be the first drafts of an equally
momentous era that inspired both great technology and terrible
investments.</TE>
<TE>   The books themselves are inherently ironic. The authors once seemed
poised to make old media obsolete. But they had to turn to ink and paper
to memorialize businesses that evaporated in the ether of the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in a digital age, paper matters," said J. David Kuo, author of
"Dot.Bomb" and former Value America executive. "Tactile paper can relay
history better than anything else can."</TE>
<TE>   Some fret that these books--equal parts history, confession and damage
control--present a skewed picture. Rather than provide serious analysis
from inside the dot-com meltdown, most of the authors try to distance
themselves from the billions of dollars in equity that simply
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a celebration of the cluelessness of the people who created
this whole mess in the first place," said Bill Lessard, founder of
Netslaves.com, a Web site catering to the information industry's
technical workers. "Instead of trying to glam their stupid companies on
people, they're trying to glam themselves as products on people."</TE>
<TE>   History, though, is in the hands of those who hold the pen. Despite
their portrayal in magazine articles and television spots as titans of
the "new economy," Paternot, Kuo and others describe themselves as
innocents who got caught up in the euphoria of big dreams and easy money.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the hype, headlines and hysteria, this was just a gold rush
we were in, not a gold mine we had found," Kuo wrote. "We might look like
hip, chic, cutting-edge, new-economy Internet workers, but in fact, a lot
of us were kin to those poor, freezing fools in Alaska who had staked
everything on turning up a glittering chunk of gold."</TE>
<TE>   Online retailer Value America, which touted itself as "the Internet
superstore," sold everything from laptop computers to barbecue grills,
but never actually held inventory. Merchandise was shipped to customers
directly from the suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   But the site's selection was limited, orders could take weeks to
arrive, and the company spent lavishly on advertising--including a NASCAR
sponsorship. When Value America posted a wider-than-expected quarterly
loss in August 1999, Kuo recalled being shocked by the reaction of the
analysts and the business media, which expected better.</TE>
<TE>   "The world had changed," he wrote in his book. "It wasn't just about
revenue anymore. It was about gross margin and controlled losses and
growing revenue. It was like having to grow a real business. No one ever
told us we had to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Paternot's Theglobe.com, one of the first Internet "communities,"
offered online chat and games and personal Web pages for free.
Advertising, subscriptions and a venture into e-commerce wasn't enough to
support the enterprise, which sparked the frenzy of dot-com public
offerings in 1998 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In the last pages of his memoir, Paternot comes to this conclusion
about taking his company public, which ultimately cost investors
millions: "In the final analysis, it was a necessity. It had to be done.
From a personal stance, I sometimes wish I could take it back. But . . .
whatever."</TE>
<TE>   According to Paternot, running a multimillion-dollar dot-com wasn't as
glamorous as the media made it out to be. In his book, Paternot recalls
angry phone calls from investors after the company's stock began to fall.
"Every morning, we'd walk in, ready to face the day, and the first thing
we'd hear was, 'I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I will kill you!' "</TE>
<TE>   For Annie Van Bebber, who sold her Attitude Network Ltd. to Paternot's
company in 2000 in a stock deal, such insight offers little consolation.
The stock certificates now paper her bathroom wall. "We believed in him,
in them, in their entire team," Van Bebber said of Paternot. "And we all
got screwed."</TE>
<TE>   In the book--and even now--Paternot dismisses the concerns of those
like Van Bebber who came up losers investing in Theglobe.com. "I feel bad
for anybody right now sitting in a tough position financially, but I
don't blame myself," Paternot said. "They went in and gambled. I don't
have a single sleepless night over it."</TE>
<TE>   That lack of reflection has led some to question the motive behind the
writings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a job for people who would otherwise be jobless," said Philip
Kaplan, founder of a Web site that tracks dot-com failures.</TE>
<TE>   Kuo said he hoped for a better understanding of himself by writing
about his experience. After starting the book in the summer of 2000, "it
struck me that Value America was the leading indicator of the dot-bomb
bust to come," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Value America, for which Kuo served as senior vice president of
communications, filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2000 after its
stock fell 93% in one year. But by the time his book was published in
October 2001, the bust Kuo anticipated had already come. Dozens of other
Internet executives shared his story.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Weinstein, a San Francisco literary agent, said he has been
approached with several book proposals about dot-coms. Although "most are
personal projects that would not attract a larger audience," Weinstein
said, he would be interested in finding "the right dot-com memoir."</TE>
<TE>   "People are always fascinated by other people's lives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, not always. Reviews of the books have been mixed. Paternot's
book recently ranked 31,957th in sales on Amazon.com. Kuo's showed up at
3,903rd. More than a century after their publication, Charles Dickens'
"Oliver Twist" was at 20,914 and "Great Expectations" was at 6,089.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury's still out as to whether there still is a market for them,"
said Carol Franco, director of Harvard Business School Publishing. Franco
has not signed any deals for dot-com memoirs, but is publishing a book by
Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, founder of GovWorks.com and the subject of the
documentary "Startup.com."</TE>
<TE>   GovWorks.com, which enabled users to pay parking tickets and
government bills online, failed in 2000. Although Tuzman will include his
personal experiences in "Lessons of Early Entrepreneurship," the book
will look much more broadly at how entrepreneurs should start a business.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it may be academics and journalists compiling the early
history of the Web who benefit most from the memoirs. Much of the
information about Internet companies was digitized. But e-mails get
erased, and outdated home pages aren't always archived.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the lack of physical data, it's easier to compile a history
of cinema's first decade in the early 1900s than that of the Web at the
end of the century, said Henry Jenkins, director of the comparative media
studies program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   "The digital space is already gone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stories written by journalists or academics who are "going to take a
step back and draw a second draft of history" would have much broader
appeal, Weinstein said. Books that analyze the Internet boom in the
context of other times of economic prosperity--the 19th-century gold rush
and the aerospace boom of the 1960s, for example--are "going to grab us
that much more."</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks after the books were published, dot-com tracker Kaplan
had two of the dot-com memoirs sitting on his desk but hadn't gotten
around to reading them.</TE>
<TE>   "If they make all these books into movie format, I'll definitely see
them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He may get the chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Boo-Hoo" author Ernst Malmsten said he already has sold movie rights
to his book about the failure of online retailer Boo.com.</TE>
<TE>   And Paternot, who is now represented by a talent agency, is packaging
a movie deal based on his book. In the meantime, he is pursing an acting
career. This month, he will begin shooting an independent feature film in
New York, in which he plays a con artist.</TE>

<HD>U.S. and Philippines Launch Joint Hunt for Islamic Gang</HD>
<DH>Military: American troops will be in the field as trainers. Critics
see a bid to thwart the Asian nation's constitution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANILA
</DL>
<LD>It's called "Balikatan," or "Shoulder to Shoulder," and it will
soon be the biggest U.S. military operation in a combat zone outside
Afghanistan since the war on terror began.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon has committed 650 soldiers, including 160 Special Forces
troops, to help the Philippine government track down and defeat the
ruthless Abu Sayyaf, a gang of Islamic kidnappers that may have links to
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Balikatan, formally launched Thursday, is billed as a military
exercise to train Philippine soldiers, but these will be no ordinary war
games. U.S. troops will carry live ammunition and accompany Philippine
forces into the field as they hunt down the Abu Sayyaf.</LD>
<TE>   The Americans will remain for at least six months, and their stay
could be extended to a year.</TE>
<TE>   A yearlong military exercise in a combat zone might have been
unprecedented before Sept. 11, but the attack on the United States has
changed the way armies must work together, said Roilo Golez, Philippine
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's national security advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot talk in terms of pre-9/11 precedents now," Golez said in an
interview. "The concept of war is different when it comes to
international terrorism. Faceless enemies, different strategies,
different agenda, different weapons, different targets.</TE>
<TE>   "And in the case of Abu Sayyaf, they have a different approach in
terrorizing the world. All Americans are targets."</TE>
<TE>   Golez said fears of the United States getting stuck again in Southeast
Asia in a conflict like the Vietnam War are unfounded. In the
Philippines, he noted, the opposition is not a nation with a
well-organized army but a band of rebels numbering in the hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   The joint exercise began against the backdrop of the recent discovery
of a Southeast Asian terrorist group affiliated with Bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network. But investigators here have found no link between the Abu Sayyaf
and the group, Jemaah Islamiah, which has been operating in the
Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   In Manila, a scuffle broke out between police and about 50 people
demonstrating in front of the U.S. Embassy in the latest of small, almost
daily protests against the training exercise. Police made no arrests.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Philippine officials launched the exercise in the Philippine
city of Zamboanga with a joint ceremony at the army's heavily guarded
southern command headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to launch a round of exercises and training designed to
enhance the capabilities of both of our armed forces and to help the
armed forces of the Philippines hone their skills to eliminate the Abu
Sayyaf scourge," acting U.S. Ambassador Robert Fitts said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 U.S. troops have arrived so far, with the remainder
expected in the next few weeks. The United States has also shipped
helicopters and new weaponry to the region to supplement the Philippine
army's outdated equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, seeking to broaden its war on terrorism,
selected the Philippines as its next target in the hope of quashing the
Abu Sayyaf, which is holding two U.S. missionaries and a Philippine nurse
hostage.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of U.S. forces has touched off a heated debate over
whether the use of American troops in a combat situation should be
considered a military exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Some consider the joint operation a transparent attempt to circumvent
the Philippines' constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippines evicted the U.S. military from its bases here 10 years
ago, and the nation's constitution prohibits foreign troops from
operating on the soil of the former U.S. colony. However, the
constitution allows for military exercises staged under a treaty with a
foreign country.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo has welcomed Washington's help in defeating the Abu Sayyaf,
whose ability to outwit government forces has been a continuing source of
embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine military has been trying for much of the last year to
crush the Abu Sayyaf, which has kidnapped dozens of people from resorts
in the country and in neighboring Malaysia and held them for millions of
dollars in ransom.</TE>
<TE>   The group seized Kansas missionaries Gracia and Martin Burnham in May
from a seafront hotel on the Philippine island of Palawan, where the
couple were celebrating their 18th wedding anniversary. The kidnappers
took them by speedboat 300 miles to the island of Basilan, where the Abu
Sayyaf is thought to still be holding them in the dense jungle.</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf beheaded another hostage taken in the raid, Guillermo
Sobero of Corona, Calif., in June. The group has also kidnapped dozens of
Filipinos, holding some for ransom and beheading others.</TE>
<TE>   Golez said the government is eager to eradicate the Abu Sayyaf because
it is scaring off investors and damaging the economy.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,800 Philippine troops will take part in the joint exercise.
Some of the training will take place on Basilan, about 560 miles south of
Manila. The remainder will take place in Zamboanga, on Mindanao island,
about 15 minutes by helicopter from Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   During the exercise, U.S. Special Forces troops will go on patrol with
Philippine soldiers but will stay to the rear to minimize their chances
of encountering the Abu Sayyaf. The U.S. troops will be armed for
"self-defense," officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Golez said he doubts that the Americans will be drawn into any
fighting, in part because their high level of training will help them
avoid danger. During the fighting in Afghanistan, he pointed out, only
one U.S. soldier has been killed in combat.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine army has had difficulty locating the kidnappers in the
dense jungle of Basilan in part because it lacks sophisticated equipment.
Its helicopters, for example, aren't equipped to fly at night, but that
is the only time when heat-sensing devices could zero in on the
kidnappers.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the purpose of the exercise is to train Philippine soldiers in
the use of the high-tech weaponry the U.S. forces are bringing with them.
Officials would not discuss the nature of the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The United States says that Abu Sayyaf is connected with Bin Laden,
but the links are unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The group's founder, Abdujarak Abubakar Janjalani, trained in
Afghanistan and fought in the Central Asian nation against Soviet
occupation forces in the 1980s, but there is no indication that he knew
Bin Laden there. A devout Muslim, Janjalani formed Abu Sayyaf on his
return to the Philippines to fight for the establishment of an Islamic
state in the southern region of the country.</TE>
<TE>   During the mid-1990s, Bin Laden's brother-in-law, Mohammed Khalifa,
was active in organizing Islamic groups in the Philippines and may have
provided financial assistance to the group. But after police killed
Janjalani in December 1998, the Abu Sayyaf lost its Islamic fervor and
shifted its focus to making money from kidnappings.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine government has found "no overt evidence yet" of a
connection between Abu Sayyaf and Al Qaeda, Golez said, but that doesn't
mean such a connection doesn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Jones, the sister of hostage Gracia Burnham, arrived in Zamboanga
on Monday and appealed for the couple's release. She said the Burnhams
are unable to pay ransom.</TE>
<TE>   "Martin and Gracia have never hurt anyone," she said. "They are
missionaries and have lived a good portion of their lives in the
Philippines helping the Filipino people. They are both very kind and
generous and love the Filipino people."</TE>

<HD>Despite Recession, Perks for Top Executives Grow</HD>
<DH>Pay: Hidden benefits mushroom as employees' retirement plans
shrink.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lavish retirement plans, low-interest loans and other
perquisites showered on Enron Corp. managers have put a spotlight on a
growing corporate trend--one of ever-richer executive benefits packages
whose costs often can be hidden from shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   Compensation experts say companies are increasingly using executives'
benefits packages, which already are far more generous than those offered
to rank-and-file workers, as a way to quietly beef up total pay for top
managers regardless of how their company performs.</LD>
<LD>   Sumptuous paychecks for executives are nothing new. But shareholder
activists say weak regulatory requirements, along with a faltering stock
market, are leading to unchecked growth in executive retirement plans and
other benefits even as lower-ranking workers face losses and cutbacks in
their own plans.</LD>
<TE>   "The trend has been [for executives] to be greedier and greedier, even
though there's a recession," said Cynthia Richson, director of corporate
governance for the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. "All this is
designed to keep executives whole while the rank and file loses ground."</TE>
<TE>   As many workers' 401(k) retirement plans shrink, executives at some
companies get guaranteed returns on their investments. Other companies
pour hundreds of millions into special executive-only retirement
accounts. Firms also pay for big insurance policies and offer executives
multimillion-dollar loans, complete with below-market interest rates and
a company promise to forgive some of the payments.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike salaries, bonuses and stock options--which must be laid out in
government filings--the true cost of these benefits is often difficult,
if not impossible, for outsiders to determine, said Ken Bertsch, director
of corporate governance for TIAA-CREF, the world's largest pension fund
manager.</TE>
<TE>   For a variety of accounting and regulatory reasons, companies often
are not required to report the price tag for many of their executive
benefits to the Securities and Exchange Commission. When benefits are
disclosed, their costs can be tucked into footnotes or lumped into a
catchall category of "other compensation," said Nell Minow, editor of the
Corporate Library, which tracks compensation trends.</TE>
<TE>   The costs of many executive retirement plans are particularly easy to
hide, since companies have to reveal few details, compensation experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The regulatory disclosure rules are so weak, [companies] can get away
with one or two ambiguously worded sentences in the middle of a paragraph
about the rank-and-file [retirement] plan," Richson said.</TE>
<TE>   These feeble disclosure requirements, combined with poor stock market
performance, have spawned a cottage industry in the last year of
compensation consultants who are promoting supplemental executive
retirement arrangements, benefits experts said. These plans are designed
and promoted specifically as a way to enhance compensation that's "off
the radar screen of shareholders," Richson and other compensation experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike stock options or bonuses, which are tied to the company's
performance, executives benefit from these supplemental retirement plans
whether or not the company does well.</TE>
<TE>   Executives can lose these retirement benefits if the company declares
bankruptcy, since the plans are not protected by the government-run
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. But shareholder activists say most
executives are at little risk because relatively few companies actually
go broke.</TE>
<TE>   Companies say they need to offer ample benefits to attract and retain
top-flight managers. In addition, many of the plans designed for
rank-and-file workers don't provide enough retirement pay for executives
used to living on much higher salaries, compensation consultants said.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional pension plans limit benefits to highly paid executives
because the plans can take into account no more than $200,000 of salary
when determining benefits. The IRS also requires companies to cap the
401(k) contributions of their highest-paid workers, so many executives
are prevented from making the full $11,000 annual contributions the law
otherwise allows.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of the executive retirement plans Mercer surveyed in 1998
made up for the benefits that otherwise would have been lost to IRS
rules, said Janet M. Den Uyl, head of executive benefits and compensation
for William M. Mercer Inc., a compensation consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The 40% of companies that offer richer plans--either to all their
executives or to their top one or two leaders--often are trying to lure
talent from other firms or prevent defections, Den Uyl said.</TE>
<TE>   The richest arrangements of all, not surprisingly, are aimed at the
companies' top leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more license at the CEO level," Den Uyl said. Most CEOs
already have rich compensation packages, "and they're not ready to throw
those away" when hired by a new company.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the non-salary perks companies have made available to
top managers:</TE>
<TE>   * Guaranteed returns on investment. Top executives at Enron could
contribute salary and bonuses to so-called deferred compensation accounts
with guaranteed minimum annual returns of 12%. Struggling
telecom-equipment giant Lucent Technologies Inc. has a similar plan that
promises to pay five percentage points more than the 10-year Treasury
rate. Currently, that Treasury rate is about 5%, which means Lucent
executives in the plan get a 10% return on their investments.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and Lucent are far from alone. About half the companies that
offer deferred compensation plans provide a guaranteed minimum return,
according to a Mercer study.</TE>
<TE>   * Bigger company matches. The typical company match for a 401(k)
defined contribution plan is 50 cents for every dollar the employee
contributes, up to 6% of the worker's salary. For a worker who takes full
advantage of the company match, the employer's contribution represents 3%
of his or her pay, or $1,500 a year for a worker making $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The company contribution for an executive version of a 401(k) is
typically 60% higher. The average company contributes 5%, and nearly half
of the companies surveyed contribute even more, the Mercer study found.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar amounts contributed can be substantial. Intel Corp.
contributed $1.3 million to the defined contribution accounts of its top
five executives in 2000, including nearly $400,000 to the account of
Chief Executive Craig R. Barrett, whose salary and bonuses that year
totaled $3.4 million. But unlike many other firms, Intel makes such
contributions for all of the about 10,000 employees whose ability to
contribute to the regular 401(k) is restricted, Intel spokesman Chuck
Mulloy said.</TE>
<TE>   * Huge low-cost loans. SEC filings show telecom company Global
Crossing Ltd., which filed for bankruptcy protection this week, made an
$8-million loan to then-Chief Executive Thomas J. Casey in November 2000
and a $1.8-million loan to President David Walsh in March 2001. Both
loans were secured by the executives' homes, but the interest rates they
paid--6.01% for Casey, 4.75% for Walsh--were three to four percentage
points below prevailing rates on standard home equity loans at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, frequently tapped a
$7.5-million line of credit he could repay with company stock that Enron
had given him or that he had purchased with low-cost company-provided
options. His predecessor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, was given a $2-million
loan. Enron had offered to forgive the payments if Skilling stayed with
the company until Dec. 31, 2001, but he resigned Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   * Lavish life insurance. Many workers get some life insurance through
their employers--typically $50,000 or one year's pay.</TE>
<TE>   Executives can get much more. About one-quarter of companies in the
Mercer study have special executive life insurance programs that
typically pay for coverage equal to three to four times the executives'
annual pay.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the benefit is much higher. In 2000, Cendant Corp., a travel
and real estate company, paid $3.7 million in premiums on a $100-million
life insurance policy for its chief executive, Henry R. Silverman, 60.
Under the arrangement, known as a split-dollar policy, Cendant will
recoup its premiums from the life insurance proceeds when Silverman dies,
with Silverman's heirs receiving the rest of the money, according to
Cendant's latest SEC filing.</TE>
<TE>   * Company-paid taxes. Companies pay a variety of tax bills for certain
executives. When benefits are so great that they incur a tax bill from
the IRS--as they often do--some executives are given money to pay the
tax. Because that cash payment also incurs income tax, companies often
add an additional sum to cover the extra tax--a process known as
"grossing up."</TE>
<TE>   Lucent Chairman Henry B. Schacht was given $57,325 to pay tax on
"certain fringe benefits" in 2000, according to the company's SEC
filings. Ray R. Iritani, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, was
reimbursed $486,918 for taxes in 1999--and $95,000 for tax preparation
services, SEC filings show.</TE>
<TE>   * Fringe benefits. Other perks, such as the personal use of corporate
jets, company-provided chauffeurs and company-paid financial planning,
can add tens of thousands of dollars to an executive's total
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The footnotes of Lucent's SEC filings show the company paid $26,351
for personal financial planning advice for Schacht in a year in which he
received a $1.1-million paycheck. At Enron, Lay's personal use of a
corporate jet in 2000 was worth $334,179.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholder activists note that many of the most lavish arrangements
have been uncovered at companies that have since hit hard times--among
them Enron, whose compensation philosophy, according to SEC filings, was
"to reward executive performance that creates long-term shareholder
value."</TE>
<TE>   "At a minimum, it's inconsistent for companies and executives to just
keep feasting" when financial performance falters, stock prices drop and
other employees face cutbacks, Richson, of the Wisconsin Investment
Board, said. "It's bordering on unethical."</TE>

<HD>Bush Not Budging on Terror Warning</HD>
<DH>Security: President says the U.S. might not be the sole target of
violence. He puts uncooperative nations on notice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Facing criticism over his warning that an "axis of evil" threatens
world peace, President Bush said Thursday that nations other than the
United States could be targets of mass terror. And he put terrorist
nations on notice, saying, "They better get their house in order."</LD>
<LD>   His remarks helped heat up the diplomatic climate as the White House
led a daylong effort to answer critics, including long-standing allies,
who have raised concerns that the United States is on the verge of
expanding its war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The president was unyielding in his response. He said the United
States would hold accountable terrorist nations that develop chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons or the means to deliver them. "The rest of
the world needs to be with us," he said, "because these weapons can be
pointed at them just as easily [as] at us."</LD>
<TE>   In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Bush declared that
Iraq, Iran and North Korea "and their terrorist allies constitute an axis
of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world." He suggested that
the United States was prepared to initiate military action if such
threats were deemed serious enough.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, administration officials stressed that Bush was not
about to take military action against Iran, Iraq or North Korea and that
there had been no change in policy.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday, his aides said his original remarks had been carefully
prepared. They were written, the aides said, to send notice that the
initial military success in Afghanistan did not mean that the United
States was becoming complacent. Washington, they said, remains alert to
the danger of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of its enemies.</TE>
<TE>   The slightly different interpretations of Bush's Tuesday night remarks
reflected a behind-the-scenes contest within the administration over the
direction of the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Although State Department officials argued that the speech meant a
change in priority but not in policy, Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld said the speech pointed to the need for action to avert an
imminent danger.</TE>
<TE>   Internationally, the use of the term "axis" to describe Iran, Iraq and
North Korea raised eyebrows with its echoes of World War II's Axis
powers, Germany, Italy and Japan. It appeared to cast the three "axis of
evil" countries in the same light, even though current U.S. allies such
as Germany have ties to Iran, and South Korea has staked much on a
rapprochement with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Some foreign policy experts argued that Bush's language went too far
toward demonizing the regimes, considering that at least two of the
countries, Iran and North Korea, could still be influenced by diplomatic
pressure from the West.</TE>
<TE>   Some compared it to President Reagan's description of the Soviet Union
nearly two decades ago as an "evil empire."</TE>
<TE>   Ivo H. Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think
tank, said Reagan's phrase was "not particularly well received" and noted
that Reagan had shifted his view within a few years on the possibility of
negotiations with the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in Washington for a meeting with
Bush, said he believes that a dialogue with pro-Western elements in the
Iranian government would be productive and that military action against
Iraq would be a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   But Schroeder said he doesn't believe that Bush intended to identify
new targets for military action, and he predicted that the speech won't
set back efforts to bring about change in the three countries.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder added that as a German, he was "indeed aware" of the
historical resonance of the word "axis." Yet, "I didn't think that the
historical allusion . . . is the one that was intended."</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, although the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair has
voiced no criticism, some lawmakers from Blair's Labor Party pointed out
that Bush's tough approach doesn't mesh with their nation's recent effort
to foster better relations with Iran and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, Britain opened an embassy in Pyongyang, the North Korean
capital, and in September, Foreign Minister Jack Straw marked an
improvement in relations with Iran by visiting the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We in the United Kingdom tend to see foreign affairs as less of a
struggle of good against evil," said Donald Anderson, a Labor Party
member and head of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said Bush's speech appeared to foreshadow military action,
and he warned that such a step would risk losing support from usually
loyal international backers.</TE>
<TE>   "The sheriff may find [that] some of his posse are not around,"
Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   But in speeches in Daytona Beach, Fla., and Atlanta, Bush worked up to
a full-throated defense of that warning. He declared that the United
States won't flag in its campaign "to find the enemy where they hide and
bring them to justice."</TE>
<TE>   "I know some of the people around the world are saying, 'Well, you
know, he can't possibly mean that, now that they've looked like they're
successful in Afghanistan. Gosh, don't you think it's about time they
just kind of go on home?' " the president said.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he answered. "This great nation has been given a chance in
history to make the world more free. And I promise you we'll seize that
opportunity. We'll be wise and deliberate about how we pursue our grand
objective. But we'll pursue it."</TE>
<TE>   His stops Thursday, scheduled to promote volunteer work by older
Americans and the Teach for America corps that sends young teachers into
poor neighborhoods, completed a two-day trip following the State of the
Union address. He also spoke to supporters at a rally at a downtown
Atlanta hotel.</TE>
<TE>   He used his bluntest language at the rally.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're one of these nations that develops weapons of mass
destruction, and you're likely to team up with a terrorist group, or
you're now sponsoring terror, or you don't hold the values we hold dear
true to your heart, then you, too, are on our watch list," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'What does that mean?' It means they better get their
house in order is what it means. It means they better respect the rule of
law. It means they better not try to terrorize America and our friends
and allies, or the justice of this nation will be served on them as
well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national security advisor, ticked off the
administration's complaints in a speech to the Conservative Political
Action Conference in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, she said, "is now the world's No. 1 merchant for
ballistic missiles, open for business with anyone, no matter . . . the
buyer's intentions."</TE>
<TE>   She said Iraq "remains a regime determined to acquire these terrible
weapons."</TE>
<TE>   And Iran's support "of regional and global terrorism and its
aggressive efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction belie any good
intentions it displayed" when it supported the anti-terror campaign
immediately after Sept. 11, Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these nations have a choice to make, to abandon the course
they now pursue," Rice said. "We will use every tool at our disposal to
meet this grave global threat."</TE>

<HD>Safety First at Economic Meeting</HD>
<DH>Security: In Manhattan, organizers seek to avoid disruptive
protests that have marred similar gatherings elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Street protests, airport-style X-ray machines and a blue sea of
police uniforms greeted dignitaries as they arrived Thursday for the
opening of the World Economic Forum.</LD>
<LD>   Security was so tight that even the guests--a who's who of the worlds
of business, diplomacy, academia and media--had to go through metal
detectors to enter the hotel. They were issued special interactive
identification passes encoded with their photograph and pertinent data.</LD>
<LD>   While corporate chieftains and others waited, the cards were scanned
and their pictures appeared on a television screen.</LD>
<TE>   The extensive precautions were intended to prevent anti-globalization
demonstrators from disturbing the conference attendees, who were
protected not only by police, the FBI and Secret Service but by scores of
private bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   "There were four levels of security. There were dogs. There were
people with submachine guns inside and outside the hotel. The security
check was as extensive as I have ever seen," said Robert L.
Dilenschneider, a public relations executive who has attended the
conference, normally held in Davos, Switzerland, for more than 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to take the wallet out of my pocket, my pens, my money clip,"
he said. "I wear suspenders. We had a little bit of a discussion whether
my suspenders set off the machine."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where the conference is being held,
the atmosphere was relaxed even though employees ranging from managers to
waiters and maids wore serious-looking identification badges designed to
prevent intruders. While delegates mingled, visited hospitality suites
and attended meetings, it was evident that detectives were guarding
lobbies, hallways, elevators and staircases.</TE>
<TE>   Participants were also screened when the conference was held in Davos,
but the limited access by road and by railway made it easy to seal off
that village.</TE>
<TE>   In populous New York, however, police banned traffic on a broad swath
of streets near the hotel. On some of the blocks, officers turned away
people who couldn't show proof that they were either attending the
meeting, were residents or worked in the area.</TE>
<TE>   This produced complaints from some owners of shops and restaurants who
said the precautions caused profits to plummet. Business was so bad that
some stores just closed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is killing me. It's a disaster," lamented Silvio Gamba, the owner
of Cinquanta, an Italian restaurant near the hotel. "They say this
meeting will pump millions of dollars into the city, but I have 20
employees for three tables."</TE>
<TE>   But other nearby restaurants prospered as corporations entertained
conference guests.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to a reception at the Four Seasons for Allied Security
and had lunch, the security going in and out was intense,' Dilenschneider
said.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the police presence overshadowed demonstrations--expected to
grow over the weekend--protesting globalization and other causes. The
meeting ends Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Workers in offices along Park Avenue gazed down from windows at a
dozen members of the Friends of the Earth group. Nearby, in a cold but
light rain, several hundred practitioners of the Falun Gong movement--a
religious group that the Chinese government has banned--chanted and
performed exercises.</TE>
<TE>   In the late afternoon, about 1,000 union members and other
demonstrators marched to a Gap store on Fifth Avenue to protest labor
practices and low pay for workers at the chain's suppliers abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "The global economy does not work for the working people," AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney said at a meeting before the rally began.</TE>
<TE>   Police have promised a swift and massive response to violence such as
occurred during anti-globalization demonstrations in Seattle; Genoa,
Italy; Philadelphia; and Quebec City.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, police made eight arrests, including five women who were
charged with trespassing and reckless endangerment for climbing to the
rooftop of a building in lower Manhattan and displaying a banner saying,
"Bush and big biz agree that people with AIDS drop dead."</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who assured forum organizers in
October that he was confident that the city's 40,000-member police force
could deal with all contingencies, repeated his message Thursday while
attending the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "The Police Department and the infrastructure you see here is used to
handling a meeting like this," he said. "I expect the meeting to be
peaceful, and I expect if it isn't, it will be handled very, very quickly
and you won't even know it."</TE>

<HD>Outlook for 2002 Growth Is Overcast</HD>
<DH>Forum: Economists at a New York gathering predict upturns in U.S.
and Western Europe. The global picture, however, is grim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Nearly 3,000 business and political leaders from around the world
packed into a heavily guarded Manhattan hotel Thursday to hear
economists, scholars, bankers and diplomats paint a not terribly cheery
picture of the prospects for global growth and stability in the coming
year.</LD>
<LD>   The litany of warnings given on the opening day of the World Economic
Forum was daunting:</LD>
<LD>   America's declaration of war against the Al Qaeda terror network and
the militant Islamic groups Hezbollah and Hamas will further widen the
rift between the industrialized West and Islamic East, some experts
warned.</LD>
<TE>   The AIDS epidemic in Africa is a "slow-motion holocaust" that
endangers not just Africans but also the moral health of wealthy nations
that could stop it but don't, a panelist angrily charged.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's implosion could trigger additional large corporate failures as
creditors question balance sheets and flee from risk, a respected
corporate analyst argued.</TE>
<TE>Economic Ramifications of the Sept. 11 Attacks</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center have
taken an even bigger economic toll: The worldwide drop in business travel
and long-distance vacationing appears likely to persist, surveys cited
here suggest, harming the airline and hotel industries in scores of First
World cities and developing-world resorts. Insurance costs are soaring
for what real estate professionals term "trophy properties" in major
cities.</TE>
<TE>   And although the U.S. economy appears poised for a modest upturn later
this year, and Western Europe may slightly outpace the United States,
that won't be enough to turn the world economy around in 2002, economists
here suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Japan will remain mired in its decade-long recession, they said, while
the Argentine economic crisis will hamper Latin America's recovery. And
the next trade-fueled growth spurt in China is probably a few years away.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this air of foreboding, there was also an undercurrent of
defiant celebration at the gathering at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the
first large meeting of the international business elite since the
September attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to move the forum from its longtime home in Davos,
Switzerland, was "an act of friendship and partnership, from Switzerland
to New York," said Klaus Schwab, the Swiss professor who started and
still runs the annual gathering.</TE>
<TE>   New York Gov. George Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and his
predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, addressed the group Thursday night to
express their gratitude for holding the meeting in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Spend a lot of your money while you are here," joked Giuliani, who
received a standing ovation. "We would like you to leave as much of it as
you can afford right here in the New York economy."</TE>
<TE>   The forum, which will conclude Monday, may be at once an act of
economic solidarity with New York and an occasion for serious
philosophical reflection on the state of the world, but it is also a
party, an oddly glamorous fusion of a meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and a Truman Capote ball.</TE>
<TE>   Insulated from protesters across the street and invisible to
journalists next door, celebrities rubbed shoulders with other
celebrities and the hundreds of more obscure corporate types whose
companies paid $25,000 to send them here.</TE>
<TE>   Announced attendees included rock stars of the business world--from
Bill Gates and Larry Ellison to Jean-Marie Messier and Michael Dell--and
and of politics--from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and
Bill and Hillary Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   For good measure, there was a handful of real stars, from Bono of the
group U2 to Peter Gabriel and Lauryn Hill, who would entertain the crowd
at an evening gala. (And no glittery New York gathering would be complete
without at least one Baldwin brother--in this case, according to the
list, Alec.)</TE>
<TE>Forum, Uprooted From Davos, Draws Returnees</TE>
<TE>   There were also the serious unscripted encounters that have kept
participants coming back to Davos forums.</TE>
<TE>   In one, Harvard social historian Samuel P. Huntington, who is
celebrated for warning of a "clash of civilizations" between the Islamic
East and the Christian West, was challenged from the audience by Amr
Moussa, the Egyptian diplomat who heads the Arab League.</TE>
<TE>   Accused of "insulting" Islam and overlooking such all-Christian
conflicts as Northern Ireland, Huntington asserted that these internecine
disputes lack the "cosmic significance" of Muslim confrontations with the
West.</TE>
<TE>   But both the content and the logistics of the forum's inaugural
session were dominated by security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, police barriers blocked traffic for blocks around the
landmark 19th century hotel, keeping protesters as well as commuters at
bay, while inside the forum, guards laboriously checked cameras, laptops
and cell phones as if the participants were boarding a threatened
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The forum's usual focus on global investment and technology trends was
refracted through the lens of security fears, with discussions about
prosperity in developing nations driven more by a sense of self-defense
than idealism or the desire for new markets.</TE>
<TE>   On one panel Thursday--titled "A Safer World: How Do We Get
There?"--analysts advocated the expansion of the Middle Eastern middle

<HD>Fiery Leftists Hold Their Own Forum</HD>
<DH>S. America: Social activists from around the world gather in Brazil
as a counterpoint to elite N.Y. economic meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil
</DL>
<LD>About 40,000 social activists with widely varying causes and
temperaments descended on this South American city Thursday for the
opening of the World Social Forum, a five-day gathering that is part
radical teach-in, part angry political rally.</LD>
<LD>   Intended as a dramatic counterpoint to the meetings of the World
Economic Forum in New York, the event unfolded mostly peacefully, despite
fears of violence that brought a strong police presence to the city's
downtown.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm hoping to get a lot of energy here, to feel that we're not
fighting all by ourselves," said Liesbet Vanmechelen, 31, who helps run
an anti-poverty group in Belgium. She joined a group of colleagues in
unfurling a banner in downtown Porto Alegre that read, in Flemish:
"Struggle Against Injustice."</LD>
<TE>   The activists here see their meeting as the democratic shadow to the
gathering in New York. About 150 countries are represented, and members
of several grass-roots groups trekked across South America by land to get
here.</TE>
<TE>   More than 600 workshops are scheduled, covering topics such as
genetically engineered crops, the rights of indigenous people,
reparations for the descendants of slaves and affordable housing for the
poor.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to embrace so many causes, the official theme of the
event was predictably vague and inoffensive: "Another World Is Possible."</TE>
<TE>   With all hotels here fully booked, organizers housed many delegates in
motels and in a tent city built on the edge of town.</TE>
<TE>   The delegates include environmentalists, trade unionists, peasant
organizers and leftist intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky, whose news
conference Thursday served as an unofficial opening to the event attended
by about 300 journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology linguistics professor and
peace activist spoke of "class warfare" waged by "illegitimate power
concentrations," an oblique reference to the corporate and political
leaders meeting in New York. The scholar was treated like a Hollywood
celebrity by the mostly European and Brazilian press corps here, his
entry greeted with a fusillade of camera flashes.</TE>
<TE>   Chomsky was only one of a parade of radical luminaries due in for the
conference. Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala will chair
a panel Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Inacio da Silva, a leader of Brazil's Workers' Party and the
favorite in this year's race for the country's presidency, held a news
conference Thursday morning. He denounced free trade and hinted that, if
elected in October, he would seek to renegotiate Brazil's foreign debt.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the world would be sensitive so that not one government in
the world allows a child to die from hunger in order to pay debt that
could be negotiated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like Chomsky, he was also sharply critical of the proposed Free Trade
Area of the Americas, or FTAA, that President Bush wants in place by
2005, saying it would amount to "annexation of Latin America by the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Later, about 20,000 activists, more than a few carrying red banners
calling for socialist revolution, marched through the city center under
the watchful eye of hundreds of police. Fearing violence, McDonald's
restaurants posted armed guards.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers denied entry to the forum to a group of activists linked to
Basque separatists and also excluded a representative of the World Bank,
fearing that his presence might stoke the passions of activists and lead
to violence.</TE>
<TE>   But the mood here was mostly festive. As the march wound through
downtown streets, a group of Argentine activists beat pots and pans, a
form of protest that has become emblematic of the anger of their
country's middle class. Argentina has been suffering through recession
and a currency devaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Verediano Pineido, a schoolteacher, came to Porto Alegre from a small
village hundreds of miles away in Brazil's Amazon region, a three-day
journey that included 12 hours on a riverboat. Pineido is a union
organizer in a region known for political assassinations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping to tell people about where I'm from," said Pineido, a man
with sharp, indigenous features. "And I came to see what I could learn
from people in other places."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Acuna rode in a van all night from Buenos Aires, along with other
members of his Argentine group of inner-city squatters.</TE>
<TE>   The squatters' neighborhood was demolished decades ago so that a
highway could be built, Acuna explained. Since then they have taken over
abandoned houses in Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   Acuna had come hoping to find allies for his neighborhood's struggle.
But on the conference's first day, he turned away a bit disappointed.
"There's too many college professors here," he said. "Maybe tomorrow we
will find some people who can help us."</TE>

<HD>U.S., Mexico Investigating Child-Smuggling Operation</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>U.S. and Mexican authorities said Thursday that they were
investigating what one official here called a huge smuggling ring that
transports children to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The ring, operating for several years, had delivered more than 100
children--at least 20 of them from El Salvador--to the U.S., according to
federal law enforcement officials in Mexico. The countries of origin of
the other children were not immediately clear.</LD>
<LD>   Three of those children, authorities said, were found early Tuesday in
the Inland Empire city of Fontana after Mexican officials provided
information to the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</LD>
<TE>   According to U.S. law enforcement officials, two toddlers and a
6-month-old--all cousins--were smuggled across the border to be reunited
with family members who are U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, it is a migrant- smuggling case," INS spokeswoman
Virginia Kice said.</TE>
<TE>   But federal officials in Mexico wouldn't rule out the possibility that
the international ring goes far beyond smuggling and could involve minors
destined for child prostitution or even death as organ donors.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether such crimes are linked to the ring, authorities
in both countries said, the apparent number of children involved--and the
inherent dangers in smuggling them--represents a significant law
enforcement challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The case, said Julio Cardenas, a spokesman for the Federal
Investigative Agency, Mexico's version of the FBI, is "huge."</TE>
<TE>   Three Mexican citizens were in custody and being questioned by the
attorney general's office in connection with child trafficking,
authorities in Mexico City said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three--Estela Barajas Gonzalez, 26, and her aunt Virginia
Barajas Perez, 43--were arrested at Tijuana International Airport on
Monday in the company of six Salvadoran children. They were taken to
Mexico City for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, Mexico's Ministry of Public Security alleged that the
two women were making two or three trips a week to Tijuana, taking three
to six children each time.</TE>
<TE>   The pair aroused the suspicion of airport authorities this week when
they bought return tickets for themselves but not the children.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Barajas has a prior arrest in connection with a 1998 child
theft, and her niece is a suspect in another kidnapping, Mexican
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Abel Bartolo Alaniz, Estela Barajas' husband, was arrested
at a house in Naucalpan, a Mexico City suburb, where five Salvadoran
children were being housed in what Mexican officials described as
"deplorable conditions." At least two of the five children are related, a
spokeswoman for the Mexican attorney general's office said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Mexican authorities, the children said they agreed to go
with the three adults on the promise of being reunited with family.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's spokeswoman said the three suspects were still
being interrogated and that no motive had been determined.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office alleged that the ring's modus operandi
was for Alaniz to take delivery of the youths from a Guatemalan woman
known as the "traveler," who had brought them from Central America. He
would then house them until the two women could arrange to take them to
Tijuana, authorities said, where the children would be handed off to
another person who would smuggle them across the border.</TE>
<TE>   No ages were given for the five children taken into protective custody
in Naucalpan. The six children seized in Tijuana were between 9 and 11
years old. Government officials said they were trying to contact family
members in El Salvador to whom they could return the minors.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, authorities said they had no evidence that the
smuggling ring had a dark purpose, but they weren't ruling out the
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just too many serious allegations being made for us to
discount anything," one senior law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the smuggling of children across the border is a
highly dangerous proposition.</TE>
<TE>   Citing Tuesday's discovery of the three youngsters in Fontana, FBI
spokesman Matthew McLaughlin said, "Although this case seems to have
turned out OK, there are many cases where kids have turned up injured or
killed as a result of smuggling activity."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Asks Judge to Reject Claim Over Detainees</HD>
<DH>Prisoners: Government fights rights coalition's efforts by arguing
that American courts have no authority over suspected terrorists held at
Cuban base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal courts have no authority over suspected Al Qaeda terrorists
being held at the Guantanamo naval base in Cuba, government lawyers
contended in a legal brief filed Thursday in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The government attorneys asked U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz to
dismiss a habeas corpus petition by a coalition of clergy, academics and
civil rights lawyers demanding that the detainees in Guantanamo be
brought before a civilian court in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 160 suspected terrorists captured in Afghanistan are being
housed in open-air cages on the base while the Bush administration
decides whether they should be tried before a military tribunal.</LD>
<TE>   An ad hoc coalition organized by Los Angeles civil rights lawyer
Stephen Yagman contended in a suit filed Jan. 20 that the detainees are
being held in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Geneva
Conventions governing the treatment of war prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   In its response Thursday, the government cited a 1950 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling involving German nationals who were captured in China at the
end of World War II and taken to an American-run prison in occupied
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The court held that the prisoners could not file habeas corpus
petitions in any U.S. courts because they were seized and at all times
held outside the United States' sovereign territory.</TE>
<TE>   The Guantanamo base is not sovereign U.S. territory, the government
said in its brief. Cuba retained sovereignty when it leased the base to
the United States beginning in 1903.</TE>
<TE>   The high court in 1950 also found that allowing "enemy aliens" to file
habeas corpus petitions in U.S. courts could be seen as interfering with
the president's powers as commander in chief.</TE>
<TE>   While arguing that U.S. courts are barred from intervening, the
government on Thursday asked Matz to throw out the petition on narrower
grounds--namely, that Yagman's coalition lacks standing to bring the case
because it has "no significant relationship" with any of the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   The government's brief said that courts are "properly loath" to
unnecessarily address issues related to the president's powers as
commander in chief.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, it said, deciding the case on narrow grounds will affect
only the coalition's rights and not those of the Guantanamo prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the coalition as "uninvited meddlers," the government said
the petitioners have no idea whether the detainees have any desire to
have their cases adjudicated in the United States, "a nation against
which they have waged war."</TE>
<TE>   Any further consideration of the issues should await a case in which
individual detainees have an opportunity to choose their own legal
counsel, the brief argued.</TE>
<TE>   The brief was prepared by the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles in
collaboration with the Justice Department and the solicitor general in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Yagman's coalition has a week to file a written answer to the
government's brief. Matz has set a Feb. 14 date to hear oral arguments.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Food Relief Draws Crowd of Hungry Afghans</HD>
<DH>Aid: Program brings 700 metric tons of wheat to four war-battered
valleys northeast of Kabul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEJRAB, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Down from the snow-covered mountains they came by the hundreds, to
load giant sacks of donated wheat onto their backs or their burros.</LD>
<LD>   The worst off said that for days they hadn't eaten much more than
grasses foraged from the forest and tea brewed from barley or the leaves
of walnut trees.</LD>
<LD>   The better off said they hadn't tasted the long flatbread called naan,
an Afghan staple, in ages, and had been subsisting on maize baked with
grass into coarse, unpleasant loaves.</LD>
<TE>   They came to partake of the first handout from the United Nations
World Food Program in four war-battered valleys northeast of the capital,
Kabul. During the weekend, aid workers began passing out 700 metric tons
of wheat, enough to feed as many as 85,000 people for two months.</TE>
<TE>   Many in Afghanistan are hungry. The worst drought in 30 years has
withered the country's crops, while more than two decades of fighting
have decimated its population.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in my village are weak," said Mohammed Yaqub, 38, who
started walking at 7 a.m. on a recent frigid morning from Dochi Khail,
roughly eight miles away. He arrived at 10:30 at the Nejrab clinic, which
was doubling as a wheat distribution center. "There are no jobs, no
water, no work, no business."</TE>
<TE>   So many people came down from the mountains that Nejrab was overrun by
donkeys and horses bedecked with bright red woven sacks and pink, red,
purple and yellow tassels, all waiting to be loaded down with 220-pound
burlap bags of grain. Each would cost about $85 in the local market.</TE>
<TE>   The villagers are among the 6 million Afghans--about a quarter of the
nation's population--for whom the U.N. is providing food. Wheat for this
distribution came from Pakistan in brightly colored commercial trucks,
and local aid groups were charged with handing it out. Since Sept. 11,
the World Food Program has sent more than 250,000 metric tons of food
into the country, or about 12,500 truckloads.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the agency hasn't been able to reach some of the areas it
thinks are most vulnerable to famine. They are deep in the country's
snowy central mountains. Helicopter airlifts are being considered.</TE>
<TE>   Nejrab is just 50 miles from Kabul, but the roads are so bad that the
trip takes more than three hours in the U.N.'s four-wheel-drive vehicles
and more than a day by truck.</TE>
<TE>   And there are safety problems. One food truck slipped off an icy
bridge, killing the driver. Another hit a land mine, destroying the truck
and the wheat, though the driver survived. Other drivers have been
attacked and robbed of wheat--40 metric tons of it. In one case, the
truck was stolen and the wheat handed out to residents by the thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Still, just 0.2% of the wheat distributed in Afghanistan has been
stolen, said Catherine Bertini, World Food Program executive director,
who passed through Kabul this week.</TE>
<TE>   The people of Afghanistan need other foodstuffs as well. "They need
lentils, sugar and oil, but they're difficult to pack," program spokesman
Jordan Dey said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their hardships, some villagers were cheerful as they waited
to pick up their rations the other day. They chuckled as a donkey, pushed
by Yaqub to go forward to pick up the wheat, inched backward. A crowd
laughed uproariously when a foreign visitor asked if the donkey had a
name. Afghans rarely name their dogs or horses, let alone donkeys.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Razeq, 56, has no land of his own and only occasionally can find
work farming or laboring for others. His village, Wesha, was mostly
destroyed in fighting, and his family members live out of a few rooms
they've managed to fix up in their house.</TE>
<TE>   Razeq walked five hours to get here but left his two donkeys behind
because he wasn't sure he'd be able to get any wheat. But there he was,
struggling to carry the provisions on his back for even a few hundred
yards. He hoped to haul the grain as far as a friend's house a bit
farther up the mountain, and return for it with his animals the next day.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Parwari, the people "haven't yet died [of hunger], but
they're half-dead," said village representative Ghulam Farouk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very good to get [the wheat]; it meets the people's needs," he
said, calling those passing it out "good people, behaving well."</TE>
<TE>   About half the World Food Program's wheat comes from the U.S., but the
grain in this distribution was from Pakistan. Rips in the shabby burlap
bags, perhaps caused by rodents, perhaps by warehouse workers looking to
skim something for themselves, left trails of grain around the village.</TE>
<TE>   The spillage was a bounty for 5-year-old Mohammed Hasrat, who was
picking up grains to "give to the chickens."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Kamir, 40, weary from walking up the mountain with one of the
huge sacks, sat on the roadside catching his breath. Like many other
villagers, he wore no socks inside his simple rubber shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hardship of lugging it home, he was deeply grateful for
the wheat. "Instead of eating bullets as we used to," he said, "we're now
eating bread."</TE>

<HD>For Some, $48-Billion Defense Boost Is a Bust</HD>
<DH>Spending: Many in the Pentagon fear huge increase will be lost on
pay raises, leaving little for replacing hardware.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When Pentagon comptroller Dov Zakheim was finished telling the
financial managers of the armed services that President Bush was seeking
the largest increase in Pentagon spending since 1967, one of them
couldn't resist suggesting it wasn't enough.</LD>
<LD>   "Do you want to see our unfunded list?" he asked, according to a
senior defense official who attended the meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Pentagon financiers are notoriously hard to please. But many are
concerned that the whopping $48-billion increase will be so swallowed up
by pay raises and other measures that the military won't even be able to
replace planes, tanks and other equipment as quickly as it wears out.</LD>
<TE>   Bush said Tuesday in his State of the Union address that the
additional funding would help replace the nation's "aging aircraft" with
the pilotless aircraft and the futuristic gadgetry of the war on
terrorism. But the procurement budget, the portion that funds new
equipment, will get just $8 billion of the $48-billion budget increase,
according to military strategists with knowledge of the budget that
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld plans to outline Monday.</TE>
<TE>   That brings spending on new weapons to $68 billion--far short of the
$103 billion the Pentagon says it needs to replace equipment that wears
out each year, according to a July internal study for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.</TE>
<TE>   Although critics suggest that figure is based on flawed and outdated
assumptions, military strategists contend that, even after the Bush
buildup, future frontiers in the global battle against terrorism are
likely to continue featuring Eisenhower-era B-52s dropping 21st century
"smart" bombs, and helicopters from the 1960s depositing elite soldiers
equipped with lasers and night-vision goggles.</TE>
<TE>   "The Marine Corps is flying a lot of Vietnam-era helicopters. So is
the Army. Neither of those services have asked much in terms of aircraft
modernization. They didn't ask for much because they knew they weren't
going to get it," said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the
Lexington Institute, a conservative think tank based in Arlington, Va.
"Their expectations have been so consistently confounded that now they
only ask for what they need in the short term."</TE>
<TE>   The math goes something like this: The proposed budget would take
Pentagon spending from about $331 billion a year to $379 billion, about a
14% increase. Of that added $48 billion, Bush is asking for $10 billion
to be set aside for a war contingency fund to cover the cost of battling
terrorism in Afghanistan--or Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and other potential
fronts.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves $38 billion. Military analysts estimate that two-thirds of
that will be needed to cover rising costs in "consumption" accounts such
as military pay raises of about 4%, increased health care and housing
benefits, daily operations and maintenance. That would leave about $13
billion for additional investments, of which $8 billion goes to
procurement and the rest for research and development.</TE>
<TE>   The study for the Joint Chiefs found that the Pentagon has been
replacing 282 tanks annually compared with 1,629 needed to replace those
that wear out; 24 helicopters compared with 176 to hold current levels;
42 tactical aircraft compared with 71 needed; and 228 missiles compared
with 419.</TE>
<TE>   Just what it would take to make up the gap is a matter of ongoing
debate. The Congressional Budget Office put the figure at $91 billion.
The private Center for Strategic and International Studies came up with
$123 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience in Afghanistan showed the effectiveness of unmanned
aircraft. But it also revealed how few we have and what their weaknesses
are," Rumsfeld said Thursday at the National Defense University in
Washington. "The department has known for some time that it does not have
enough manned reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft,
command-and-control aircraft, air defense capabilities, chemical and
biological defense units, as well as certain types of special operations
forces."</TE>
<TE>   Put into perspective, the Bush defense buildup for 2003 still would
leave military spending at a lower level than during all major conflicts
from World War II to the early 1990s. In constant 2002 dollars, the
nation spent $561 billion in 1946 after World War II; $461 billion during
the Korean conflict in 1953; $449 billion in 1968 at the peak of the
Vietnam War; and $428 billion in 1987, the peak of President Reagan's
buildup, according to inflation-adjusted figures compiled by the
nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.</TE>
<TE>   Some budget watchers scoff at the suggestion that a 14% increase in
the Pentagon budget is insufficient to replace aging equipment, saying
that claim relies on seriously flawed assumptions. First, they argue, it
doesn't make sense to maintain current levels. Modern warfare no longer
requires the number of tanks used during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Second, they say, those studies assume that new planes and tanks would
be replaced on a 1-to-1 ratio with updated equipment. But one of the
selling points of new planes is that you need fewer of them. Advocates of
the F-22, for example, say each copy can do the work of perhaps two
F-15s, which it is slated to replace.</TE>
<TE>   "If all of the systems are more advanced and more capable, we must
need fewer of them," said Cindy Williams, former assistant director for
national security at the Congressional Budget Office, who now is a
defense analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush continues the defense buildup as expected, he can make up any
existing gap, said Michael Vickers, a defense analyst with the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Vickers expects the Pentagon to
release a five-year plan that brings procurement into that range. "I
think they're well on the way."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts contend that Pentagon strategists unnecessarily inflate
costs by buying new equipment without making hard choices that could save
them money.</TE>
<TE>   "The Joint Chiefs of Staff number sounds like Christmas in July: 'If
we could have everything we wanted,' " said John Isaacs of the Council
for a Livable World. "If they are arguing that they still don't have
enough procurement money, it might mean they do have to make some choices
in the procurement program."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has said his Pentagon will make those hard decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "While transformation [of the military] requires building new
capabilities and expanding our arsenal, it also means reducing stocks of
weapons that are no longer necessary for the defense of our country,"
Rumsfeld said. "Just as we no longer need a massive, heavy force designed
to repel a Soviet tank invasion, we also no longer need many thousands of
offensive nuclear warheads we amassed during the Cold War to deter a
Soviet nuclear attack."</TE>
<TE>   He has portrayed the 2003 budget proposal as a first step toward one
of his top priorities: a departmentwide transformation of the nation's
military machine. The budget plan includes money for precision-guided
bombs, pilotless surveillance and bomber jets, and technology of the type
that special operations soldiers have used in Afghanistan to direct
warplanes to their targets. Future steps would free up money by closing
superfluous military bases and dumping aging planes and ships that drive
up maintenance costs, in favor of more agile, advanced craft.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the Department of Defense runs, the budgeting system, the
planning system, is broken," Rumsfeld said. "It is not serving the
department or the country well. And yet it is inexorable. It just rolls
along, like the freight train coming from San Francisco with the wrong
things for New York."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Reporter's Captors Extend Killing Deadline</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: In e-mail, group says it will put off execution one more
day. Investigators report little progress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>In an e-mail to Pakistani and Western media organizations, the
group claiming to have kidnapped U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl said
Thursday that it will extend its execution deadline 24 hours.</LD>
<LD>   "We will give u 1 more day," said the e-mail, the third such oddly
written communication in four days from the abductors. "If America will
not meet our demands we will kill Daniel. Then this cycle will continue
and no American journalist could enter Pakistan."</LD>
<LD>   Pearl, 38, the Wall Street Journal's South Asia bureau chief,
disappeared Jan. 23 in the teeming southern port city of Karachi. He was
apparently investigating a possible link between a Pakistan-based Islamic
militant group and alleged "shoe bomber" Richard C. Reid.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's e-mail came as a senior Pakistani government official
admitted that the country's law enforcement agencies were still baffled
by the group's identity and its objectives. The group calls itself the
National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, and some
of its e-mails have included photos of Pearl with a gun at his head.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't smack of any group we know," Tasneem Noorani, the No. 2
official in Pakistan's Interior Ministry, said in an interview. "There's
no tradition in this country of internal terrorism or terrorism directed
against foreigners."</TE>
<TE>   "Our problem so far has been sectarian terrorism," Noorani added,
referring to the near-nightly warfare in Karachi between members of
militant Sunni and Shiite Muslim sects.</TE>
<TE>   Although the kidnappers have e-mailed news organizations, they have so
far made no contact with the Pakistani government or shown any interest
in beginning negotiations, Pakistani military and civilian officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Noorani confirmed reports that intense questioning Wednesday of
militant Islamic leader Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani had proved
disappointing. Gilani had been considered an important figure in the case
because he was the person Pearl was trying to contact when he was
abducted.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pakistani military intelligence sources said their
investigation has begun to focus on small terrorist cells within a group
called the Mohajir Quami Movement, also known as the Muttahida Quami
Movement, that draws support from Pakistan's Mohajir minority. The
Mohajir are Muslim families who migrated mainly from the Hindu-dominated
states of central India to Karachi and other southern cities in Pakistan
when the British agreed to partition the subcontinent into a secular
India and the Islamic state of Pakistan in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   The Mohajir, who aspire to their own autonomous area within Pakistan,
include a cluster of small but militant cells, at least one of which is
staunchly anti-American, according to a Pakistani source familiar with
the group.</TE>
<TE>   Two Mohajir Quami Movement members were executed for their role in the
1997 killings of four U.S. oil workers and their Pakistani driver in
Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many questions remain unanswered, those involved in the
investigation said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's kidnapping is atypical for Karachi, a fractious, multiethnic
port city known more for the snatching of business figures and VIPs for
ransom.</TE>
<TE>   As far as authorities know, there was no gun-to-the-temple hustling
off of Pearl, who instead simply disappeared after setting up an
appointment at a hotel restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "Here it seems to be a very smooth, mellow kind of affair, which has
ended up in a kidnapping," Noorani said.</TE>
<TE>   Noorani termed the kidnappers' objectives "shifty." They have demanded
that U.S. military authorities release Pakistani prisoners among the Al
Qaeda suspects being held at Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, and they
have complained about harm done to Afghan citizens during U.S. bombing
runs.</TE>
<TE>   Other aspects of the e-mails, their sophisticated delivery and the
senders' knowledge of U.S. media have led authorities to believe at least
some of the kidnappers are well educated.</TE>
<TE>   "They obviously know about e-mails because they keep changing names
and routing them differently," Noorani said. "They are obviously into
international publicity, and they are getting it. They are not part of
the uncouth, locally educated group of people. One or two of them are
smart."</TE>
<TE>   Noorani hinted at outside responsibility for the kidnapping, including
Pakistan's rival, India.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it seems to be a gambit to malign the image of the emerging
Pakistan as a progressive, secular safe place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a professed lack of knowledge about the group, Noorani played
down the seriousness of the kidnappers' threat to begin killing U.S.
journalists in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wouldn't take that very seriously," he said. But he
cautioned correspondents to be careful about where they travel and what
they investigate. "I think the journalists should stick to the normal
standard location and have good local guides," he said, adding that they
should not be "unnecessarily enterprising."</TE>
<TE>   In an open letter to the kidnappers Thursday, the Wall Street Journal
expressed gratitude for the deadline extension. It also offered a
possible way out of the crisis, saying, "Journalists are, by definition,
trained messengers. Danny can be your messenger.</TE>
<TE>   "A freed Danny can explain your cause, and your beliefs, to the world.
His record as a journalist is proof that he can do this honestly and
effectively. A captive or killed Danny cannot speak for you, cannot help
you or your cause."</TE>

<LD>As three woodcutters hiked in December through the back country of
the former Soviet republic of Georgia, they were drawn to a pair of
objects lying in a pool of melted snow. The men dragged the strangely
warm items back to their camp to help ward off the frosty weather.</LD>
<LD>   At least, that is the story pieced together by the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency, which says the devices are the highly
radioactive remains of a former Soviet communications system.</LD>
<LD>   Now the agency is trying to send a team into the snowy woods to
recover the items, which sickened the men and are thought to contain
strontium-90. Bad weather foiled a recovery attempt last month. The
agency expects to try again Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Experts say strontium-90 cannot set off a nuclear explosion, but
terrorists could attach it to conventional explosives to spread
radioactivity. Smugglers in recent years have attempted to buy
radioactive material from former Soviet installations on the black
market.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some experts say the Soviets placed hundreds of strontium-90
devices throughout their former republics, using them as batteries for
radars or communications relay stations in remote areas. Clay Moltz, a
Russia specialist at the Monterey Institute of International Studies,
said the devices also were used to power coastal lighthouses.</TE>
<TE>Material Is 'Very Dangerous Stuff'</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say there are hundreds, but not hundreds of hundreds," Moltz
said. "It's something of a concern, and it's really irresponsible of the
Russian and post-Soviet nuclear authorities not to have gathered them in.
It's a hazard to the population and could be used by terrorists to spread
panic."</TE>
<TE>   John Holdren, a physicist who leads Harvard University's Program on
Science, Technology and Public Policy, said strontium-90 is "certainly
very dangerous stuff." But he noted that industrial and medical equipment
often contains material that is even more radioactive and also poses
disposal problems.</TE>
<TE>   The woodcutters found the radioactive items on Dec. 2, said Melissa
Fleming, a spokeswoman for the atomic energy agency. "They made the
mistake of bringing them toward their campsite and using them as a type
of heat source," Fleming said, "lying close to them and exposing
themselves to very large doses of radiation."</TE>
<TE>   She said the men became sick a few hours later and went to a hospital.
Doctors there sent them to a hospital in Tbilisi, the nation's capital.
Soon afterward, Georgian officials asked for help from the international
atomic agency, a United Nations organization devoted to safeguarding
nuclear material.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming said the canisters, about 15 centimeters tall and 10
centimeters wide, were left lying exposed in a patch of remote woods
about 400 kilometers northwest of Tbilisi, near the breakaway region of
Abkhazia.</TE>
<TE>   Two agency workers, from Brazil and Britain, are training a local team
to make another attempt to recover the canisters, possibly on Sunday,
Fleming said. Among other things, the team has prepared a lead container
to hold the dangerous material.</TE>
<TE>   News of the agency's work was first reported among Western media
Thursday by the journal Science.</TE>
<TE>Russia May Not Have Adequate Records</TE>
<TE>   The atomic agency believes the canisters contain strontium-90 because
their description is similar to those of other radioactive canisters
found in the region, Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Parrish, a researcher with the Monterey Institute, said Georgian
officials had asked for more cooperation from Russia in locating
radioactive materials from the Soviet era. "I'm not sure the Russians
kept good enough records to tell them everything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parrish said he had seen Russian press reports claiming that the
devices found by the woodcutters had been used to power communications
equipment as part of a series of hydroelectric projects.</TE>
<TE>   According to the reports, he said, the men had broken a concrete shell
around the radioactive material, then melted a protective lead casing to
make bullets for their hunting rifles.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to downplay this too much," Parrish said, "but there
are many cases around the world each year of missing or improper disposal
of radioactive sources like this. Unless there's good evidence that some
terrorist group is after these particular sources, I'm not sure I would
attribute particular importance to any one incident."</TE>
<TE>   Improperly stored radioactive waste has proven to be a health hazard
in many parts of the world.</TE>

<LD>The American Bar Association, meeting in Philadelphia, is debating
whether to support President Bush's plan to try terror suspects by
military tribunals, an approach some lawyers see as an assault on the
criminal justice system.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon is nearly finished writing rules for the first use of
military tribunals since World War II. Although the White House has
announced no specifics, lawyers assume that the panels will begin hearing
cases against suspected Al Qaeda members this year.</LD>

<LD>The Customs Service raided the office of a Seattle-area
money-transfer company that the government believes wired millions of
dollars to Iraq in violation of a decade-old U.S. embargo.</LD>
<LD>   Customs agents seized records from Al-Shafei Family Connect, a
money-wiring business that allows Iraqi immigrants in the United States
to send money to relatives back home, the agency said. The company is
owned and operated by Hussain Al-Shafei, an Iraqi-born U.S. citizen. It
is in Mountlake Terrace, north of Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said the company wired $14.6 million in 344 transfers to
nations around the globe in 1999 and 2000. Officials would not say how
much went to Iraq but estimated that $6.9 million of it was sent to
Jordan.</LD>

<HD>Terrorism Grants Go to States, Cities</HD>
<DH>Policy: The U.S. begins releasing money to help local officials
prepare for attacks. California, L.A. County get $20 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The first installment from the $1.1 billion in bioterrorist
preparedness funds was distributed to states and major cities Thursday,
with nearly $20 million immediately going to California and Los Angeles
County.</LD>
<LD>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, who released
$200 million of the total Thursday, called the federal grants the
"largest one-time investment in the nation's public health system ever."</LD>
<LD>   The plan earmarks about $100 million for California, with $70 million
going to the state and $27.9 million more headed for Los Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   In his proposed state budget for the fiscal year starting July 1, Gov.
Gray Davis counts on the federal government giving the state about $350
million. State Health Services Director Diana Bonta praised the first
payment as "good news."</TE>
<TE>   The allocations, which come 21 days after President Bush signed into
law $2.9 billion in bioterrorism funds, are meant to help Americans from
the largest cities to the least populous states prepare for a potential
bioterrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and a deadly anthrax
attack launched through the mail, many local and state health officials
had raised concerns that decades of inattention to the public health
infrastructure had left them ill-prepared.</TE>
<TE>   Top federal health officials hope the money doled out Thursday will
help close some gaps in the health system, as well as ready the nation
for even more devastating scenarios, such as an attack on a nuclear
facility or the intentional spread of smallpox or other contagious
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The grants to the states, which Thompson indicated he believed would
be supplemented in future budgets, mark an ongoing effort to improve the
public health response. Health officials also have been increasing the
National Pharmaceutical Stockpile with drugs that could be used in the
event of chemical, biological and nuclear attack.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson on Thursday cited the ongoing effort to acquire potassium
iodide, which is used to block the effects of radiation. About 1.6
million doses are in hand, health officials said, and plans are to
purchase another 5 million to 10 million. And he said federal officials
should now be able to deliver 600 tons of emergency medical supplies
within a few hours of an attack anywhere in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   One stumbling block for public health planners had been the ongoing
troubles with Michigan-based BioPort Inc., the nation's only maker of the
anthrax vaccine. The company had been unable to ship doses for four years
because of factory violations, but on Thursday, the Food and Drug
Administration cleared it for renewed production.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is coming together to get us prepared," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the grant plan, the funds released to the states will be used to
bolster preparedness plans, public health surveillance, laboratories and
hospital facilities. About $14 million was made available Thursday to
California, the most populous state, with about $6 million more to come
after Davis files a comprehensive preparedness plan for the state due
April 15.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County, one of four large metropolitan areas to get
separate grants, received about $5.6 million immediately. The other
cities were New York, Chicago and Washington. The nation's capital, which
has about 750,000 residents, was awarded nearly $12 million by officials
concerned that Washington is at heightened risk as the seat of
government.</TE>
<TE>   The money for bioterrorism preparedness comes from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and funding for the regional hospital
response plans is from the Health Resources and Services Administration.
Some smaller cities, including Glendale and Huntington Beach, also are
receiving one-time grants of up to $400,000 to bring them in line with an
existing program designed to ensure 80% of Americans are covered by an
emergency response system.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want money wasted," said Thompson, who said his agency would
be looking for the states to improve the ability of the public health
system to monitor for problems and respond in a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Thompson was announcing the allocation of the federal funds, a
state watchdog commission warned that California's public health sector
is unprepared to respond effectively in this new era of potential
bioterrorism attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In a report, the Little Hoover Commission on economy and efficiency in
government said that the capabilities of California laboratories to
detect biological weapons are "inadequate," that health-care
professionals are not fully trained in dealing with large disasters and
that hospitals are ill-prepared to receive large numbers of bioterror
victims who may be ill with anthrax or smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   The nonpartisan commission said the structure of the public health
system was "perhaps the largest single weakness" to be exposed in the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. After accounting for inflation, local
health departments in California receive less state money now than they
did 50 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   County health department administrators need a one-time transfusion of
at least $70 million, plus $50 million each year in the future to improve
their preparedness, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bonta and state homeland security advisor George Vinson said the
infusion of $97.9 million from the federal government to California,
including $27.9 million for Los Angeles County, would help overcome
concerns raised by the Little Hoover Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Bonta told reporters California wants to create an "optimum" system
for combating biological terrorists. "This money goes a long way to
making that happen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonta said she believed that Los Angeles County was singled out for a
special allocation because it may be a potential "high profile" target,
similar to New York City, which also received a special grant. She said
even before Sept. 11, the county had received about $800,000 in federal
aid for anti-bioterrorist programs.</TE>
<TE>   Bonta said the state would immediately submit its anti-bioterrorism
plan to the federal government and expects to receive the first batch of
funds quickly. California has already implemented many of the federal
requirements for receiving the grants, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the grants would be spent on such processes as managing the
mass storing and distribution of vaccines and antibiotics and beefing up
laboratories with new equipment and enhanced staffs.</TE>

<HD>FDA OKs Anthrax Vaccine Distribution</HD>
<DH>Health: BioPort, which halted production after factory problems, is
set to ship hundreds of thousands of doses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators gave final approval Thursday to resume shipments
of anthrax vaccines, four years after the nation's sole manufacturer
halted production because of factory problems.</LD>
<LD>   The action by the Food and Drug Administration marks an important step
in the government's efforts to prepare for anthrax attacks. Five people
died from the inhaled form of the disease last fall after contaminated
letters were sent through the mail.</LD>
<LD>   The government already has purchased millions of doses of Cipro and
doxycycline, antibiotics that have been shown to prevent and treat
infections caused by the deadly bacteria.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA's action allows BioPort Corp., based in Lansing, Mich., to
immediately ship three lots of the vaccine, each of which contains
hundreds of thousands of doses. At the same time, the company must put
additional warnings on its product, including one about possible birth
defects among women who are vaccinated while pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials said they moved quicker than usual because of the threat
to public health, but they said they did not compromise their standards
for BioPort.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same work, the same standards," said Mark Elengold, a deputy
director in the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "We
hold all manufacturers of licensed biologics products to a high standard.
They will be held to the same standard as everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Elengold acknowledged the public interest in the
issue. "Did we have people working on it longer and harder? Yes," he
said. "People put in a lot of overtime."</TE>
<TE>   Previous violations cited by the FDA included contamination and poor
record-keeping. Some old batches failed sterility tests.</TE>
<TE>   While the FDA's action settles regulatory concerns about BioPort,
there's still a heated debate about the safety of the vaccine, which some
critics say can have deadly side effects. A lawsuit filed in October on
behalf of one dead and one injured soldier claims that BioPort failed to
sufficiently test the efficacy and safety of the vaccine used to immunize
U.S. military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   BioPort officials said they are pleased with the FDA approval and hope
that it reaffirms the vaccine's safety and efficacy. The company has been
working to meet federal requirements since purchasing the facility from
the state of Michigan in September 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will bring a complete end to the naysayers, but
nothing speaks to the naysayers like success," said Bob Kramer, president
and chief operating officer of BioPort. "All of the hard work that we've
endured over the last three years has paid off."</TE>
<TE>   Most scientists say the anthrax vaccine is safe for adults, causing
only minor side effects such as a lump, soreness and redness at the
injection site that can last for days. Some people also experience fever
and joint pain, although those symptoms occur less commonly.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has required that BioPort more clearly explain those side
effects on warning labels.</TE>
<TE>   Because of BioPort's problems, the Pentagon was forced to scale back
plans to vaccinate all 2.4 million active and reserve troops. While it
reviews Thursday's approval, the Pentagon said it will continue to
vaccinate only special mission units. A decision about future vaccination
plans will be made soon.</TE>
<TE>   To achieve full immunity, a person must get six doses over 18 months,
plus annual booster shots.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the Department of Health and Human Services struck a deal
to buy about 10,000 doses of the vaccine from the Defense Department for
people exposed to the deadly anthrax spores along the East Coast. Some
experts were concerned that some people may still have bacteria lingering
in their lungs that could make them sick even after completing antibiotic
regimens.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta did
not recommend that people take the vaccine, but rather, called it an
experimental treatment and allowed high-risk people to decide for
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 10,000 people characterized as high risk, only 190 had received
the first dose of the vaccine as of last week, CDC spokeswoman Cynthia
Glocker said. Those people also were offered an additional 40 days of
antibiotics, on top of the 60-day supply they initially received.</TE>
<TE>   BioPort's Kramer said the company hopes to produce enough vaccine to
inoculate police officers, firefighters, investigators and lab
technicians--the people who are among the first to respond to
emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   The company also hopes to stockpile enough vaccine for civilians in
the event of a large-scale anthrax attack. Currently, the vaccine is not
recommended for and is not available to the general public.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers' Pet Projects Targets of Bush's Cuts</HD>
<DH>Budget: The president's proposal for making up a shortfall in the
Pell grant program isn't popular on Capitol Hill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>To make up an estimated $1.3-billion shortage for a popular college
tuition grant program, the Bush administration is proposing to cut
funding for hundreds of local education and community projects that
lawmakers singled out for federal aid late last year.</LD>
<LD>   Among the potential targets: $1 million for a literacy technology
center in the Pomona Unified School District, $800,000 for educational
programs and exhibits at the Children's Museum of Los Angeles and $50,000
for a performing arts literacy program at the East Los Angeles Classic
Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, part of the federal budget Bush is releasing Monday,
underscores the fiscal pressures in Washington as the government plunges
back into budget deficits and the war on terrorism drives up defense and
security spending.</LD>
<TE>   It also marks an escalation of the president's campaign against what
he and other critics call pork-barrel spending--an ingrained part of
doing business in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said Thursday that cutting these pet projects
of particular lawmakers is a legitimate way to find money for Pell
grants, which provide up to $4,000 a year in tuition assistance for
low-income college students.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately dismissed
the proposal as a stunt.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we're going to do this," said John Scofield, spokesman
for the Republican majority on the House Appropriations Committee. Jim
Dyer, the committee director, called the proposal "beyond the pale" and
"an attempt to embarrass our committee."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, a senior Democrat on the House
Appropriations subcommittee that funds labor, health and education
programs, said: "President Bush is trying to rob Peter to pay Paul, and
that simply isn't going to work."</TE>
<TE>   No one argues that the Pell grant program is short of funds. The
reason is twofold: applications for financial aid are growing, and so are
the maximum awards.</TE>
<TE>   About 4.44 million students are expected to qualify for aid in the
2002-03 school year, Education Department officials estimate. That's up
from 4.28 million in 2001-02 and 3.91 million the year before. At the
same time, Congress has raised the maximum award to $4,000, up from
$3,750 in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   With federal revenue failing to meet expenses as a result of the
recession, tax cuts and spending demands, the Education Department will
not have enough money in the current fiscal year to pay eligible students
as much as Congress says they are entitled. "In essence, Congress has
written a check for $11.6 billion but deposited only $10.3 billion in the
bank to cover it," an administration budget document says.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials expect to ask Congress to direct more money
to the tuition grants in a special fiscal 2002 appropriations bill. But
they are asking for something in return that few lawmakers seem willing
to give: cuts in the so-called "earmarked" programs. In a proposal
circulating Thursday, the administration was asking Congress to examine
$2.2 billion in already enacted spending items--including about $1
billion worth of earmarks--to meet the shortage.</TE>
<TE>   "The overarching problem is when you have a finite amount of resources
to deal with lots of important issues," said Trent Duffy, a spokesman for
White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage in tuition grant funding, Duffy said, is an "example of
what happens when funds are diverted for other purposes."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,600 local projects and programs were inserted last year
into the spending bill for labor, health and education. The list includes
items from Republican and Democratic lawmakers from all parts of the
country, including a significant number from California.</TE>
<TE>   The Pomona Unified literacy program was championed by Rep. David
Dreier (R-San Dimas), chairman of the House Rules Committee. He was
unavailable for comment late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Children's Museum funding was spearheaded by Rep. Howard L. Berman
(D-Mission Hills). His spokeswoman, Gene Smith, said that while the
project may be a low priority for Bush, it is "a very high priority for
us." Smith said the funding would help educate "a very broad array of
children, many of them extremely underprivileged."</TE>
<TE>   And the East Los Angeles literacy project was backed by Rep. Lucille
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles). She said in a statement that Congress
should set aside more money for Pell grants. "However, the money does not
have to come from important programs already approved by the House and
Senate and signed into law by the president," Roybal-Allard said.</TE>
<TE>   She suggested another solution: delaying some of the tax cuts for the
wealthy that Bush pushed into law last year as part of a 10-year,
$1.35-trillion package of cuts.</TE>

<HD>Plans Moving Ahead for Redeveloping Trade Center Site</HD>
<DH>Architecture: Proposal would combine some large-scale commercial
endeavors with a variety of public components.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES ARCHITECTURE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The developer who holds the lease to the World Trade Center
property is completing the first comprehensive master plan for the
16-acre site that sources say would consist of a number of office
buildings clustered around a single soaring tower, a memorial park and
two cultural venues.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by David Childs of Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill, one of New York
City's most established firms, the plan will be presented by developer
Larry Silverstein to the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.--the state
agency charged with overseeing reconstruction of the site--possibly in
the next few weeks. Meanwhile, the team has approached the New York City
Opera and the Guggenheim Museum about occupying new arts venues that
would be created as part of the development.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal promises to fuel an already contentious debate about what
should be built at the site. At issue is the fast pace at which the
development plans have proceeded, which has offended some victims'
families, who consider the site a mass grave. Of equal importance is how
to balance the economic interests of the real estate community with the
desire to create a public memorial.</LD>
<TE>Site Was 'a Very Forbidding Place'</TE>
<TE>   Childs' plan seeks to address at least some of those concerns by
combining a large-scale commercial office development with a variety of
public components.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Trade Center was a very forbidding place. It was isolated
from the city," Childs said in an interview. "This is an opportunity to
reknit the project into the city, to reactivate the great public spaces
of the street. It should feel open to everyone, from the homeless to the
wealthy CEO of a giant company. And I think that is a tremendously
important quality to whatever happens here." He declined to go into
detail about the design.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the plan still faces significant hurdles. Silverstein has
yet to receive insurance money for the destruction of the twin towers
Sept. 11, which could range from $3.6 billion to $7.2 billion. And he is
certain to encounter stiff resistance from groups representing the
victims' families, who feel the first task should be to determine how
best to memorialize those who died in the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still a burial site," said Monika Iken, founder of
September's Mission, a group that represents families of the victims. "We
really have to think about the qualities the site will possess, and how
it can also comfort those of us who are in pain. And rebuilding is not
sending the right message right now."</TE>
<TE>   Iken, whose husband died in the attacks, cited a farewell speech by
Rudolph W. Giuliani in which the former mayor stated that the site should
not be regarded as a place for economic development, but as the home for
a "soaring, monumental beautiful memorial."</TE>
<TE>   But Childs argues that the project presents a "great opportunity" for
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have wanted all of the acreage to be a memorial," he
said. "They do it with the conviction that comes with having such an
emotional relationship to it. I know, in history, I have admired the
cultures who have gone on to rebuild. Look at Berlin after [World War II]
or the Blitz in London. If all of those areas had been set aside for
memorials, it would have harmed the fabric of those cities."</TE>
<TE>Design Includes Range of Architectural Voices</TE>
<TE>   The design by Childs, whose 55-story AOL Time Warner Center at
Columbus Circle is under construction, also tackles broader urban
planning issues in downtown New York. During the late 1960s and early
'70s, the construction of the World Trade Center and its massive elevated
plaza obliterated much of the area's street grid. For example, Greenwich
and Washington streets, once major pedestrian thoroughfares, now dead-end
onto the site. Childs' master plan seeks to reestablish that street grid,
reconnecting the downtown core to Battery Park City to the west.</TE>
<TE>   As for the architecture of the buildings, Childs envisions a
development with components broad and varied enough to accommodate a
range of architectural voices. "I think that at this scale, a project
that uses multiple designers will be a richer place than if it was all
being done by one hand."</TE>
<TE>   Silverstein has been actively seeking potential occupants for the
plan's cultural components. The 70-year-old developer, a self-professed
music lover, approached the New York City Opera about moving downtown
soon after the opera announced its plans to leave Lincoln Center, where
it has been since 1966.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that he has discussed the move with Silverstein,
Paul Kellogg, the opera's artistic director, said he has made no definite
plans to move downtown. "First we have to make sure our audience would
follow us," Kellogg said. "But I think some kind of cultural center there
would be a wonderful thing for New York."</TE>
<TE>   Silverstein has also met twice with Guggenheim Museum director Thom
Krens, whose plan to build a $678-million museum complex, designed by Los
Angeles architect Frank Gehry, on a pier at the edge of the East River at
Wall Street, is in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   Guggenheim officials have refused to comment about the talks with
Silverstein, but Krens has asked Gehry whether he would consider
designing such a venue.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever rises here," Childs said, "it will one day come to express
how people will understand our culture 100 years from now."</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden Vague About 9/11 Role in Video</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>CNN aired excerpts of an October interview with Osama bin Laden on
Thursday in which he makes ambiguous statements about responsibility for
the Sept. 11 terror attacks and dodges a question about whether he was
behind anthrax-laced letters sent to U.S. targets.</LD>
<LD>   The cable network's use of the video prompted a rift between CNN and
Al Jazeera, the pan-Arab satellite network with which CNN has had a
video-sharing agreement. CNN read a statement from Al Jazeera saying the
Arab network was severing its affiliation with CNN for airing the tape,
claiming it was obtained illegally.</LD>
<LD>   CNN said it legally acquired the video from a nongovernment source and
didn't pay for it. The TV interview is the only one known to have been
conducted with Bin Laden after the terror attacks. It has never aired
publicly, though government officials have been aware of it for months.</LD>
<TE>   Eason Jordan, CNN's chief news executive, said Al Jazeera denied that
such a tape existed when CNN learned of it in late November. Later, Al
Jazeera told CNN the tape wasn't newsworthy, but Jordan said the tape
contained "extremely provocative" material and CNN was "explicitly
entitled to all Al Jazeera material, televised or not" under their
agreement, which provides reciprocal access to each other's footage.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera's statement said the network "does not feel it's obligated
to explain its position and its reasoning of why it chose not to air the
interview," adding that it expected CNN to "respect its special
relationship with Al-Jazeera by not airing material that Al-Jazeera
itself chose not to broadcast."</TE>
<TE>   The interview was conducted Oct. 20. In another twist, CNN said it was
told by Al Jazeera that the network was offered the meeting after sending
written questions to Bin Laden, including six questions submitted on
behalf of CNN.</TE>
<TE>   In one excerpt, Bin Laden ridicules White House requests that U.S. TV
networks refrain from airing statements from him. "They said that Osama's
messages have codes in them to the terrorists," Bin Laden says. "It's as
if we were living in the time of mail by carrier pigeon, when there are
no phones, no travelers, no Internet, no regular mail, no express mail
and no electronic mail."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding his involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, Bin Laden first
says America's "charge that we are carrying out acts of terrorism is
unwarranted." But later he says, "If killing those who kill our sons is
terrorism, then let history be witness that we are terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he was behind the anthrax scare, Bin Laden says, "These
diseases are a punishment from God and a response to oppressed mothers'
prayers in Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine and everywhere."</TE>

<DL>GARDIZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Terrified families huddled in basements and fled on foot Thursday
as rival Afghan warlords waged artillery battles for control of this
strategic town, killing at least 43 people and injuring dozens of others.</LD>
<LD>   The fighting gave new urgency to interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai's
appeal for an expanded international security force to be deployed
outside the capital, Kabul, to stave off such factional battles.</LD>
<LD>   Laying siege to Gardiz, the capital of Paktia province, was Bacha
Khan, a local warlord aligned with Karzai's administration, which named
him governor of the province. Local tribal elders refused to accept
Khan's appointment, so Khan moved to take the city by force.</LD>
<TE>   The fighting could complicate American efforts--including clandestine
operations led by small bands of U.S. Special Forces troops--to root out
fugitive Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the southeastern province.
Paktia, which borders Pakistan, includes numerous smuggling routes that
Taliban and Al Qaeda fugitives could use to escape Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Loud explosions, the dull thud of mortars and the rattle of heavy
machine-gun fire echoed through the deserted streets of Gardiz on
Thursday as Khan's troops, dug in atop a pair of hills south of the city,
took aim at fighters loyal to the town's tribal council, holed up in a
fortress in the town center.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. warplanes circled overhead during Thursday's fighting but did not
intervene, and a contingent of what local leaders said were U.S. Special
Forces troops stayed out of sight at their base south of town.</TE>
<TE>   Khan has been aiding the U.S. troops.</TE>

<TE>Beginning in stories published in 2006, the Afghan warlord Bacha Khan is
identified as Pacha Khan Zadran. (Second reference is "Pacha Khan.")</TE>

<LD>Prime Minister Tony Blair told interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai
on Thursday that Britain could not commit more troops to an expanded
international force requested by Afghanistan's people.</LD>
<LD>   Britain is leading the force, which is deployed in Kabul, the Afghan

of April.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai, in Britain for one day, told a meeting of Blair's Cabinet,
"The Afghan people keep asking for more and more security forces in
Afghanistan."</LD>
<TE>   At the United Nations on Wednesday, Karzai asked the Security Council

<HD>Proposal Calls Fetus a 'Child' for Health Care</HD>
<DH>Funding: Bush says rule change would let states offer prenatal
services to poor. Abortion rights groups criticize move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration said Thursday it will define human embryos
as children so that states can offer expanded prenatal health-care
services to poor women, but women's advocates sharply criticized the move
as a poorly disguised effort to weaken abortion rights.</LD>
<LD>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson proposed a
regulatory change to the federal-state program that provides health
insurance coverage for children from low-income families. By redefining
eligible participants as "children from conception to age 19," he said,
the new regulation would allow states to cover low-income pregnant women
under the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration first floated the idea of changing the
definition last summer and received a strong negative response from
abortion rights advocates. Bush officials said Thursday they did not
understand the criticism.</LD>
<TE>   "What we are going to do is provide for low-income women to have
prenatal care," Thompson said. "How anybody can try and turn this into a
pro-choice, pro-abortion argument, I don't understand."</TE>
<TE>   Abortion rights advocates said they support quality prenatal care for
all women, but accused the administration of playing politics with the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems much more designed to achieve a political goal than a health
goal," Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, said
of the proposed regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), an author of the original CHIP
legislation, said a definition of child that begins at conception "seeks
to pander to the extreme views of anti-abortion constituents who believe
that termination of a pregnancy for any reason is murder."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's announcement, made in a news release, focused immediate
attention on a central, highly charged sticking point of the abortion
debate:</TE>
<TE>   For 30 years, abortion rights advocates have emphasized the rights of
women to make their own health-care choices. For just as long, abortion
opponents have focused on the rights of unborn children to be protected
from harm. And in abortion law, the rights of the woman and her unborn
child are in direct conflict.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the fetus has been gaining legal rights. Two dozen
states, including California, have laws that treat fetuses as separate
from the mother as victims of crime. And in April, the House passed the
Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which recognized as a separate victim a
fetus harmed during the commission of a federal crime.</TE>
<TE>   Abortion rights advocates worry that a federal court might someday
rule that the legal rights of a fetus trump a pregnant woman's rights.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole effort throughout the country to ascribe rights to the
fetus, separate and apart from the woman, is an attempt to create a legal
patchwork, and over time to roll back Roe vs. Wade," said Kate Michelman,
president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposal to cover embryos is another demonstration of the Bush
administration's commitment to have the government make abortion
illegal," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life
Committee, praised the administration's proposal, and said "only the most
extreme pro-abortion ideologues" could oppose it. The new definition
"will have no legal bearing" on abortion law, Johnson said, as Roe vs.
Wade--the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing a woman's right to
abortion--is based on a woman's right to privacy.</TE>
<TE>   The practical effect of the proposed regulation, which will be
published in the Federal Register and subjected to a formal comment
period, was unclear Thursday. The regulation would allow states to
provide prenatal care to eligible women, but would not require them to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman said many states already provide prenatal care through Medicaid
for pregnant women earning as much as 185% of the federal poverty
level--about $15,890 for a single person.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, when state officials want to change a federal-state program
in some way, they apply to the federal government for a waiver. In the
case of CHIP, Rhode Island and New Jersey applied for and received
waivers to expand their services to pregnant women.</TE>
<TE>   And last week, the Bush administration granted a waiver to Medi-Cal
and California's version of CHIP, Healthy Families, so that the state
could offer health insurance to about 300,000 working poor parents as
well as to their children.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Waxman and abortion rights advocates said Thursday, the Bush
administration could have used the normal waiver process to allow CHIP
programs to cover prenatal and delivery care for low-income women.
Instead, they charged, by proposing a regulation that redefines "child,"
the administration is revealing its anti-abortion agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The change is "so clearly unnecessary," said NOW's Gandy, "that it
seems fairly transparent to me that this is an effort to undermine
women's reproductive choices."</TE>
<TE>   The administration and its supporters said regulatory change was the
best way to expand CHIP coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just easier," HHS spokesman Campbell Gardett said. "There is
a large pool of money sitting idle, and it could be put to use fairly
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Congress in 1997 set aside $40 billion in federal CHIP funding over 10
years. The federal government covers about 70% of all CHIP funding by the
states. Thompson said that President Bush's proposed budget for 2003
would give states access to $3.2 billion in unused CHIP funds.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's action was not the first time that controversial language
about the "unborn child" was a part of federal social welfare policy,
Gardett said. Until the 1970s, the program specifically noted the
eligibility of unborn children, as did Medicaid regulations until 1981.
The language was removed, Gardett said, because of conservatives'
concerns that poor women were having children just to get welfare or
Medicaid.</TE>

<HD>Latest Reno Fainting Spell Rekindles Election Doubts</HD>
<DH>Politics: The ex-attorney general's chances to oust Jeb Bush as
Florida governor are hurt, some say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>When former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno fainted on an auditorium stage in
upstate New York, her hopes to become Florida's next governor may have
been seriously damaged.</LD>
<LD>   For the 63-year-old Democrat, her public malaise Wednesday evening may
prove to be the defining, dooming campaign moment, like former Secretary
of State Edmund Muskie's apparent weeping during the 1972 presidential
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been watching television this morning and seeing the videotape,
and all the reports are mentioning her Parkinson's, her health and her
age," said Susan MacManus, professor of political science at the
University of South Florida in Tampa.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm sure she is going to be pressured to reconsider her candidacy by
some top Democrats," MacManus added.</TE>
<TE>   Flying home to Miami on Thursday afternoon, Reno was met by a phalanx
of newspaper and television reporters at this city's airport. She
declared herself still "gung-ho" about running for governor and said
voters should be no more worried about her health than they were for
President Bush when he choked on a pretzel Jan. 13 and lost
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   But Reno, a former state attorney for Miami-Dade County, did leave
herself an opening for a withdrawal from the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I always keep all of my options open," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The electoral battle to become the Sunshine State's next chief
executive is widely considered to be the marquee event on the 2002
political calendar, in large part because the Republican incumbent
seeking reelection is Jeb Bush, the president's brother.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, after appearing at a fund-raiser and fielding
questions at a news conference, Reno was supposed to deliver a speech at
the University of Rochester. She had been talking for about 45 minutes on
the rewards and challenges of public service when she lost consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Reno told the audience: "You're going to have to excuse me for a
minute. I'm going to have to sit down." She crumpled to the floor behind
the lectern, with a video camera capturing the sequence on tape.</TE>
<TE>   A "very hot light" had been shining on her, Reno told reporters after
flying back to Miami. She got "sweaty and hot," then made what she
jokingly called "a graceful or not graceful--I'm not quite sure--exit."</TE>
<TE>   Reno was rushed to a hospital, where she remained until being
discharged Thursday morning. In a statement, a hospital physician, Dr.
John Franklin Richeson, said Reno had "suffered a simple fainting spell,
which we believe was the result of a busy travel day," not eating much
during the day and "unusually warm conditions" in the auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   She was unconscious for less than a minute and "suffered no injury as
a result," Richeson said. He said blood, heart and brain-scan test
results all appeared normal, and that aside from the Parkinson's disease
she has had for the last seven years, Reno appeared "in excellent
health."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel great," said Reno after towing her own carry-on bag up to
journalists waiting for her at Miami International Airport. In the coming
months, she said, she will drive the length of Florida's peninsula in her
pickup truck to listen to people and speak to them on issues she deems
vital: schools, saving the Everglades, controlling growth.</TE>
<TE>   As she talked to the press, her hands trembled violently at times.
Reno, who was diagnosed with the progressive neurological disorder of
Parkinson's disease in November 1995, has said her physicians have
assured her that her condition would not impair her ability to run for
office or serve a four-year governor's term.</TE>
<TE>   However, many Florida Democrats are known to be worried that Reno, a
polarizing figure because of her service in the Clinton administration,
might drag a lot of other Democratic candidates for other seats to defeat
if she wins their party's Sept. 10 gubernatorial primary. Reno had
already fainted at least twice before in public, in November 1997 and
September 1998, and new questions about her health cannot help her.</TE>
<TE>   "The question the party is going to have to confront is: If she goes
down, does she take everything else down with her?" said Roger Handberg,
interim chair of the political science department at the University of
Central Florida in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Another Democrat running in the gubernatorial primary, state Rep. Lois
Frankel of West Palm Beach, said Reno must meet questions about her
health head-on to allay voters' concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "She's going to have to answer the questions that anybody who's
running for public office, anybody that's fainted or collapsed, would
have to answer," Frankel said. "What caused it? Is it life-threatening in
any way, and is it going to happen again?"</TE>
<TE>   Amid fellow Democrats' jitters about Reno's electability, the campaign
of another of the five Democrats who wants to be governor, Tampa lawyer
Bill McBride, 56, has been picking up steam. He has actually outpaced the
much better-known Reno in fund-raising and picked up a key endorsement in
January, from the state teachers union, the Florida Education Assn.</TE>
<TE>   State leaders of the AFL-CIO, a labor constituency that Reno should
have been able to count on, have also made it no secret that they favor
McBride, though they have yet to make a formal endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for Florida Democrats to ponder their strategy is an
opinion poll printed in some of the state's newspapers in the same
Thursday morning editions that contained stories of Reno's bout of
fainting. The survey, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research, found
Bush's popularity to be on the increase.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the Republican first-term governor enjoys a 58% favorable
rating, up from 52% in July, the poll found. His unfavorable rating
declined over the same period from 46% to 41%. Some analysts theorized
Bush was basking in the overwhelming approval given his brother in the
White House for his handling of the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In public remarks, Florida's governor was careful Thursday not to cast
aspersions on Reno's health, reminding people of his brother's recent
encounter with the pretzel. He said he had sent her a note of goodwill
and expressed hopes for a "speedy recovery."</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine she had a long day. She was tired and collapsed," said
Bush, who also visited Miami Thursday. "Let me think of other people that
have had that happen recently: the president of the United States who
can, I guarantee you, outrun anybody in [a] four-mile run."</TE>

<LD>The Archdiocese of Boston, which has given prosecutors the names of
at least 30 former priests accused of sexually abusing children, is being
asked to also supply the names of alleged victims.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese said it would contact such individuals and give
investigators the names of those who want to come forward. Information
the church has on alleged incidents dating back to the 1960s could help
build criminal cases against the accused, a prosecutor said. The
archdiocese has faced scrutiny since it became publicly known that a
defrocked priest convicted last month of sex crimes on a child had been
assigned to a parish after being removed from two other parishes
following accusations of molesting children.</LD>

<HD>Future of Arsenic-Dosed Wood Hinges on Talks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talks underway between federal regulators and lumber industry
officials could result in wood decks, playground equipment and picnic
tables treated with a preservative containing arsenic being taken off the
market soon.</LD>
<LD>   The discussions focus on chromated copper arsenate, or CCA, a
pesticide used to protect lumber from decay and insect damage.</LD>
<LD>   The Environmental Protection Agency implemented a rule last fall
requiring labeling of all pieces of CCA-treated wood, also commonly found
in railings, fences, posts and docks. Switzerland, Vietnam and Indonesia
have banned CCA-treated wood. Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Australia
and New Zealand have limited its use or proposed restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   The EPA has been preparing a comprehensive review of CCA-treated wood
that could lead to more regulatory changes. That review will include an
evaluation of how well the new consumer information programs are working.</TE>

<HD>Historian Ambrose Explains Attribution Errors in Books</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>Historian Stephen Ambrose said Thursday night that he made mistakes
in not using quotation marks around sentences that came from other books
but said his footnotes adequately attribute the sentences.</LD>
<LD>   At least six books by Ambrose have been questioned for errors or
alleged plagiarism.</LD>
<LD>   The author made the comments before a speech Thursday night in Powell
Symphony Hall before a capacity crowd of 2,100. The speech was sponsored
by Maryville University.</LD>
<TE>   "There are something like six or seven sentences in like three or four
of my books that are sentences from other writers," Ambrose said. "I know
they are, and reporters know they are, and now the whole world knows they
are because I put footnotes behind those sentences. What I failed to
do--and this was my mistake--was put quotation marks around them."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Ambrose's peers consider the footnotes inadequate. Ambrose
also has blamed his quick pace for the errors.</TE>

<KH>THE FALL OF ENRON</KH>
<HD>Ex-Enron CEO Agrees to Testify Before Panel</HD>
<DH>Energy: Appearance by Skilling called critical by chairman of
subcommittee looking into firm's downfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Jeffrey K. Skilling, who unexpectedly quit as Enron Corp. chief
executive in August, has agreed to testify next week before Congress, a
Senate subcommittee chairman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Congressional investigators are eager to hear from Skilling, who has
denied any wrongdoing in the events leading to the energy company's
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Dec. 2.</LD>
<LD>   But another Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, wrote to Enron
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August that Skilling had been warned about the
company's problems by other executives, including former Vice Chairman J.
Clifford Baxter, who died last week in an apparent suicide.</LD>
<TE>   "Skilling is critical," said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), who chairs
the Senate Commerce Committee's subcommittee on consumer affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also has asked for the testimony of fired Enron Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who allegedly set up many of the
off-the-books partnerships that were instrumental in the company's
collapse. Fastow has not responded to the committee, Dorgan said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Skilling confirmed that he had agreed to testify
voluntarily and would do so without a grant of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to be open and forthcoming with all committees investigating
this matter," Judy Leon said.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly when and where Skilling will testify next week is unclear. He
is listed as a witness at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing
Thursday. Dorgan's committee and others among the dozen congressional
panels investigating the Enron collapse also are seeking his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "There are competing invitations, and that is complicating the
scheduling," Leon said.</TE>
<TE>   Lay, who replaced Skilling as chief executive and was ousted from that
position last week, is scheduled to testify before Dorgan's committee
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Dorgan said both men are likely to say Enron's collapse was due to
circumstances beyond their control, but that his panel was prepared to
counter such claims with internal documents showing that Enron's board of
directors knew about the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed on
various occasions the creation of partnerships, the structure of the
business deals," Dorgan said.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) called on House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to be the "gatekeeper" in determining
whether immunity is granted to witnesses in the Enron investigation and
what documents are made public.</TE>
<TE>   Complaining about leaks of documents that damaged other cases, Miller
wrote Hastert: "The failure to honor confidentiality, the untimely
release of information or the inappropriate granting of immunity all have
great potential to compromise and undermine [potential] criminal
prosecutions of Enron and [accounting firm] Arthur Andersen."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) called on the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to provide her with a list of all meetings and phone calls
that took place between Enron executives and FERC commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day more and more alarming information is revealed concerning
Enron's role in prolonging the California electricity crisis," she said
in a letter to FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC said this week that it would investigate allegations that
Enron used its market clout to artificially inflate long-term electricity
prices on the West Coast. On Thursday, at a FERC-sponsored conference in
New York on power supplies in the Northeast, Wood told Reuters news
service that its inquiry had begun.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Wood on Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis urged FERC to
expedite the inquiry and expand it to include other energy marketers.</TE>
<TE>   "California has a special interest in getting to the bottom of such
charges, since this state bore the brunt of the marketers' price
gouging," Davis wrote.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Unveil His Proposal for Pension Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Seeking to inoculate himself and other Republicans against
political fallout from the Enron Corp. debacle, President Bush will soon
ask Congress to broadly revamp pension laws, including enhancing the
ability of workers to diversify their retirement accounts heavy with
company stock, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The president will unveil his proposal today at a congressional
Republican retreat in West Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   Many key elements of Bush's proposal, which was previewed for
reporters Thursday by administration officials, seem designed to address
problems arising out of the collapse of Enron, the Houston-based energy
trading company that filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, leaving many of its
workers holding near-worthless retirement accounts.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, Bush will propose "pension parity," which would bar
senior executives from selling company stock if rank-and-file employees
may not trade such stock in their 401(k) plans, tax-deferred retirement
savings programs. Such "blackout" periods often are imposed when
employers change pension plan features or administrators.</TE>
<TE>   As Enron stock collapsed last autumn, employees were prohibited from
selling their shares held in the 401(k) plan because it was changing
administrators. Top executives, however, were able to sell off shares of
common stock they had received as part of their compensation packages.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's proposal also would require companies to give 30 days' notice
before any "blackout" period begins and make them more liable during such
periods.</TE>
<TE>   Current law exempts employers from liability in workers' investment
choices when 401(k) plans are controlled by workers. That "safe harbor"
provision would no longer apply during a blackout period. Under Bush's
plan, employers would be responsible for what happens to workers'
investments if the company fails to act in the interest of the workers
when it creates the blackout period.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the president's plan also would allow workers to sell
company stock after three years--including those shares contributed by
companies as matching grants--and pursue other investment options, while
companies would be encouraged to make independent financial advice
available to employees.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, many companies provide no 401(k) investment options besides
company stock.</TE>
<TE>   "About 42 million American workers own 401(k) accounts with a total of
$2 trillion in assets," according to a background paper prepared by the
administration. "These workers need to have full confidence in the
security of their pension plans."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's plan would require companies to give workers quarterly benefit
statements with information about their accounts, including the value of
their assets, their rights to diversify and the importance of maintaining
a diverse portfolio. Under current law, such reports are due annually.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's proposals came from a Cabinet-level task force
that Bush formed three weeks ago. Members included Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and Commerce Secretary Don
Evans.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has argued that the Enron debacle raised questions of "corporate
governance," insisting that it is not a political issue. But with a dozen
congressional committees looking into Enron's business practices--and a
Justice Department criminal investigation underway--the controversy is
likely to remain in the news for months to come and may dog Republicans
in the off-year elections this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has been on the defensive in the Enron matter because the company
has been his chief financial angel, having given an estimated $700,000 to
his gubernatorial and presidential campaigns through its political action
committee, employees and directors--far more than any other single U.S.
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Since Enron's collapse, the White House has disclosed that the
now-ousted Enron chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, a friend of the president's,
called Evans and O'Neill, but both Cabinet secretaries said they refused
to help Lay or Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Such disclosures raised questions about whether Enron received special
treatment because of its deep ties to the Bush administration.</TE>

<HD>Winter's Deadly Grip Paralyzes U.S. Midsection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A crippling winter storm rolled out of the nation's midsection and
into the Northeast on Thursday, knocking out power in hundreds of
thousands of homes in a swath that stretched from Oklahoma City to
Toledo, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   The belt of ice and snow at one point wreaked havoc from the Texas
Panhandle to upstate New York, and nearly all points between. At least 15
deaths were blamed on slick roads or freezing temperatures.</LD>
<LD>   At airports around the Midwest, passengers were stranded by the
thousands. More than a foot of snow fell at O'Hare International Airport
in Chicago, causing cancellations, delays and headaches.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of schools were closed Thursday in Oklahoma, Michigan,
Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma and Missouri were hit the hardest, with an icy rain
lacquering everything in sight. Utility officials in Kansas said it was
the worst storm in memory and warned it could be days before power is
fully restored.</TE>
<TE>   In the flat ranchland near Anadarko, Okla., cattle roamed free after
heavy ice took down fences. In Perry, 100 miles away, decades-old elm and
pecan trees littered city streets and county roads.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like a bomb went off in town," Fire Chief Pete Tell said.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City Fire Chief Smokey Dyer said the fire risk soared overnight
because of damaged electrical connections caused by fallen power lines.</TE>
<TE>   "It was poppin' like the Fourth of July back there," said Doris McGee
after a tree limb pulled down the backyard power line to her home.</TE>
<TE>   The storm, centered over the Mississippi Valley, moved to the
northeast through the day, pushing into New York and sending snow into
New England. Up to a foot was forecast in some parts of the Northeast
today.</TE>
<TE>   Snow was piling up in New Hampshire late Thursday night as emergency
crews responded to scores of traffic accidents.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, the storm left 270,000 customers without power in Kansas
City and 200,000 more in Oklahoma. At least 185,000 were in the dark in
parts of Michigan and Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes this easily the worst storm we have ever experienced,"
said Kansas City Power and Light spokesman Tom Robinson. "We need our
customers to be prepared that this could last several days."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City residents left in the cold and the dark stocked up on
flashlights and cooking gas as temperatures dipped into the 20s. Utility
crews called in from Minnesota to Texas worked around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "Winter is back," said Dennis Burkheimer of the Iowa Department of
Transportation.</TE>
